The aboleth is a revolting fishlike amphibian found primarily in
subterranean lakes and rivers. An aboleth has a pink belly. Four
pulsating blueblack orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete
gray slime that smells like rancid grease. It uses its tail for
propulsion in the water and drags itself along with its tentacles on
land. An aboleth weighs about 6,500 pounds.

Aboleths speak their own language, as well as Undercommon and Aquan.

### Combat

An aboleth attacks by flailing with its long, slimy tentacles, though it
prefers to fight from a distance using its illusion powers.

### Enslave (Su)
Three times per day, an aboleth can attempt to enslave
any one living creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC
17 Will save or be affected as though by a *dominate person* spell
(caster level 16th). An enslaved creature obeys the aboleth's telepathic
commands until freed by *remove curse,* and can attempt a new Will save
every 24 hours to break free. The control is also broken if the aboleth
dies or travels more than 1 mile from its slave. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Psionics (Sp)
At will---*hypnotic pattern* (DC 15), *illusory wall*
(DC 17), *mirage arcana* (DC 18), *persistent image* (DC 18),
*programmed image* (DC 19), *project image* (DC 20), *veil* (DC 19).
Effective caster level 16th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Slime (Ex)
A blow from an aboleth's tentacle can cause a terrible
affliction. A creature hit by a tentacle must succeed on a DC 19
Fortitude save or begin to transform over the next 1d4+1 minutes, the
skin gradually becoming a clear, slimy membrane. An afflicted creature
must remain moistened with cool, fresh water or take 1d12 points of
damage every 10 minutes. The slime reduces the creature's natural armor
bonus by 1 (but never to less than 0). The save DC is
Constitution-based.

A *remove disease* spell cast before the transformation is complete will
restore an afflicted creature to normal. Afterward, however, only a
*heal* or *mass heal* spell can reverse the affliction.

### Mucus Cloud (Ex)
An aboleth underwater surrounds itself with a
viscous cloud of mucus roughly 1 foot thick. Any creature coming into
contact with and inhaling this substance must succeed on a DC 19
Fortitude save or lose the ability to breathe air for the next 3 hours.
An affected creature suffocates in 2d6 minutes if removed from the
water. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud and failing another
Fortitude save continues the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

### Skills
An aboleth has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

### Aboleth Mage

#### Combat

The save DC for the aboleth mage's transformation tentacle attack (DC
21) and its mucus cloud (DC 21) are adjusted for its higher Constitution
score. The save DC for its enslave ability (DC 16) is adjusted for its
lower Charisma score, as are the save DCs for its psionic abilities:
*Hypnotic pattern* (DC 14), *illusory wall* (DC 16), *mirage arcana* (DC
17), *persistent image* (DC 17), *programmed image* (DC 18), *project
image* (DC 19), *veil* (DC 18). Effective caster level 16th.

The aboleth mage uses a number of spells, such as *displacement*,
*greater invisibility*, and *wall of force,* to protect itself while
seizing control of its foes with spells and innate abilities.

*Typical Wizard Spells Prepared* (4/6/5/4/4/3; save DC 15 + spell
level): 0---*daze, detect magic* (2), *resistance*; 1st---*alarm, charm
person, color spray, mage armor, magic missile* (2); 2nd---*blur, bull's
strength, darkness, fox's cunning, see invisibilty;* 3rd---*dispel
magic, displacement,fly, lightning bolt;* 4th---*greater invisibility*,
*phantasmal killer, scrying, stoneskin;* 5th---*hold monster,* empowered
*lightning bolt, wall of force.*

Achaierais are massive, 15-foot-tall flightless birds that inhabit
lawful planes of battle and are only occasionally encountered elsewhere.

Achaierais speak Infernal. They weigh about 750 pounds.

### Combat

In close combat, an achaierai lashes out with two of its four legs and
snaps with its powerful beak. It makes frequent use of its Spring Attack
feat to strike quickly and then retreat out of range before an enemy can
counterattack.

An achaierai's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawfulaligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Black Cloud (Ex)
Up to three times per day an achaierai can release
a choking, toxic black cloud.

Those other than achaierai within 10 feet instantly take 2d6 points of
damage. They must also succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected
for 3 hours as though by an *insanity* spell (caster level 16th). The
save DC is Constitution-based.

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An allip is the spectral remains of someone driven to suicide by a
madness that afflicted it in life. It craves only revenge and
unrelentingly pursues those who tormented it in life and pushed it over
the brink.

An allip cannot speak intelligibly.

### Combat

An allip is unable to cause physical harm, although it doesn't appear to
know that. It keeps flailing away at enemies, yet it inflicts no wounds.

### Babble (Su)
An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself,
creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the
allip must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be affected as though by a
*hypnotism* spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting
compulsion effect.

Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip's
babble for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Madness (Su)
Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection,
mind control, or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its
tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.

### Wisdom Drain (Su)
An allip causes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain each
time it hits with its incorporeal touch attack. On each such successful
attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.

## Angel

Angels are a race of celestials, beings who live on the good-aligned
Outer Planes.

Angels can be of any good alignment. Regardless of their alignment,
angels never lie, cheat, or steal. They are impeccably honorable in all
their dealings and often prove the most trustworthy and diplomatic of
all the celestials.

All angels are blessed with comely looks, though their actual
appearances vary widely.

Angels speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, though they can speak
with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.

### Combat

In combat, most angels make full use of their mobility and their ability
to attack at a distance.

### Angel Traits
An angel possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

---Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

---Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.

---Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.

--- +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.

---*Protective Aura (Su):* Against attacks made or effects created by
evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a
+4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the
angel. Otherwise, it functions as a *magic circle against evil* effect
and a *lesser globe of invulnerability,* both with a radius of 20 feet
(caster level equals angel's HD). This aura can be dispelled, but the
angel can create it again as a free action on its next turn. (The
defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel's
statistics block.)

---*Tongues (Su):* All angels can speak with any creature that has a
language, as though using a *tongues* spell (caster level equal to
angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.

An astral deva is about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.

#### Combat

An astral deva is not afraid to enter melee combat. It takes a fierce

### Uncanny Dodge (Ex)
An astral deva retains its Dexterity bonus to AC
when flat-footed, and it cannot be flanked except by a rogue of at least

A planetar is nearly 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.

#### Combat

Despite their vast array of magical powers, planetars are likely to wade
into melee with their *+3 greatswords.* They particularly enjoy fighting
fiends.

A planetar's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Regeneration
A planetar takes damage from evil-aligned weapons and
from spells and effects with the evil descriptor.

### Spell-Like Abilities

A solar has a deep and commanding voice, and stands about 9 feet tall.

#### Combat

Solars are puissant champions of good. Only the most powerful fiends
approach their power.

Even more fearsome than their *+5 dancing greatswords* are their *+2
composite longbows* that create any sort of *slaying arrow* when drawn.

A solar's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
as good-aligned and epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A solar takes normal damage from epic
evil-aligned weapons, and from spells or effects with the evil
descriptor.

Animated objects come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. They owe their
existence as creatures to spells such as *animate objects* or similar
supernatural abilities.

### Combat

Animated objects fight only as directed by the animator. They follow
orders without question and to the best of their abilities. Since they
do not need to breathe and never tire, they can be extremely capable
minions.

An animated object can have one or more of the following special
abilities, depending on its form.

### Blind (Ex)
A sheetlike animated object such as a carpet or tapestry
can grapple an opponent up to three sizes larger than itself. The object
makes a normal grapple check. If it wins, it wraps itself around the
opponent's head, causing that creature to be blinded until removed.

### Constrict (Ex)
A flexible animated object such as a rope, vine, or
rug deals damage equal to its slam damage value plus 1- 1/2 times its
Strength bonus with a successful grapple check against a creature up to
one size larger than itself.

An object of at least Large size can make constriction attacks against
multiple creatures at once, if they all are at least two sizes smaller
than the object and can fit under it.

### Hardness (Ex)
An animated object has the same hardness it had
before it was animated.

### Improved Speed (Ex)
The base land speed given in the statistics
block assume that an animated object lurches, rocks, or slithers along.

Objects with two legs (statues, ladders) or a similar shape that allows
faster movement have a +10 foot bonus to speed. Objects with multiple
legs (tables, chairs) have a +20 foot bonus to speed. Wheeled objects
have a +40 foot bonus to speed.

Objects might have additional modes of movement. A wooden object can
float and has a swim speed equal to half its land speed. A rope or
similar sinuous object has a climb speed equal to half its land speed. A
sheetlike object can fly (clumsy maneuverability) at half its normal
speed.

### Trample (Ex)
An animated object of at least Large size and with a
hardness of at least 10 can trample creatures two or more sizes smaller
than itself, dealing damage equal to the object's slam damage + 1-1/2
times its Strength bonus. Opponents who do not make attacks of
opportunity against the object can attempt Reflex saves (DC 10 + 1/2
object's HD + object's Str modifier) to halve the damage.

## Ankheg

The ankheg is a burrowing monster with a taste for fresh meat. An ankheg
has six legs, and some specimens are yellow rather than brown. It is
about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.

An ankheg burrows with legs and mandibles. A burrowing ankheg usually
does not make a usable tunnel, but can construct a tunnel; it burrows at
half speed when it does so. It often digs a winding tunnel up to 40 feet
below the surface in the rich soil of forests or farmlands. The tunnel
is 5 feet tall and wide, and from 60 to 150 feet long (\[1d10 + 5\] x
10).

### Combat

An ankheg usually lies 5 to 10 feet below the surface until its antennae
detect the approach of prey. It then burrows up to attack. (Treat this
as a charge, even though the ankheg does not need to move 10 feet before
attacking.)

Clusters of ankhegs share the same territory but do not cooperate.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, an ankheg must hit with its
bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the ankheg is damaged
after grabbing its prey, it retreats backward down its tunnel at its
land speed (not its burrow speed), dragging the victim with it.

### Spit Acid (Ex)
30-ft. line, once every 6 hours; damage 4d4 acid,
Reflex DC 14 half. One such attack depletes the ankheg's acid supply for
6 hours. It cannot spit acid or deal acid damage during this time. The
save DC is Constitution-based.

An ankheg does not use this ability unless it is desperate or
frustrated. It most often spits acid when reduced to fewer than half its
full normal hit points or when it has not successfully grabbed an
opponent.

An aranea is an intelligent, shapechanging spider with sorcerous powers.
In its natural form, an aranea resembles a big spider, with a humpbacked
body a little bigger than a human torso. It has fanged mandibles like a
normal spider. Two small arms, each about 2 feet long, lie below the
mandibles. Each arm has a hand with four many-jointed fingers and a
double-jointed thumb.

An aranea weighs about 150 pounds. The hump on its back houses its
brain.

Araneas speak Common and Sylvan.

### Combat

An aranea avoids physical combat and uses its webs and spells when it
can. In a battle, it tries to immobilize or distract the most aggressive
opponents first. Araneas often subdue opponents for ransom.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Spells
An aranea casts spells as a 3rd-level sorcerer. It prefers
illusions and enchantments and avoids fire spells.

*Typical Sorcerer Spells Known* (6/6; save DC 12 + spell level): 0---
*daze, detect magic, ghost sound, light, resistance;* 1st---*mage armor,
silent image, sleep.*

### Web (Ex)
In spider or hybrid form (see below), an aranea can throw
a web up to six times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net
but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet,
and is effective against targets of up to Large size. The web anchors
the target in place, allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or
burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are
Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial
bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage
from fire.

### Change Shape (Su)
An aranea's natural form is that of a Medium
monstrous spider. It can assume two other forms. The first is a unique
Small or Medium humanoid; an aranea in its humanoid form always assumes
the same appearance and traits, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid
form, an aranea cannot use its bite attack, webs, or poison.

The second form is a Medium spider--humanoid hybrid. In hybrid form, an
aranea looks like a Medium humanoid at first glance, but a DC 18 Spot
check reveals the creature's fangs and spinnerets. The aranea retains
its bite attack, webs, and poison in this form, and can also wield
weapons or wear armor. When in hybrid form, an aranea's speed is 30 feet
(6 squares).

An aranea remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A
change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does an aranea revert to its
natural form when killed. A *true seeing* spell, however, reveals its
natural form if it is in humanoid or hybrid form.

### Skills
Araneas have a +2 racial bonus on Jump, Listen, and Spot
checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always
choose to take 10 on Climb checks even if rushed or threatened.

## Archon

Archons are celestials from a lawful good-aligned plane.

Archons speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with
almost any creature because of their tongues ability.

### Combat

Archons generally prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent to do
so, but if outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds (usually
by employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and engaging a foe with
magic before moving into melee).

### Archon Traits
An archon possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

---Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

---*Aura of Menace (Su):* A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight
or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon
must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies
with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial
bonus. Those who fail take a --2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for
24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the
aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be
affected again by the same archon's aura for 24 hours.

---Immunity to electricity and petrification.

--- +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.

---*Magic Circle against Evil (Su):* A magic circle against evil effect
always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the archon's Hit Dice).
(The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon's
statistics block.)

---*Teleport (Su):* Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the
spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only
itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.

---*Tongues (Su):* All archons can speak with any creature that has a
language, as though using a *tongues* spell (caster level 14th). This
ability is always active.

Lantern archons appear as floating balls of light that glow about as
brightly as a torch. Only their destruction can extinguish the glow,
though they can try to hide it.

#### Combat

A lantern archon has little reason to get within melee range. It usually
hovers just close enough to bring the enemy within its aura of menace,
then blasts away with its light rays. Lantern archons prefer to
concentrate on a single opponent, seeking to reduce enemy numbers
quickly.

### Aura of Menace (Su)
Will DC 12 negates.

### Light Ray (Ex)
A lantern archon's light rays have a range of 30
feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*aid, detect evil, continual flame.*
Caster level 3rd.

Hound archons look like well-muscled humans with canine heads.

#### Combat

Hound archons prefer to attack with their natural weapons but
occasionally use greatswords.

A hound archon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are

message.* Caster level 6th.

### Aura of Menace (Su)

form it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include any
doglike or wolflike animal of the animal type.

### Skills
\*While in canine form, a hound archon gains a +4
circumstance bonus on Hide and Survival checks.

### Hound Archon Hero

The hound archon hero is a mighty champion of justice, devoted to the
pursuit and destruction of evil in all its forms.

#### Combat

Hound archon heroes have over time developed a love for their weapons.
They prefer to use their *holy greatswords* over their bite and slam
attacks.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*aid, continual flame, detect evil,
message.* Caster level 6th.

### Hound Archon Hero Mounts

In the course of their adventures, many hound archon heroes befriend
bronze dragons, which may come to serve as their mounts. The
relationship between these mounts and their celestial riders goes beyond
even the special bond between paladin and mount. The dragon and the
archon are naturally allies and friends, as can be expected of two
powerful servants of cosmic justice. The juvenile bronze dragon mount
gains 2 additional HD, 4 points of Strength, an additional 4 points of
natural armor, improved evasion, and +10 feet to speed in all its
movement forms. The dragon cannot, however, command other creatures of
its type as other kinds of paladin mounts can.

Each Trumpet Archon carries a gleaming silver trumpet about 6 feet long.

#### Combat

A trumpet archon usually disdains physical combat, preferring to
obliterate foes with spells quickly and return to its duties. If forced
into an extended battle, it sounds its trumpet and attacks with a
vengeance.

A trumpet archon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as good-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*detect evil, continual flame,
message.* Caster level 12th.

### Aura of Menace (Su)
Will DC 21 negates.

### Spells
Trumpet archons can cast divine spells as 14th-level
clerics. A trumpet archon has access to two of the following domains:
Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others from its deity).
The save DCs are Wisdom-based.

*Typical Cleric Spells Prepared* (6/7/7/6/5/4/4/3; DC 13 + spell level):
0---*detect magic, light, purify food and drink, read magic, resistance*
(2); 1st---*bless* (2), *divine favor* (2), *protection from chaos\*,
sanctuary, shield of faith;* 2nd---*aid\*, bull's strength* (2),
*consecrate, lesser restoration, owl's wisdom* (2); 3rd---*daylight,
invisibility purge, magic circle against chaos\*, magic vestment,
protection from energy* (2); 4th--- *dismissal, divine power, holy
smite\*, neutralize poison, spell immunity;* 5th---*dispel evil\*, mass
cure light wounds, plane shift, raise dead;* 6th--- *blade barrier\*,
banishment, heal, undeath to death;* 7th---*dictum\*, holy word, mass
cure serious wounds.*

\*Domain spell. Domains: Good and Law.

### Trumpet (Su)
An archon's trumpet produces music of utter clarity,
piercing beauty, and, if the trumpet archon wills it, paralyzing awe.
All creatures except archons within 100 feet of the blast must succeed
on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
Charisma-based. The archon can also command its trumpet to become a *+4
greatsword* as a free action.

If a trumpet is ever stolen, it becomes a chunk of useless metal until
the owner can recover it. Woe betide any thief caught with one.

An arrowhawk is a predator and scavenger from the Elemental Plane of
Air. By twisting its body and varying the cadence of its wingbeats, an
arrowhawk can fly at top speed in any direction. A juvenile arrowhawk (1
to 10 years old) is about 5 feet long from beak to tail, with the body
accounting for about one-third of that length. Its wingspan is about 7
feet, and it weighs about 20 pounds. An adult (11 to 40 years old) is
about 10 feet long from beak to tail, with a wingspan of about 15 feet
and a weight of about 100 pounds. An elder arrowhawk (41 to 75 years
old) is about 20 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and a weight of
about 800 pounds.

Arrowhawks speak Auran, but they are not usually talkative creatures.

### Combat

Arrowhawks are extremely territorial and always hungry. They attack
almost any other creature they meet, seeking a meal or trying to drive
away a rival. The primary mode of attack is an electricity ray, fired
from the tail. The creature also bites, but it prefers to stay out of
reach.

### Electricity Ray (Su)
An arrowhawk can fire this ray once per round,
with a range of 50 feet.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant that collects its own grisly
fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses
near its roots.

A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller
vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6
inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer
they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The
fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries
make a heady wine.

An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but usually stays
put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity.

A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs,
volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have
thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and
white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine
growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving
colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant
and help conceal it.

### Combat

An assassin vine uses simple tactics:

It lies still until prey comes within reach, then attacks. It uses its
entangle ability both to catch prey and to deter counterattacks.

### Constrict (Ex)
An assassin vine deals 1d6+7 points of damage with a
successful grapple check.

### Entangle (Su)
An assassin vine can animate plants within 30 feet of
itself as a free action (Ref DC 13 partial).

The effect lasts until the vine dies or decides to end it (also a free
action). The save DC is Wisdom-based. The ability is otherwise similar
to *entangle* (caster level 4th).

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, an assassin vine must hit
with its slam attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Blindsight (Ex)
Assassin vines have no visual organs but can
ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.

### Camouflage (Ex)
Since an assassin vine looks like a normal plant
when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Spot check to notice it before it
attacks.

Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those
skills instead of Spot to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning
to notice the subterranean version.

The athach is a hulking, misshapen biped. An adult stands some 18 feet
tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. Athachs speak a crude dialect of
Giant.

### Combat

Athachs charge into melee combat unless their opponents are out of
reach, in which case they throw rocks. They sometimes try to overrun
armored opponents to reach unarmored opponents in back ranks. With its
first few melee attacks, an athach tends to flail about
indiscriminately. After a few rounds, it concentrates on foes that have
been hitting it most often and uses its bite on whoever has dealt it the
most damage.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

An avoral's bones are strong but hollow, so even the largest specimens
weigh no more than 120 pounds. An avoral is about 7 feet tall. Each of
an avoral's wings has a small hand at the midpoint. When the wings are
folded, these appendages are about where human hands would be and can do
nearly anything hands can do.

An avoral's visual acuity is virtually unmatched: It can see detail on
objects up to 10 miles away and is said to be able to discern the color
of a creature's eyes at 200 paces.

Avorals speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with
almost any creature, thanks to their *tongues* ability.

### Combat

On the ground, an avoral can lash out with its wings to deliver
punishing blows. However, it prefers to meet its foes in the air, where
it can employ its talons and make full use of its aerial speed and
agility. It can't make wing attacks while flying, however.

An avoral's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*aid, blur* (self only), *command*
(DC 14), *detect magic, dimension door, dispel magic, gust of wind* (DC
15), *hold person* (DC 16), *light, magic circle against evil* (self
only), *magic missile, see invisibility;* 3/day---*lightning bolt* (DC
16). Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Fear Aura (Su)
Once per day an avoral can create an aura of fear in
a 20-foot radius. It is otherwise identical with *fear* from an
8th-level caster (save DC 17). The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Lay on Hands (Su)
As the paladin class feature, except that each
day, an avoral can heal an amount of damage equal to its full normal hit
points.

### Speak with Animals (Su)
This ability works like *speak with
animals* (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require
sound.

### True Seeing (Su)
This ability is identical with *true seeing*
(caster level 14th), except that it has personal range and the avoral
must concentrate for 1 full round before it takes effect. Thereafter the
ability remains in effect as long as the avoral concentrates on it.

### Skills
An avoral's sharp eyes give it a +8 racial bonus on Spot
checks.

Azers are dwarflike beings native to the Elemental Plane of Fire. They
wear kilts of brass, bronze, or copper, and speak Ignan and Common.

### Combat

Azers use broad-headed spears or well-crafted hammers in combat. When
unarmed, they attempt to grapple foes.

Although unfriendly and taciturn, azers rarely provoke a fight except to
relieve a foe of gems, which they love. If threatened, they fight to the
death, but they see the value of taking prisoners themselves.

### Heat (Ex)
An azer's body is intensely hot, so its unarmed attacks
deal extra fire damage. Its metallic weapons also conduct this heat.

### Azers as Characters

Azer characters possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2
Wisdom, --2 Charisma.

---An azer's base land speed is 30 feet.

bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +3, and Will +3.

---Racial Skills: An azer's outsider levels give it skill points equal
to 5 x (8 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Appraise, Climb, Craft,
Hide, Jump, Listen, Search, and Spot.

---Racial Feats: An azer's outsider levels give it one feat.

--- +6 natural armor bonus.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a
goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a goblin--wolf hybrid with
terrible jaws and sharp claws. As whelps, barghests are nearly
indistinguishable from wolves, except for their size and claws. As they
grow larger and stronger, their skin darkens to bluishred and eventually
becomes blue altogether.

A full-grown barghest is about 6 feet long and weighs 180 pounds. A
barghest's eyes glow orange when the creature becomes excited.

Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal.

### Combat

Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their form, and usually
disdain weapons. Though they love killing, they have little stomach for
direct combat and attack from ambush whenever possible. Barghests start
a combat by using *crushing despair* and *charm monster* to keep
opponents off balance. They try to stay away from the enemy's main
strength.

A barghest's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*blink, levitate, misdirection* (DC
14), *rage* (DC 15); 1/day---*charm monster* (DC 16), *crushing despair*
(DC 16), *dimension door.* Caster level equals the barghest's HD.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Feed (Su)
When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on
the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action.
Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or
resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance
that a *wish, miracle,* or *true resurrection* spell can restore a
devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the
check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal
magic.

A barghest advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion.
For every three suitable corpses a barghest devours, it gains 1 Hit Die,
and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its
attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit
Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements
normally.

The barghest only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose
Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A
barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a
greater barghest upon completion of the act.

### Change Shape (Su)
A barghest can assume the shape of a goblin or a
wolf as a standard action. In goblin form, a barghest cannot use its
natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In wolf form, a
barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.

### Pass Without Trace (Ex)
A barghest in wolf form can use pass
without trace (as the spell) as a free action.

### Skills
\*A barghest in wolf form gains a +4 circumstance bonus on
Hide checks.

### Greater Barghest

A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding becomes a greater
barghest. These creatures can change shape into a goblinlike creature of
Large size (about 8 feet tall and 400 pounds) or a dire wolf. In goblin
form, a greater barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield
weapons and wear armor. In dire wolf form, a greater barghest loses its
claw attacks but retains its bite attack.

A greater barghest can reach a maximum of 18 Hit Dice through feeding.

### Spell-Like Abilities
In addition to the spelllike abilities all
barghests possess, a greater barghest gains the following abilities. At
will---*invisibility sphere;* 1/day---*mass bull's strength*, *mass
enlarge.* Caster level equals the greater barghest's HD.

#### Combat

Occasionally, a greater barghest uses a magic two-handed weapon in
combat instead of its claws, giving it multiple attacks (attack bonus
+13/+8). It can also make one bite attack (attack bonus +8) each round.
The save DC against a greater barghest's spell-like abilities is 14 +
spell level.

A basilisk is a reptilian monster that petrifies living creatures with a
mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish
underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An
adult basilisk's body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its
tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature
weighs about 300 pounds.

### Combat

A basilisk relies on its gaze attack, biting only when opponents come
within reach. Though it has eight legs, its slow metabolism renders it
relatively sluggish, so it does not expend energy unnecessarily.
Intruders who flee a basilisk rather than fight can expect, at best, a
halfhearted pursuit. These creatures tend to spend most of their time
lying in wait for prey, which includes small mammals, birds, reptiles,
and similar creatures.

### Petrifying Gaze (Su)
Turn to stone permanently, range 30 feet;
Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Skills
\*The basilisk's dull coloration and its ability to remain
motionless for long periods of time grant it a +4 racial bonus on Hide
checks in natural settings.

### Abyssal Greater Basilisk

#### Combat

The save DC for the abyssal greater basilisk's petrifying gaze (DC 21)
is adjusted for its greater Hit Dice and higher Charisma score.

An abyssal greater basilisk's natural weapons are treated as magic
weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Smite Good (Su)
Once per day an abyssal greater basilisk can make a
normal melee attack to deal an extra 18 points of damage against a good
foe.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or use
its dozen legs to move with considerable speed. A behir is about 40 feet
long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. It can fold its limbs close to its
long, narrow body and slither in snake fashion if it desires. The
coloration of behirs ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of
gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back
over the head look dangerous but are actually used for preening the
creature's scales, not for fighting.

Behirs speak Common.

### Combat

A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows or
constricts the opponent. It can employ its claws only against foes
caught in its coils. If beset by a large number of foes, it uses its
breath weapon.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
20-foot line, once every 10 rounds, damage 7d6
electricity, Reflex DC 19 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Constrict (Ex)
A behir deals 2d8+8 points of damage with a
successful grapple check. It can make six rake attacks against a
grappled foe as well.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a behir must hit a creature
of any size with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple
as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it it establishes a hold and can attempt
to constrict the opponent or swallow the opponent in the following
round.

### Rake (Ex)
Six claws, attack bonus +15 melee, damage 1d4+4.

### Swallow Whole (Ex)
A behir can try to swallow a grabbed Medium or
smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check.

A behir that swallows an opponent can use its Cleave feat to bite and
grab another opponent.

A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8
points of acid damage per round from the behir's gizzard. A swallowed
creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing
weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the
creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out.

A behir's gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive
or smaller opponents.

### Skills
Behirs have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always
choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Belkers are creatures from the Plane of Air. They are composed primarily
of smoke. Although undeniably evil, they are very reclusive and usually
have no interest in the affairs of others. A belker's winged shape makes
it look distinctly demonic. It is about 7 feet long and weighs about 8
pounds.

Belkers speak Auran.

### Combat

In most cases, a belker fights with its nasty claws and painful bite.

### Smoke Claws (Ex)
A belker in smoke form (see below) can engulf
opponents by moving on top of them. It fills the air around one Medium
or smaller opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity. The
target must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or inhale part of the
creature. The save DC is Constitution-based. Smoke inside the victim
solidifies into a claw and begins to rip at the surrounding organs,
dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. An affected creature can attempt
another Fortitude save each subsequent round to cough out the
semivaporous menace.

### Smoke Form (Su)
Most of the time a belker is more or less solid,
but at will it can assume smoke form. It can switch forms once per round
as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in smoke form. A
belker in smoke form can fly at a speed of 50 feet (perfect). The
ability is otherwise similar to a *gaseous form* spell (caster level
7th).

### Skills
Belkers have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited teleportation
ability.

Blink dogs have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps, whines,
and growls that can transmit complex information.

### Combat

Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in a seemingly random fashion
until they surround their prey, allowing some of them to take advantage
of flanking.

### Blink (Su)
A blink dog can use *blink* as the spell (caster level
8th), and can evoke or end the effect as a free action.

### Dimension Door (Su)
A blink dog can teleport, as *dimension door*
(caster level 8th), once per round as a free action. The ability affects
only the blink dog, which never appears within a solid object and can
act immediately after teleporting.

Bodaks are the undead remnants of humanoids who have been destroyed by
the touch of absolute evil.

A bodak retains fleeting memories of its past life and can speak Common
(or some other humanoid language).

### Combat

### Death Gaze (Su)
Death, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates.
Humanoids who die from this attack are transformed into bodaks 24 hours
later. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)
Bodaks loathe sunlight, for its
merest touch burns their impure flesh. Each round of exposure to the
direct rays of the sun deals 1 point of damage to the creature.

In addition to their natural form, bralanis can assume the shape of a
whirlwind or zephyr of dust, snow, or sand.

Bralanis speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate
with almost any creature, thanks to their *tongues* ability.

### Combat

Bralanis prefer the scimitar and bow, the weapons of the desert nomads
they most closely resemble.

A bralani's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will--- *blur, charm person* (DC 13), *gust
of wind* (DC 14), *mirror image, wind wall;* 2/day---*lightning bolt*
(DC 15), *cure serious wounds* (DC 15). Caster level 6th. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

### Whirlwind Blast (Su)
When in whirlwind form, a bralani can attack
with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of damage in a 20-foot
line (Reflex DC 16 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A bralani can shift between its humanoid and
whirlwind forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or
use its whirlwind blast, but it can use its spell-like abilities and its
weapons. In whirlwind form, it can fly, make slam attacks and whirlwind
blast attacks, and use spell-like abilities.

A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A
change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any
particular form when killed. A *true seeing* spell, however, reveals
both forms simultaneously.

### Tongues (Su)
Bralanis can speak with any creature that has a
language, as though using a *tongues* spell (caster level 14th). This
ability is always active.

Also known as the landshark, the bulette is a terrifying predator that
lives only to eat.

### Combat

A bulette attacks anything it regards as edible, choosing the easiest or
closest prey first. The only creatures it refuses to eat are elves (and
it dislikes the taste of dwarves). When burrowing underground, a
landshark relies on its tremorsense ability to detect prey.

When it senses something edible (that is, senses movement), it breaks to
the surface, crest first, and begins its attack.

### Leap (Ex)
A bulette can jump into the air during combat. This
allows it to make four claw attacks instead of two, each with a +15
attack bonus, but it cannot bite.

## Celestial Creature

Celestial creatures dwell on the upper planes, the realms of good,
although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more
regal and more beautiful than their earthly counterparts.

Celestial creatures often come in metallic colors (usually silver, gold,
or platinum). They can be mistaken for half-celestials, more powerful
creatures that are created when a celestial mates with a non-celestial
creature.

### Creating a Celestial Creature

"Celestial" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal
animal, aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast,
monstrous humanoid, plant, or vermin of good or neutral alignment
(referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A celestial creature uses all the base creature's statistics and
abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit
Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes.

### Size and Type
Animals or vermin with this template become magical
beasts, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged.
Celestial creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the
extraplanar subtype.

### Special Attacks
A celestial creature retains all the special
attacks of the base creature and also gains the following attack.

*Smite Evil (Su):* Once per day a celestial creature can make a normal
melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20)
against an evil foe.

### Special Qualities
A celestial creature retains all the special
qualities of the base creature and also gains the following qualities.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Damage reduction (see the table below).

---Resistance to acid, cold, and electricity (see the table below).

---Spell resistance equal to HD + 5 (maximum 25).

  ------------ --------------------------------------- ------------------
  Hit Dice     Resistance to Acid, Cold, Electricity   Damage Reduction
  1--3         5                                       ---
  4--7         5                                       5/magic
  8--11        10                                      5/magic
  12 or more   10                                      10/magic
  ------------ --------------------------------------- ------------------

If the base creature already has one or more of these special qualities,
use the better value.

If a celestial creature gains damage reduction, its natural weapons are
treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Abilities
Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least
3.

### Environment
Any good-aligned plane.

### Challenge Rating
HD 3 or less, as base creature; HD 4 to 7, as base
creature +1; HD 8 or more, as base creature +2.

### Alignment
Always good (any).

### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +2.

The horrific creatures known as chaos beasts have mutable, ever-changing
forms. A chaos beast's dimensions vary, but it always weighs about 200
pounds.

Chaos beasts do not speak.

### Combat

For all its fearsome appearances, whether it has claws, fangs, pincers,
tentacles, or spines, a chaos beast does little physical harm.
Regardless of form, the creature seems unable to manage more than two
attacks per round. Its continual transmutations prevent the coordination
needed to do more.

A chaos beast's claw attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Corporeal Instability (Su)
A blow from a chaos beast against a
living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must
succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass.
Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape
melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC is Constitution-based.

An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor,
rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried---armor,
backpacks, even shirts---hamper more than help, reducing the victim's
Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10
feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses
along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The
victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly,
unable to distinguish friend from foe (--4 penalty on attack rolls and a
50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).

Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of
Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom score falls to 0,
it becomes a chaos beast.

A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt
a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast
with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the
creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still
repeat this check each round until successful.

Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to
remove. A *shapechange* or *stoneskin* spell does not cure an afflicted
creature but fixes its form for the duration of the spell. A
*restoration, heal,* or *greater restoration* spell removes the
affliction (a separate *restoration* is necessary to restore any drained
points of Wisdom).

### Immunity to Transformation (Ex)
No mortal magic can permanently
affect or fix a chaos beast's form. Effects such as polymorphing or
petrification force the creature into a new shape, but at the start of
its next turn it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free
action.

A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and
weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera's dragon head might be black, blue,
green, red, or white.

Chimeras can speak Draconic but seldom bother to do so, except when
toadying to more powerful creatures.

### Combat

The chimera prefers to surprise prey. It often swoops down from the sky
or lies concealed until it charges. The dragon head can loose a breath
weapon instead of biting. Several chimeras attack in concert.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A chimera's breath weapon depends on the color
of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its
type, a chimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals
3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 17 Reflex save for half damage.
The save DC is Constitution-based.

To determine a chimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll
1d10 and consult the table below.

  ------- ------------ ----------------------------
  1d10    Head Color   Breath Weapon
  1--2    Black        40-foot line of acid
  3--4    Blue         40-foot line of lightning
  5--6    Green        20-foot cone of gas (acid)
  7--8    Red          20-foot cone of fire
  9--10   White        20-foot cone of cold
  ------- ------------ ----------------------------

### Skills
A chimera's three heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Spot
and Listen checks.

\*In areas of scrubland or brush, a chimera gains a +4 racial bonus on
Hide checks.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a chimera is up to 348 pounds; a
medium load, 349--699 pounds, and a heavy load, 700--1,050 pounds.

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

These vicious little predators lurk underground, grabbing whatever prey
happens by. Its hands and feet have spiny pads that help the choker grip
almost any surface. The creature weighs about 35 pounds.

Chokers speak Undercommon.

### Combat

A choker likes to perch near the ceiling, often at intersections,
archways, wells, or staircases, and reach down to attack its prey. A
choker attacks creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of
its size or larger. If one is very hungry, it may attack a group, but it
waits to grab the last creature in line.

### Constrict (Ex)
A choker deals 1d3+3 points of damage with a
successful grapple check against a Large or smaller creature. Because it
seizes its victim by the neck, a creature in the choker's grasp cannot
speak or cast spells with verbal components.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a choker must hit a Large
or smaller opponent with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start
a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Chokers receive a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks, which is already
included in the statistics block.

### Quickness (Su)
Although not particularly dexterous, a choker is
supernaturally quick. It can take an extra standard action or move
action during its turn each round.

### Skills
A chokers has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------

A horrible mix of crustacean, insect, and serpent, the chuul is an
abomination that lurks submerged or partially submerged, awaiting
intelligent prey to devour. Although amphibious, chuuls are not good
swimmers and actually prefer to be on land or in very shallow water when
they attack. A chuul is about 8 feet long and weighs 650 pounds.

Chuuls speak Common (or Undercommon, for the underground variety).

### Combat

A chuul prefers to wait by the shore, submerged in murky water, until it
hears nearby prey (in or out of the water) that it can attack with
surprise. A chuul grabs with its claws and constricts its foe, then
passes the opponent to its paralytic tentacles. It tries to always have
one claw free, so if it faces a large number of opponents, it drops a
paralyzed or dead victim and continues attempting to grab, constrict,
and paralyze the rest.

### Constrict (Ex)
On a successful grapple check, a chuul deals 3d6+5
points of damage.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a chuul must hit with a
claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict or on its next turn
transfer a grabbed opponent to its tentacles.

### Paralytic Tentacles (Ex)
A chuul can transfer grabbed victims from
a claw to its ten- tacles as a move action. The tentacles grapple with
the same strength as the claw but deal no damage. However, they exude a
paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a DC
19 Fortitude save each round on the chuul's turn or be paralyzed for 6
rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles,
paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes 1d8+2 points of damage
each round from the creature's mandibles.

### Amphibious (Ex)
Although chuuls are aquatic, they can survive
indefinitely on land.

### Skills
A chuul has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

When resting or lying in wait, these creatures are almost impossible to
distinguish from common black cloaks (the cloaker's ivory claws look
very much like bone clasps). Only when it unfurls does the horrific
nature of the creature become apparent.

A cloaker has a wingspan of about 8 feet. It weighs about 100 pounds.

Cloakers speak Undercommon.

### Combat

Cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for prey. If facing a
single opponent, a cloaker uses its engulf attack. Against multiple
foes, it lashes with its tail in concert with its moan and shadow shift
abilities to reduce the opposition's numbers, then engulfs a survivor.
Multiple cloakers usually split up, leaving one or two behind to use
special abilities while the rest make melee attacks.

### Moan (Ex)
A cloaker can emit a dangerous subsonic moan as a
standard action. By changing the frequency, the cloaker can cause one of
four effects. Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mindaffecting attacks.
Unless otherwise specified, a creature that successfully saves against
one of these effects cannot be affected by the same moan effect from the
same cloaker for 24 hours. All save DCs for moan effects are
Charisma-based.

*Unnerve:* Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a --2
penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced to hear the moan for
more than 6 consecutive rounds must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or
enter a trance, unable to attack or defend themselves until the moaning
stops.

*Fear:* Anyone within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will save
or become panicked for 2 rounds.

*Nausea:* Anyone in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude
save or be overcome by nausea and weakness.

Affected characters fall prone and become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds.

*Stupor:* A single creature within 30 feet of the cloaker must succeed
on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a *hold monster*
spell for 5 rounds. Even after a successful save, the creature must
repeat the save if the cloaker uses this effect again.

### Engulf (Ex)
A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature
in its body as a standard action. The cloaker attempts a grapple that
does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,
it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on
its attack roll. It can still use its whiplike tail to strike at other
targets.

Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the
monster and half to the trapped victim.

### Shadow Shift (Su)
A cloaker can manipulate shadows. This ability is
effective only in shadowy areas and has three possible effects.

*Obscure Vision:* The cloaker gains concealment (20% miss chance) for
1d4 rounds.

*Dancing Images:* This effect duplicates a *mirror image* spell (caster
level 6th).

*Silent Image:* This effect duplicates a *silent image* spell (DC 15,
caster level 6th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------

A male cockatrice has wattles and a comb, just like a rooster. Females,
much rarer than males, differ only in that they have no wattles or comb.
A cockatrice weighs about 25 pounds.

### Combat

A cockatrice fiercely attacks anything that it deems a threat to itself
or its lair. Flocks of cockatrices do their utmost to overwhelm and
confuse their foes, and sometimes fly directly into their opponents'
faces.

### Petrification (Su)
Creatures hit by a cockatrice's bite attack must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or instantly turn to stone. The save
DC is Constitution-based. Cockatrices have immunity to the petrification
ability of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect
them normally.

A couatl is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of about 15 feet. It
weighs about 1,800 pounds.

Couatls speak Celestial, Common, and Draconic, and also have the power
of telepathy (see below).

### Combat

A couatl uses its *detect thoughts* ability on any creature that arouses
its suspicions. Since it is highly intelligent, a couatl usually casts
spells from a distance before closing. If more than one couatl is
involved, they discuss their strategy before a battle.

### Constrict (Ex)
A couatl deals 2d8+6 points of damage with a
successful grapple check.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a couatl must hit a
creature of up to two size categories larger with its bite attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking
an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can constrict.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial damage 2d4 Str,
secondary damage 4d4 Str.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Psionics (Sp)
At will---*detect chaos, detect evil, detect good,
detect law, detect thoughts* (DC 15), *invisibility, plane shift* (DC
20), *polymorph* (self only). Effective caster level 9th. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

### Spells
A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.

It can choose its spells known from the sorcerer list, the cleric list,
and from the lists for the Air, Good, and Law domains. The cleric spells
and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning
that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.

*Typical Spells Known* (6/7/7/7/4; save DC 13 + spell level): 0---*cure
minor wounds, daze, disrupt undead, light, obscuring mist, ray of frost,
read magic, resistance;* 1st---*endure elements, mage armor, protection
from chaos, true strike, wind wall;* 2nd---*cure moderate wounds,
eagle's splendor, scorching ray, silence;* 3rd---*gaseous form, magic
circle against evil, summon monster III;* 4th--- *charm monster, freedom
of movement.*

### Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
This ability works like the *ethereal jaunt*
spell (caster level 16th).

### Telepathy (Su)
A couatl can communicate telepathically with any
creature within 90 feet that has an Intelligence score. The creature can
respond to the couatl if it wishes---no common language is needed.

  Challenge Rating:      1
  Treasure:              None

  Level Adjustment:      ---
  ---------------------- ----------------------------------------------------

The darkmantle hangs from a ceiling by a muscular "foot" at the top of
its body. It can look like a stalactite, by holding its tentacles
stiffly under itself, or like a lump of rock, spreading its tentacles so
the membrane between them covers its body. Its shell and skin usually
resemble limestone, but a darkmantle can change its color to match
almost any type of stony background.

A darkmantle is about 4 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the
top of its head. It weighs about 30 pounds.

### Combat

A darkmantle attacks by dropping onto its prey and wrapping its
tentacles around the opponent's head. Once attached, it squeezes and
tries to suffocate the foe. A darkmantle that misses its initial attack
often flies up and tries to drop on the opponent again.

### Darkness (Su)
Once per day a darkmantle can cause darkness as the
*darkness* spell (caster level 5th). It most often uses this ability
just before attacking.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a darkmantle must hit a
Large or smaller creature with its slam attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it attaches to the opponent's head and can
constrict.

### Constrict (Ex)
A darkmantle deals 1d4+4 points of damage with a
successful grapple check.

### Blindsight (Ex)
A darkmantle can "see" by emitting high-frequency
sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain
objects and creatures within 90 feet. A *silence* spell negates this
ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle.

### Skills
A darkmantle has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated. The creature's
variable coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

A delver is about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. It weighs about 6,000
pounds.

Delvers speak Terran and Undercommon.

### Combat

A delver prefers to fight from its tunnel, which it uses to protect its
flanks while lashing out with its flippers.

A delver expecting trouble may honeycomb an area with tunnels, leaving
most closed with layers of stone 1 or 2 inches thick.

The delver can quickly dissolve the stone cover and pop up to attack
unexpectedly.

### Corrosive Slime (Ex)
A delver produces a mucuslike slime that
contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly
effective against stone. A delver's mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid
damage to organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or
objects, a delver's slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against stony
creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points
of damage. A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals
2d6 points of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each
of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or
weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An opponent's armor
and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless the wearer
succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. Weapons that strike a delver also
dissolve immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save.
A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons takes damage from its
slime each time an attack hits unless the creature succeeds on a DC 22
Reflex save. These save DCs are Constitution-based.

### Stone Shape (Ex)
A delver can alter its slime to temporarily soften
stone instead of dissolving it. Once every 10 minutes, a delver can
soften and shape up to 25 cubic feet of stone, as a *stone shape* spell
(caster level 15th).

## Demon

Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes.
They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the
sheer fun of it---even other demons.

Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature's entry).

---Immunity to electricity and poison.

---Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10.

---*Summon* (Sp): Many demons share the ability to summon others of
their kind (the success chance and type of demon summoned are noted in
each monster description). Demons are often reluctant to use this power
until in obvious peril or extreme circumstances.

---Telepathy.

Except where otherwise noted, demons speak Abyssal, Celestial, and
Draconic.

A babau is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 140 pounds.

#### Combat

Babaus are sneaky and sly. They attack the most powerful foe first,
hoping to eliminate the true threats quickly and then toy with the rest.
When ambushing their opponents, they make excellent use of the
combination of multiple attacks and sneak attacks.

A babau's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Sneak Attack (Ex)
A babau can make a sneak attack like a rogue,
dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage whenever a foe is denied his or
her Dexterity bonus, or when the babau is flanking.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*darkness, dispel magic, see
invisibility*, *greater teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only).
Caster level 7th.

### Protective Slime (Su)
A slimy red jelly coats the babau's skin. Any
weapon that touches it takes 1d8 points of acid damage from the
corrosive goo, and the weapon's hardness does not reduce this damage. A
magic weapon may attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid taking this
damage. A creature who strikes the babau with an unarmed attack, unarmed
strike, touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage as well but can
negate the damage with a DC 18 Reflex save. The save DCs are
Constitution-based.

***Summon Demon* (Sp):**Once per day a babau can attempt to summon 1
babau with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a
3rd-level spell.

### Skills
Babaus have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, and Search checks.

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A balor stands about 12 feet tall. Its skin is usually dark red. It
weighs about 4,500 pounds.

#### Combat

Balors love to join battle armed with their swords and whips. If they
face stiff resistance, they may teleport away to loose a few spell-like
effects at the foe.

A balor's *+1 flaming whip* is a long, flexible weapon with many tails
tipped with hooks, spikes, and balls. The weapon deals bludgeoning and
slashing damage, in addition to fire damage.

A balor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

**Death Throes (Ex):**When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding flash
of light that deals 100 points of damage to anything within 100 feet
(Reflex DC 30 half ). This explosion automatically destroys any weapons
the balor is holding. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Entangle (Ex)
A balor's *+1 flaming whip* entangles foes much like
an attack with a net. The whip has 20 hit points. The whip needs no
folding. If it hits, the target and the balor immediately make opposed
Strength checks; if the balor wins, it drags the target against its
flaming body (see below). The target remains anchored against the
balor's body until it escapes the whip.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will--- *blasphemy* (DC 25), *dominate
monster* (DC 27), *greater dispel magic, greater teleport* (self plus 50
pounds of objects only), *insanity* (DC 25), *power word stun,
telekinesis* (DC 23), *unholy aura* (DC 26); 1/day---*fire storm* (DC
26), *implosion* (DC 27). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Vorpal Sword (Su)
Every balor carries a *+1 vorpal longsword* that
looks like a flame or a bolt of lightning.

### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a balor can automatically summon
4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrous, or one nalfeshnee, glabrezu, marilith, or
balor. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

### Flaming Body (Su)
The body of a balor is wreathed in flame.

Anyone grappling a balor takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round.

### True Seeing (Su)
Balors have a continuous true seeing ability, as
the spell (caster level 20th).

### Skills
Balors have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

#### Tactics Round-by-Round

The balor is most effective as a ranged combatant, using its spell-like
abilities to attack from a distance.

Prior to combat: Unholy aura.

*Round 1: Fire storm* or *implosion* and quickened *telekinesis,* or
summon additional demons. If the balor does not deem itself seriously
threatened, it conserves abilities usable only once per day and uses
*blasphemy* instead.

*Round 2: Insanity* or *power word stun.*

*Round 3:* Full melee attack with weapons, including entangle with whip.

*Round 4: Teleport* or fly away with entangled foe to reestablish range;
repeat round 1 and continue.

A balor who wants to drive off or neutralize a party without slaying its
foes avoids lethal attacks.

Prior to combat: Unholy aura.

Round 1: Dominate monster.

Round 2: Power word stun.

*Round 3: Insanity* or *telekinesis* to incapacitate or repel a
dangerous opponent.

*Round 4: Teleport* or fly away to reestablish range; repeat round 1 and
continue.

Bebiliths are enormous, predatory, arachnid demons that hunt other
demons. A bebilith has a body the size of a plow horse, with legs
spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs more than two tons.

Bebiliths understand but do not speak Abyssal. Their telepathy allows
them to communicate silently with one another.

### Combat

A bebilith attacks any creature it sees. It usually picks one target and
concentrates its attacks on that opponent, using its webs to isolate the
target from its comrades. Should the bebilith become overwhelmed by
tougher opponents, it often attempts to bite one or more of its victims
and retreats, allowing its poison to do its work.

A bebilith's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial damage 1d6 Con,
secondary damage 2d6 Con. Bebilith venom is highly perishable, losing
its potency and becoming inert, foul-smelling goo almost as soon as it
comes into contact with air. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Rend Armor (Ex)
If a bebilith hits with both claw attacks, it pulls
apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 4d6+18 points of
damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures not wearing armor are
unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is
destroyed. Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft
(armorsmithing) check.

### Web (Ex)
A bebilith can throw a web up to four times per day. This
is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 30 feet,
with a range increment of 10 feet. This attack is effective against
targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place,
allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 24 Escape Artist check or
burst the web with a DC 24 Strength check. The check DCs are
Constitution-based. The web has 14 hit points and hardness 0. There is a
75% chance that the webbing will not burn if any sort of fire is applied
to it (check each round).

### Plane Shift (Su)
This ability affects only the bebilith. It is
otherwise similar to the spell (caster level 12th).

### Skills
A bebilith has mottled coloration that gives it a +8 racial
bonus on Hide checks.

### Dretch

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A dretch is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.

Dretches cannot speak but can communicate telepathically.

#### Combat

Dretches are slow, stupid, and not very effective combatants. In
one-on-one combat, they rely on their damage reduction to keep them
alive. In groups, they depend on sheer numbers to overcome foes and
immediately summon other dretches to improve the odds in battle. They
flee at the first sign of adversity unless more powerful demons are
present to intimidate them into fighting. Dretches' fear of their
greater kin is stronger then even their fear of death.

A dretch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
1/day---*scare* (DC 12), *stinking cloud* (DC
13). Caster level 2nd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a dretch can attempt to summon
another dretch with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the
equivalent of a 1st-level spell.

### Telepathy (Su)
Dretches can communicate telepathically with
creatures within 100 feet that speak Abyssal.

### Glabrezu

Like succubi, glabrezu tempt victims into ruin, but they lure their prey
with power or wealth rather than passion.

Glabrezu have penetrating violet eyes, and their skin color ranges from
deep russet to pitch black. A glabrezu stands about 15 feet tall and
weighs about 5,500 pounds.

#### Combat

Glabrezu prefer subterfuge to combat. However, if their attempts to
entice or deceive fail, these enormous demons attack with a vengeance.
They follow a *confusion* attack with melee attacks, hoping to finish
off wounded foes with *chaos hammer* or *unholy blight.*

A glabrezu's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a glabrezu must hit a
Medium or smaller opponent with a pincer attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*chaos hammer* (DC 19), *confusion*
(DC 19), *dispel magic, mirror image, reverse gravity* (DC 22), *greater
teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *unholy blight* (DC
19); 1/day---*power word stun*. Caster level 14th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

Once per month, a glabrezu can fulfill a *wish* for a mortal humanoid.
The demon can use this ability to offer a mortal whatever he or she
desires---but unless the *wish* is used to create pain and suffering in
the world, the glabrezu demands either terrible evil acts or great
sacrifice as compensation.

### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a glabrezu can attempt to summon
4d10 dretches or 1d2 vrocks with a 50% chance of success, or another
glabrezu with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of
a 4th-level spell.

### True Seeing (Su)
Glabrezu continuously use true seeing as the spell
(caster level 14th).

### Skills
Glabrezu have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

### Hezrou

A hezrou can walk both upright and on all fours, but it always fights
standing up

A hezrou is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 750 pounds.

#### Combat

Hezrous enjoy melee combat even more than vrocks do. They eagerly press
an attack deep into the heart of enemy forces, so their stench can take
effect as quickly as possible. They enter most battles by using
*blasphemy,* and follow it with an occasional *chaos hammer* or *unholy
blight,* depending on the alignment of their opponents.

A hezrou's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a hezrou must hit with both
claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*chaos hammer* (DC 18), *greater
teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *unholy blight* (DC
18); 3/day---*blasphemy* (DC 21), *gaseous form.* Caster level 13th. The
save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Stench (Ex)
A hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid
whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10
feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long
as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward.
Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain
in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again
by the same hezrou's stench for 24 hours. A *delay poison* or
*neutralize poison* spell removes either condition from one creature.
Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures
resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws..
The save DC is Constitution-based.

### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a hezrou can attempt to summon
4d10 dretches or another hezrou with a 35% chance of success. This
ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

### Skills
Hezrous have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

A marilith usually holds a longsword in each of its six hands and wears
many bangles and jewels.

A marilith stands about 9 feet tall and measures about 20 feet from head
to tip of tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.

#### Combat

Though mariliths thrive on grand strategy and army-level tactics, they
love physical combat and never pass up an opportunity to fight. Each of
a marilith's six arms can wield a weapon, and the creature gets an
additional three weapon attacks with its primary arm. Mariliths seldom
rush headlong into battle, however, preferring to hang back and size up
the situation first. They always seek to gain the best possible
advantage from the local terrain, obstacles, and any vulnerability or
weakness in their opponents.

A marilith's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Constrict (Ex)
A marilith deals 4d6+13 points of damage with a
successful grapple check. The constricted creature must succeed on a DC
27 Fortitude save or lose consciousness for as long as it remains in the
coils and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Strength-based.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a marilith must hit with
its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it succeeds on the
grapple check, it can constrict.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*align weapon, blade barrier* (DC
23), *magic weapon, project image* (DC 23), *polymorph, see
invisibility, telekinesis* (DC 22), *greater teleport* (self plus 50
pounds of objects only), *unholy aura* (DC 25). Caster level 16th. The
save DCs are Charisma-based.

### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a marilith can attempt to summon
4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrou, or one nalfeshnee with a 50% chance of
success, or one glabrezu or another marilith with a 20% chance of
success. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.

### True Seeing (Su)
Mariliths continuously use this ability, as the
spell (caster level 16th).

### Skills
Mariliths have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

### Feats
In combination with its natural abilities, a marilith's
Multiweapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with all its arms at no
penalty.

### Nalfeshnee

A nalfeshnee can fly despite its small wings.

A nalfeshnee is more than 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.

#### Combat

When fulfilling their duties in the underworld, nalfeshnees usually
disdain combat as being beneath them. Given the opportunity, they
succumb to blood lust and do battle. They disable opponents with their
smite ability and slaughter them while they can't fight back.

A nalfeshnee's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Smite (Su)
Three times per day a nalfeshnee can create a nimbus of
unholy light. When the demon triggers the ability, rainbow-colored beams
play around its body. One round later they burst in a 60-foot radius.
Any creature within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be
dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of its worst fears hound it. The
creature receives its full Dexterity and shield bonuses to AC if
attacked but can take no actions. Other demons are immune to this
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*call lightning* (DC 18),
*feeblemind* (DC 20), *greater dispel magic, slow* (DC 18), *greater
teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *unholy aura* (DC 23).
Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Twice per day a nalfeshnee can attempt to
summon 1d4 vrocks, 1d4 hezrous, or one glabrezu with a 50% chance of
success, or another nalfeshnee with a 20% chance of success. This
ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.

### True Seeing (Su)
Nalfeshnees continuously use true seeing, as the
spell (caster level 14th).

### Skills
Nalfeshnees have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

In its natural form, a quasit stands about 1-1/2 feet tall and weighs
about 8 pounds.

Quasits speak Common and Abyssal.

#### Combat

Although quasits thirst for victory and power as other demons do, they
are cowards at heart. They typically attack from ambush, using their
alternate form ability and *invisibility* to get within reach, then try
to scuttle away. When retreating, they use their *cause fear* ability to
deter pursuit.

A quasit's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex,
secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes
a +2 racial bonus.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*detect good, detect magic,* and
*invisibility* (self only); 1/day---*cause fear* (as the spell, except
that its area is a 30-foot radius from the quasit, save DC 11). Caster
level 6th.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Once per week a quasit can use *commune* to ask six questions. The
ability otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).

### Alternate Form (Su)
A quasit can assume other forms at will as a
standard action. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on
itself (caster level 12th), except that a quasit does not regain hit
points for changing form, and any individual quasit can assume only one
or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include bat, monstrous
centipede, toad, and wolf. A quasit in alternate form loses its poison
attack.

A retriever specializes in recovering lost or desired objects, runaway
slaves, and enemies and bringing them back to its master. A retriever
has a body the size of an ox, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It
weighs about 6,500 pounds.

#### Combat

Retrievers attack with four claws, but their eye rays are far more
deadly.

### Eye Rays (Su)
A retriever's eyes can produce four different magical
rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray as a free
action. A particular ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. A retriever
can fire an eye ray in the same round that it makes physical attacks.
The save DC for all rays is 18. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

The four eye effects are:

*Fire:* Deals 12d6 points of fire damage to the target (Reflex half ).

*Cold:* Deals 12d6 points of cold damage to the target (Reflex half ).

*Electricity:* Deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to the target
(Reflex half ).

*Petrification:* The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or turn to
stone permanently.

### *Find Target* (Sp)
When ordered to find an item or a creature, a
retriever does so unerringly, as though guided by *discern location.*

The being giving the order must have seen (or must have an item
belonging to) the creature to be found, or must have touched the object
to be located. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a retriever must hit with
its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and grips the opponent fast in its mouth.
This is the method by which it usually "retrieves" things.

### Succubus

A succubus is 6 feet tall in its natural form and weighs about 125
pounds.

#### Combat

Succubi are not warriors. They flee combat whenever they can. If forced
to fight, they can attack with their claws, but they prefer to turn foes
against one another. Succubi use their *polymorph* ability to assume
humanoid guise, and can maintain this deception indefinitely. Their
preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is to feign friendship and
create an opportunity to be alone with one of them, whereupon the
succubus applies her life-draining kiss. Succubi are not above taking on
the role of a damsel in distress when encountered within a dungeon.

A succubus's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Energy Drain (Su)
A succubus drains energy from a mortal it lures
into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. If
the target is not willing to be kissed, the succubus must start a
grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. The succubus's kiss or
embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a
*suggestion* spell, asking the victim to accept another kiss from the
succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the
effect of the *suggestion*. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to
remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*charm monster* (DC 22), *detect
good, detect thoughts* (DC 20), *ethereal jaunt* (self plus 50 pounds of
objects only), *polymorph* (humanoid form only, no limit on duration),
*suggestion* (DC 21), *greater teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of objects
only). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a succubus can attempt to summon 1
vrock with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a
3rd-level spell.

### Tongues (Su)
A succubus has a permanent tongues ability (as the
spell, caster level 12th). Succubi usually use verbal communication with
mortals.

### Skills
Succubi have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

\*While using her *polymorph* ability, a succubus gains a +10
circumstance bonus on Disguise checks.

A vrock is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.

#### Combat

Vrocks are vicious fighters who like to fly down into the enemy and
cause as much damage as possible. They prance about in battle, taking
briefly to the air and bringing their clawed feet into play. Despite
their advantage in mobility, the vrocks' deep love of battle frequently
leads them into melee combats against heavy odds.

A vrock's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Dance of Ruin (Su)
To use this ability, a group of at least three
vrocks must join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting.

At the end of 3 rounds of dancing, a wave of crackling energy flashes
outward in a 100-foot radius. All creatures except for demons within the
radius take 20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 18 half ). Stunning,
paralyzing, or slaying one of the vrocks stops the dance. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*mirror image, telekinesis* (DC 18),
*greater teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only);
1/day---*heroism.* Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Spores (Ex)
A vrock can release masses of spores from its body once
every 3 rounds as a free action. The spores automatically deal 1d8
points of damage to all creatures adjacent to the vrock. They then
penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d4 points of damage
each round for 10 rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is covered
with a tangle of viny growths. (The vines are harmless and wither away
in 1d4 days.) A *delay poison* spell stops the spores' growth for its
duration. *Bless, neutralize poison,* or *remove disease* kills the
spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.

### Stunning Screech (Su)
Once per hour a vrock can emit a piercing
screech. All creatures except for demons within a 30-foot radius must
succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC
is Constitution-based.

### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a vrock can attempt to summon 2d10
dretches or another vrock with a 35% chance of success. This ability is
the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

### Skills
Vrocks have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Derro are afflicted by a form of racial madness, which most often
manifests as delusions of grandeur coupled with an overpowering urge to
inflict torment on other creatures. Derro are capable of holding their
murderous impulses in check for short periods of time in order to
cooperate with creatures of other races, but such arrangements rarely
last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of
recognizing that he is out of his mind.

### Combat

Derro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange
cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike savagely from hiding. They
delight in taking captives who can be tortured to death later, and favor
traps and poisons that disable without killing.

### Madness (Ex)
Derro use their Charisma modifier on Will saves
instead of their Wisdom modifier, and have immunity to *confusion* and
*insanity* effects. A derro cannot be restored to sanity by any means
short of a *miracle* or *wish* spell.

\*The racial madness of the derro provides a +6 bonus to their Charisma
scores and a --6 penalty to their Wisdom scores. A derro restored to
sanity gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.

### Poison Use (Ex)
Derro typically carry 2d4 doses of greenblood oil
or Medium monstrous spider venom, applying it to their crossbow bolts.
Derro are not at risk of poisoning themselves when handling poison.

### Sneak Attack (Ex)
Any time a derro's opponent is denied his
Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a derro flanks his opponent, he deals an
extra 1d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue's sneak
attack and subject to the same limitations.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*darkness, ghost sound;* 1/day---
*daze* (DC 13)*, sound burst* (DC 15). Caster level 3rd. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

### Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)
A derro takes 1 point of
Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight, and it
dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution points are
recovered at the rate of 1 per every 24-hour period spent underground or
otherwise sheltered from the sun.

### Skills
Derro have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently
checks.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

The dungeon-dwelling destrachan looks like some bizarre, nonintelligent
beast, but it's an incredibly evil and crafty sadist. A destrachan has a
pair of complex, three-part ears that it can adjust to be more or less
sensitive to various sounds. It is blind, yet hunts with a sense of
hearing more precise than most creatures' sight.

From its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harmonics,
producing sonic energy so powerful it can shatter a stone wall. So
skilled is a destrachan at controlling the sounds it emits that it can
choose what type of material to affect with its attack.

A destrachan is about 10 feet long from its mouth to the tip of the tail
and weighs about 4,000 pounds.

A destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If a destrachan
must communicate, it does so through action.

### Combat

A destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes
weakened by its sonic attacks. It often enters battle with surprise if
possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and
then changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh.

### Destructive Harmonics (Su)
A destrachan can blast sonic energy in a
cone up to 80 feet long. It can also use this attack to affect any
creatures or objects within a 30-foot radius. It can tune the harmonics
of this destructive power to affect different types of targets. All save
DCs are Charisma-based.

*Flesh:* Disrupting tissue and rending bone, this attack deals 4d6
points of damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).

*Nerves:* A destrachan can focus its harmonics to knock out foes rather
than slay them. This attack deals 6d6 points of nonlethal damage to all
within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).

*Material:* When using this form of harmonics, a destrachan chooses
wood, stone, metal, or glass. All objects made of that material within
the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or shatter. Objects (or
portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit points are potentially
affected by this attack.

### Blindsight (Ex)
A destrachan can use hearing to ascertain all foes
within 100 feet as a sighted creature would.

### Immunities
Destrachans have immunity to gaze attacks, visual
effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.

### Protection from Sonics (Ex)
While they can be affected by loud
noises and sonic spells (such as *ghost sound* or *silence*),
destrachans are less vulnerable to sonic attacks (+4 circumstance bonus
on all saves) because they can protect their ears. A destrachan whose
sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, and all targets are
treated as having total concealment.

### Skills
A destrachan has a +10 racial bonus on Listen checks.

## Devil

Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up
powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like
abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as
much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements;
enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real
summoned devils joining the fray.

### Devil Traits
Most devils possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

---Immunity to fire and poison.

---Resistance to acid 10 and cold 10.

---See in Darkness (Su): Some devils can see perfectly in darkness of
any kind, even that created by a *deeper darkness* spell.

---*Summon* (Sp): Some devils share the ability to summon others of
their kind (the success chance and type of devils summoned are noted in
each monster description).

---Telepathy.

Except when otherwise noted, devils speak Infernal, Celestial, and
Draconic.

A barbed devil is about 7 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds.

#### Combat

Barbed devils eagerly fight with their claws, trying to impale their
opponents. They use *hold person* to immobilize those who avoid their
hug attacks.

A barbed devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Fear (Su)
A creature hit by a barbed devil must succeed on a DC 20
Will save or be affected as though by *fear* (caster level 9th).

Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected
by that same barbed devil's fear ability for 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Impale (Ex)
A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to
a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a barbed devil must hit
with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent on its
barbed body.

### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Once per day a barbed devil can attempt to
summon 1d6 bearded devils or another barbed devil with a 35% chance of
success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

### Barbed Defense (Su)
Any creature striking a barbed devil with
handheld weapons or natural weapons takes 1d8+6 points of piercing and
slashing damage from the devil's barbs. Note that weapons with
exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in
this way.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*greater teleport* (self plus 50
pounds of objects only), *hold person* (DC 16), *major image* (DC 17),
*scorching ray* (2 rays only). 1/day---*order's wrath* (DC 18), *unholy

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every bearded devil carries a sawtoothed glaive.

A bearded devil stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 225 pounds.

#### Combat

Bearded devils are aggressive and love to fight. They revel in their
battle frenzy, spreading mayhem among their foes.

A bearded devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will--- *greater teleport* (self plus 50
pounds of objects only). Caster level 12th.

### Infernal Wound (Su)
The damage a bearded devil deals with its
glaive causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 2 additional
hit points each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists
healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16
Heal check, a *cure* spell, or a *heal* spell. However, a character
attempting to cast a *cure* spell or a *heal* spell on a creature
damaged by a bearded devil's glaive must succeed on a DC 16 caster level
check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character.

A successful Heal check automatically stops the continuing hit point
loss as well as restoring hit points. The infernal wound is a
supernatural ability of the bearded devil, not of the weapon. The check
DC is Constitution-based.

### Beard (Ex)
If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw
attacks, it automatically hits with its beard. The affected creature
takes 1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save
or be infected with a vile disease known as devil chills (incubation
period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). Damage is dealt each day until the
afflicted creature succeeds on three consecutive Fortitude saves, the
disease is cured magically, or the creature dies. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

### Battle Frenzy (Ex)
Twice per day, a bearded devil can work itself
into a battle frenzy similar to the barbarian's rage (+4 Strength, +4
Constitution, +2 morale bonus on Will saves, --2 AC penalty). The frenzy
lasts for 6 rounds, and the bearded devil suffers no ill effects
afterward.

### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Once per day a bearded devil can attempt to
summon 2d10 lemures with a 50% chance of success, or another bearded
devil with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a
3rd-level spell.

Bone devils stand about 9 feet tall and weigh about 500 pounds.

#### Combat

Bone devils hate all other creatures and attack ruthlessly. They freely
use *wall of ice* to keep the enemy divided.

A bone devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Fear Aura (Su)
Bone devils can radiate a 5-foot-radius fear aura as
a free action. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or
be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 7th). A creature
that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bone
devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save
DC is Charisma-based.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*greater teleport* (self plus 50
pounds of objects only), *dimensional anchor, fly, invisibility* (self
only), *major image* (DC 15), *wall of ice*. Caster level 12th. The save
DC is Charisma-based.

### *Summon Devil* (Sp)

2d10 lemures with a 50% chance of success, or another bone devil with a
35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level
spell.

Kytons are humanlike devils, wrapped in chains instead of clothing. A
chain devil is 6 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds, chains included.

Chain devils speak Infernal and Common.

#### Combat

A chain devil attacks by flailing away with the spiked chains that serve
as its clothing, armor, and weapons.

A chain devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Dancing Chains (Su)
A chain devil's most awesome attack is its
ability to control up to four chains within 20 feet as a standard
action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, a
chain devil can increase these chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause
them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as effectively as
the devil itself. If a chain is in another creature's possession, the
creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the chain devil's power
over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to
control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain
leaves the creature's possession. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A chain devil can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without
making Climb checks.

### Unnerving Gaze (Su)
Range 30 ft., Will DC 15 negates. A chain devil
can make its face resemble one of an opponent's departed loved ones or
bitter enemies. Those who fail their saves take a --2 penalty on attack
rolls for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Regeneration (Ex)
Chain devils take normal damage from silvered
weapons, good-aligned weapons, and spells or effects with the good
descriptor. A chain devil that loses a piece of its body regrows it in
2d6x10 minutes. Holding the severed member against the stump enables it
to reattach instantly.

### Skills
Chain devils have a +8 racial bonus on Craft checks
involving metalwork.

Unlike other devils, erinyes appear attractive to humans, resembling
very comely women or men. An erinyes stands about 6 feet tall and weighs
about 150 pounds.

Erinyes speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.

#### Combat

Erinyes prefer to engage in combat from a distance. They use *charm
monster* to distract or disorganize their opponents, then rain down
fiery arrows from above.

An erinyes's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Entangle (Ex)
Each erinyes carries a stout rope some 50 feet long
that entangles opponents of any size as an *animate rope* spell (caster
level 16th). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet with no range penalty.
Typically, an erinyes entangles a foe, lifts it into the air, and drops
it from a great height.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*greater teleport* (self plus 50
pounds of objects only), *charm monster* (DC 19), *minor image* (DC 17),
*unholy blight* (DC 19). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Once per day an erinyes can attempt to summon
2d10 lemures or 1d4 bearded devils with a 50% chance of success. This
ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

(caster level 14th).

While its appearance suggests it is incorporeal, a hellcats has a
corporeal body and can be harmed by physical attacks.

Hellcats use a natural telepathy to communicate with one another and
those they encounter. A hellcat measures about 9 feet long and weighs
about 900 pounds.

#### Combat

A hellcat can hold its own in combat thanks to sharp claws and wicked
fangs. It prefers to leap upon opponents, just as a lion does.

A hellcat's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a hellcat must hit with its
bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

### Pounce (Ex)
If a hellcat charges, it can make a full attack,
including two rake attacks.

### Rake (Ex)
Attack bonus +13 melee, damage 1d8+3.

### Invisible in Light (Ex)
A hellcat is invisible in any area lit well
enough for a human to see. In a darkened area, it shows up as a faintly
glowing outline visible up to 30 feet away (60 feet if the viewer has
low-light vision). Magical darkness smothers the glow and conceals the
outline.

### Skills
Hellcats have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Move Silently
checks.

A horned devil is 9 feet tall and weighs about 600 pounds.

#### Combat

Horned devils are bold fighters. They rarely retreat, even against
overwhelming odds. They love to fight with their spiked chains, usually
singling out the most powerful foes to stun and eliminate quickly.

A horned devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*dispel chaos* (DC 21), *dispel
good* (DC 21), *magic circle against good, greater teleport* (self plus
50 pounds of objects only); *persistent image* (DC 21)
3/day---*fireball* (DC 19), *lightning bolt* (DC 19). Caster level 15th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Fear Aura (Su)
A horned devil can radiate a 5-foot-radius fear aura
as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 23 Will
save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 15th). A
creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same
horned devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura.
The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Stun (Su)
Whenever a horned devil hits with a spiked chain attack,
the opponent must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be stunned for
1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based. This ability is a function of
the horned devil, not of the spiked chain.

### Infernal Wound (Su)
The damage a horned devil deals with its tail
attack causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 2 additional
hit points each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists
healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 24
Heal check, a *cure* spell, or a *heal* spell. However, a character
attempting to cast a *cure* spell or a *heal* spell on a creature
damaged by a horned devil's tail must succeed on a DC 24 caster level
check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A successful
Heal check automatically stops the continuing hit point loss as well as
restoring hit points. The check DC is Constitution-based.

### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Once per day a horned devil can attempt to
summon 2d10 lemures or 1d6 bearded devils with a 50% chance of success,
1d6 barbed devils with a 35% chance of success, or another horned devil
with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a
6th-level spell.

### Regeneration (Ex)
A horned devil takes normal damage from
good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects with the good
descriptor.

### Ice Devil (Gelugon)

An ice devil is about 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.

#### Combat

An ice devil prefers to fight only when doing so serves its mission, but
it never hesitates to attack when it deems a battle necessary---or
likely to end in its victory.

An ice devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Fear Aura (Su)
An ice devil can radiate a 10-foot-radius fear aura
as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 22 Will
save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 13th). A
creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same
ice devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The
save DC is Charisma-based.

### Slow (Su)
A hit from an ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing
cold. The opponent must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected
as though by a *slow* spell for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*cone of cold* (DC 20), *fly, ice
storm* (DC 19), *greater teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of objects
only), *persistent image* (DC 20), *unholy aura* (DC 23), *wall of ice*
(DC 19). Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Once per day an ice devil can attempt to summon
2d10 lemures or 1d6 bearded devils, 2d4 bone devils with a 50% chance of
success, or another ice devil with a 20% chance of success. This ability
is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

### Regeneration (Ex)
An ice devil takes normal damage from
good-aligned weapons and from spells or effects with the good
descriptor.

In its natural form, an imp stands almost 2 feet tall and weighs about 8
pounds.

#### Combat

Imps are craven, but not so timid as to pass up an opportunity for a
surprise attack using their *invisibility* and alternate form ability.
In its natural form, an imp attacks with the wicked stinger on its tail.
It quickly flies out of reach if a foe manages to strike back
effectively.

An imp's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex,
secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes
a +2 racial bonus.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*detect good, detect magic,
invisibility* (self only); 1/day---*suggestion* (DC 15). Caster level
6th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Once per week an imp can use *commune* to ask six questions. The ability
otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).

### Alternate Form (Su)
An imp can assume other forms at will as a
standard action. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on
itself (caster level 12th), except that an imp does not regain hit
points for changing form, and an individual imp can assume only one or
two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include monstrous spider,
raven, rat, and boar.

A lemure is about 5 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds.

Lemures are mindless and cannot communicate, but they are sensitive to
telepathic messages from other devils, typically obeying a devil's
mental commands.

#### Combat

Lemures surge toward anything they meet and try to claw it apart. Only a
telepathic command from other devils or the complete destruction of the
lemures can make them stop.

A lemure's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Mindless (Ex)
Immunity to mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

A pit fiend often wraps its wings around itself like a grotesque cloak,
and appears wreathed in flames.

A pit fiend is 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.

#### Combat

Pit fiends are wily and resourceful fighters, using *invisibility* to
gain the upper hand and biting at foes seemingly able to see them. They
don't hesitate to blanket an area with *fireballs*, and can call down
the wrath of an inferno with *meteor swarm.*

A pit fiend's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Constrict (Ex)
A pit fiend deals 2d8+26 points of damage with a
successful grapple check.

### Disease (Su)
A creature struck by a pit fiend's bite attack must
succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be infected with a vile disease
known as devil chills (incubation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). The
save DC is Constitution-based.

### Fear Aura (Su)
A pit fiend can radiate a 20-foot-radius fear aura
as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 27 Will
save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 18th). A
creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same
pit fiend's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The
save DC is Charisma-based.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a pit fiend must hit with
its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 27, initial damage 1d6 Con,
secondary damage death. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*blasphemy* (DC 25), *create undead,
fireball* (DC 21), *greater dispel magic, greater teleport* (self plus
50 pounds of objects only), *invisibility, magic circle against good,
mass hold monster* (DC 27), *persistent image* (DC 23), *power word
stun, unholy aura* (DC 26); 1/day---*meteor swarm* (DC 27). Caster level
18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Once per year a pit fiend can use *wish* as the spell (caster level
20th).

### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Twice per day a pit fiend can automatically
summon 2 lemures, bone devils, or bearded devils, or 1 erinyes, horned
devil, or ice devil. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level
spell.

### Regeneration (Ex)
A pit fiend takes normal damage from good-aligned
silvered weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.

#### Tactics Round-by-Round

A pit fiend typically opens combat by using its spell-like abilities,
attempting to neutralize dangerous opponents before entering melee.

*Prior to combat: Unholy aura*; activate fear aura, *summon devil*.

*Round 1:* Quickened *fireball* and *mass hold monster* if facing three
or more visible, active opponents; otherwise *power word stun* against
unarmored opponent (preferably a spellcaster).

*Round 2: Meteor swarm* against as many foes as possible, approach
worst-injured enemy.

*Round 3:* Full attack against injured enemy.

*Round 4:* Continue melee against injured enemy, or *power word stun*
against annoying spellcaster.

*Round 5:* Repeat from round 1, or *greater teleport* to safety if
endangered.

Devourers lurk on the Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane, stalking both
natives and travelers with equal sadistic glee.

A devourer is about 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.

Devourers speak Common.

### Combat

Even if it had no special abilities, a devourer would be a terrible
opponent, for its bony claws can flay enemies alive.

### Energy Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a devourer's claw attack
or *spectral hand* ability gain one negative level. The DC is 19 for the
Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Trap Essence (Su)
The devourer is named for its ability to consume
an enemy's life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee
attacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack
roll but deals no damage. The he save DC is Charisma-based. A slain
creature's essence is trapped within the devourer's ribs, and the tiny
figure takes on that victim's features. The trapped essence cannot be
raised or resurrected, but a *limited wish, miracle,* or *wish* spell
frees it, as does destroying the devourer. A devourer can hold only one
essence at a time.

The trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to use five
spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of the trapped creature.
As this energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it
evaporates completely. The trapped essence gains one negative level for
every five times the devourer uses one of its spell-like abilities. When
the essence's number of negative levels equals the creature's total Hit
Dice or level, the essence is destroyed. If an essence is freed, the
restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for each
negative level or lose that level permanently.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At the start of any encounter, the trapped
essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels (enough fuel
for thirty to seventy-five uses). Once per round, a devourer can use one
of the following abilities: *confusion* (DC 17), *control undead* (DC
20), *ghoul touch* (DC 15), *lesser planar ally, ray of enfeeblement*
(DC 14), *spectral hand, suggestion* (DC 16), *true seeing*. Caster
level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Spell Deflection (Su)
The trapped essence provides a measure of
magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at the
devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the imprisoned
essence instead: *banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair,
detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy
word, hypnosis, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the
soul,* or any form of charm or compulsion. In many cases, this
deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects
might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its
spell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.

A digester stands about 5 feet tall and is 7 feet long from snout to
tail. It weighs about 350 pounds,

### Combat

A digester is a hunting and eating machine. When it is not hungry (which
is rarely), it lies low and avoids most other creatures. When hunting,
it looks about for a likely target, then charges forth and delivers a
gout of acid. If the initial attack is insufficient to kill the prey,
the digester attacks with its hind feet until it can spray acid again.

### Acid Spray (Ex)
A digester can spray acid in a 20-foot cone,
dealing 4d8 points of damage to everything in the area. Once a digester
uses this ability, it can't use it again until 1d4 rounds later.

The creature can also produce a concentrated stream of acid that deals
8d8 points of damage to a single target within 5 feet. In either case, a
DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Skills
A digester's coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide
checks. It also has a +4 racial bonus on Jump checks.

## Dinosaur

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Bigger varieties have drab
coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have more colorful markings. Most
dinosaurs have a pebbly skin texture.

### Combat

Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The swift
carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover until they can get into
charge range and rush to the attack. Herbivores frequently overrun and
trample their opponents.

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A deinonychus is bright green along its back and flanks, with a much
lighter shade of the same color on its underside. The body has darker
spots or stripes. Its tail extends straight out behind itself, held
aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its
weight to be carried entirely by the back legs. It weighs about 600
pounds.

#### Combat

A deinonychus uses a combination of speed, grasping forearms, large
teeth, and hind legs with ripping talons. It hunts by running at prey,
leaping, and ripping with its rear talons as it claws and bites. The
talons count as one attack. A deinonychus has a relatively large brain
for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics.

### Pounce (Ex)
If a deinonychus charges, it can make a full attack.

### Skills
A deinonychus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Jump, Listen,
Spot, and Survival checks.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

Though it resides primarily in the water, an elasmosaurus only breathes
air. An elasmosaurus has a total length of some 30 feet, including a
tail half as long as its entire body, and weighs about 5,000 pounds.
Observers who see only its head or tail might easily mistake it for a
massive snake.

#### Combat

An elasmosaurus is aggressive and attacks anything it notices. The
creature is strong, fast, and highly maneuverable, able to turn quickly
and lunge at prey. When hunting, it travels with its head out of the
water, snapping down quickly to seize prey.

### Skills
\*An elasmosaurus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in
water.

Despite its enormous size and 6-ton weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift
runner. Its head is nearly 6 feet long, and its teeth are from 3 to 6
inches in length. It is slightly more than 30 feet long from nose to
tail.

#### Combat

A tyrannosaurus pursues and eats just about anything it sees. Its
tactics are simple---charge in and bite.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a tyrannosaurus must hit an
opponent of up to one size smaller with its bite attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
can try to swallow the foe the following round.

### Swallow Whole (Ex)
A tyrannosaurus can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of up to two sizes smaller by making a successful grapple
check. The swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage
and 8 points of acid damage per round from the tyrannosaurus's gizzard.
A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or
piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once
the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out.

A Huge tyrannosaurus's gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or
128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.

### Skills
A tyrannosaurus has a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

## Dire Animal

Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals.

Doppelgangers are strange beings that are able to take on the shapes of
those they encounter. In its natural form, the creature looks more or
less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed
features. The flesh is pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are
yellow with slitted pupils. A doppelganger's appearance is deceiving
even when it's in its true form. A doppelganger is hardy, with a natural
agility not in keeping with its frail appearance.

Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage
ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not
usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all
others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived.

It is natural form a doppelganger is about 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs
about 150 pounds.

### Combat

When in its natural form, a doppelganger strikes with its powerful
fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed person, it attacks
with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such cases, it uses its detect
thoughts ability to employ the same tactics and strategies as the person
it is impersonating.

### Detect Thoughts (Su)
A doppelganger can continuously use detect
thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 13 negates). It can
suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Change Shape (Su)
A doppelganger can assume the shape of any Small
or Medium humanoid. In humanoid form, the doppelganger loses its natural
attacks. A doppelganger can remain in its humanoid form until it chooses
to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but a
doppelganger reverts to its natural form when killed. A *true seeing*
spell or ability reveals its natural form.

### Skills
A doppelganger has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise
checks.

\*When using its change shape ability, a doppelganger gets an additional
+10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If it can read an opponent's
mind, it gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise
checks.

### Doppelgangers as Characters

# MONSTERS (Dr-Dw)

## Dragon, True

The known varieties of true dragons (as opposed to other creatures that
have the dragon type) fall into two broad categories: chromatic and
metallic. The chromatic dragons are black, blue, green, red, and white;
they are all evil and extremely fierce. The metallic dragons are brass,
bronze, copper, gold, and silver; they are all good, usually noble, and
highly respected by the wise.

All true dragons gain more abilities and greater power as they age.
(Other creatures that have the dragon type do not.) They range in length
from several feet upon hatching to more than 100 feet after attaining
the status of great wyrm. The size of a particular dragon varies
according to age and variety.

A dragon's metabolism operates like a highly efficient furnace and can
metabolize even inorganic material. Some dragons have developed a taste
for such fare.

Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are
covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and
gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with
large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their
lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons,
there is no such thing as enough treasure. It's pleasing to look at, and
they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards,
shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. By the time a dragon
matures to the age of great wyrm, hundreds of gems and coins may be
imbedded in its hide.

All dragons speak Draconic.

### Combat

A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, and can also use a
breath weapon and special physical attacks, depending on its size. It
prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn
down the enemy with ranged attacks. Older, more intelligent dragons are
adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous
foes first (or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).

The table below provides space and reach statistics for dragons of
various sizes, plus the natural weapons a dragon of a certain size can
employ and the damage those attacks deal.

### Bite
Bite attacks deal the indicated damage plus the dragon's
Strength bonus. A dragon also can use its bite to snatch opponents if it
has the Snatch feat.

### Claw
Claw attacks deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon's
Strength bonus (round down). The dragon also can use its claws to snatch
opponents if it has the Snatch feat. Claw attacks are secondary attacks,
requiring a --5 penalty on the attack roll. (Many dragons choose the
Multiattack feat to lessen this penalty to --2).

### Wing
The dragon can slam opponents with its wings, even when
flying. Wing attacks deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon's
Strength bonus (round down) and are treated as secondary attacks.

### Tail Slap
The dragon can slap one opponent each round with its
tail. A tail slap deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the
dragon's Strength bonus (round down) and is treated as a secondary
attack.

### Crush (Ex)
This special attack allows a flying or jumping dragon of
at least Huge size to land on opponents as a standard action, using its
whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against
opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon (though
it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger
opponents).

A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragon's
body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC
equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically
taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves
off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a
normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each
round if they don't escape.

A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's
Strength bonus (round down).

### Tail Sweep (Ex)
This special attack allows a dragon of at least
Gargantuan size to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep
affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a
Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the
dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are
affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the
dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2
times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can
attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the
dragon's breath weapon).

### Grappling
Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though their crush
attack (and Snatch feat, if they know it) use normal grapple rules. A
dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well as its
spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds on
Concentration checks.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once
a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If a
dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe
only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts
at any intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of
the dragon's choice, with an area as noted on the table below. If the
breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt
Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragon's age and
variety, and is given in each individual entry. Saves against
nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC; the kind of saving throw is
noted in the variety descriptions. The save DC against a breath weapon
is 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Con modifier.

Breath weapons come in two basic shapes, line and cone, whose areas vary
with the dragon's size.

  ------------------------------------------------- ----------------- -------------------
  Dragon Breath Weapons                                               
  Dragon Size                                       Line\* (Length)   Cone\*\* (Length)
  Tiny                                              30 ft.            15 ft.
  Small                                             40 ft.            20 ft.
  Medium                                            60 ft.            30 ft.
  Large                                             80 ft.            40 ft.
  Huge                                              100 ft.           50 ft.
  Gargantuan                                        120 ft.           60 ft.
  Colossal                                          140 ft.           70 ft.
  \*A line is always 5 feet high and 5 feet wide.                     
  \*\*A cone is as high and wide as its length.                       
  ------------------------------------------------- ----------------- -------------------

### Frightful Presence (Ex)
A young adult or older dragon can unsettle
foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically
whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures
within a radius of 30 feet x the dragon's age category are subject to
the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon. A potentially affected
creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD +
dragon's Cha modifier) remains immune to that dragon's frightful
presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become
panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for
4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.

### Spells
A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the
level indicated in its variety description, gaining bonus spells for a
high Charisma score. Some dragons can also cast spells from the cleric
list or cleric domain lists as arcane spells.

### Spell-Like Abilities
A dragon's spell-like abilities depend on its
age and variety. It gains the abilities indicated for its age plus all
previous ones. Its age category or its sorcerer caster level, whichever
is higher, is the caster level for these abilities. The save DC is 10 +
dragon's Cha modifier + spell level. All spell-like abilities are usable
once per day unless otherwise noted.

### Damage Reduction
Young adult and older dragons have damage
reduction. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Immunities (Ex)
All dragons have immunity to *sleep* and paralysis
effects. Each variety of dragon has immunity to one or two additional
forms of attack no matter what its age, as given in its description.

### Spell Resistance (Ex)
As dragons age, they become more resistant to
spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the variety
descriptions.

### Blindsense (Ex)
Dragons can pinpoint creatures within a distance of
60 feet. Opponents the dragon can't actually see still have total
concealment against the dragon.

### Keen Senses (Ex)
A dragon sees four times as well a human in
shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light. It also has
darkvision out to 120 feet.

### Skills
All dragons have skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier,
minimum 1) x (Hit Dice + 3). Most dragons purchase the following skills
at the maximum ranks possible: Listen, Search, and Spot. The remaining
skill points are generally spent on Concentration, Diplomacy, Escape
Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (any), Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device
at a cost of 1 skill point per rank. All these skills are considered
class skills for dragons. (Each dragon has other class skills as well,
as noted in the variety descriptions.)

### Feats
All dragons have one feat, plus additional feats based on Hit
Dice just like any other creature. Dragons favor Alertness, Blind-Fight,
Cleave, Flyby Attack, Hover, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power
Attack, Snatch, Weapon Focus (claw or bite), Wingover, and any metamagic
feat that is available and useful to sorcerers.

### Dragon Overland Movement

Chromatic and metallic dragons are exceedingly strong flyers and can
cover vast distances quickly. A dragon's overland flying speed is a
function of its tactical fly speed, as shown on the table below.

Dragons do not tire as quickly as other creatures when moving overland
on the ground. If a dragon attempts a hustle or a forced march, check
for nonlethal damage once every 2 hours instead of every hour.

Black dragon are sometimes known as skull dragons because of their
skeletal faces. Adding to the skeletal impression is the gradual
deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn and the
cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and does not harm the
dragon. On hatching, a black dragon's scales are thin, small, and
glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and duller,
helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.

Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes
capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and
platinum coins before killing them.

#### Combat

Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings
as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try
to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit
their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts
to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond
or bog.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A black dragon has one type of breath weapon, a
line of acid.

### Water Breathing (Ex)
A black dragon can breathe underwater
indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other
abilities while submerged.

### *Corrupt Water* (Sp)
Once per day an adult or older black dragon
can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, making it become still, foul, and
unable to support animal life. The ability spoils liquids containing
water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's
possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's
frightful presence) or become fouled. This ability is the equivalent of
a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful
presence.

### *Charm Reptiles* (Sp)
A great wyrm black dragon can use this
ability three times per day. It works as a *mass charm* spell that
affects only reptilian animals. The dragon can communicate with any
charmed reptiles as though casting a *speak with animals* spell. This
ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.

### Other Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*darkness* (juvenile or older;
radius 10 feet per age category), *insect plague* (ancient or older);
1/day---*plant growth* (old or older).

### Skills
Hide, Move Silently, and Swim are considered class skills
for black dragons.

A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep
indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing desert sands. The size of
its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become
thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with
built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is
angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their
vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert
surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of
their heads are exposed.

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the
daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of
the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store
their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they
are most fond of gems---especially sapphires.

#### Combat

Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands
until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special
abilities, such as *hallucinatory terrain*, in concert with these
tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the
target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged,
since they view retreat as cowardly.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a
line of lightning.

### *Create/Destroy Water* (Sp)
A blue dragon of any age can use this
ability three times per day. It works like the *create water* spell,
except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead of creating
it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing water.
Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must
succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful
presence) or be ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level
spell.

### Sound Imitation (Ex)
A juvenile or older blue dragon can mimic any
voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed on
a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence) to
detect the ruse.

### Other Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*ventriloquism* (adult or
older); 1/day---*hallucinatory terrain* (old or older), *veil* (ancient
or older), *mirage arcana* (great wyrm).

A wyrmling green dragon's scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade
of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow
larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green,
which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings.

#### Combat

Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on
creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing or seems formidable,
the dragon stalks the creature to determine the best time to strike and
the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the
dragon makes its presence known quickly---it enjoys

evoking terror. Sometimes the dragon elects to control a humanoid
creature through intimidation and *suggestion.* Green dragons especially
like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and
abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure
nearby.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A green dragon has one type of breath weapon, a
cone of corrosive (acid) gas.

### Water Breathing (Ex)
A green dragon can breathe underwater
indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other
abilities while submerged.

The small scales of a wyrmling red dragon are a bright glossy scarlet,
making the dragon easily spotted by predators and hunters, so it stays
underground and does not venture outside until it is more able to take
care of itself. Toward the end of young age, the scales turn a deeper
red, and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dull finish. As the
dragon grows older, the scales become large, thick, and as strong as
metal. The neck frill and wings are an ash blue or purple-gray toward
the edges, becoming darker with age. The pupils of a red dragon fade as
it ages; the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava
orbs.

#### Combat

Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an
adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to
attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time. A red
dragon lands to attack small, weak creatures with its claws and bite
rather than obliterating them with its breath weapon, so as not to
destroy any treasure they might be carrying.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A red dragon has one type of breath weapon, a
cone of fire.

### *Locate Object* (Sp)
A juvenile or older red dragon can use this
ability as the spell of the same name, once per day per age category.

### Other Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*suggestion* (old or older);
1/day---*find the path* (ancient or older), *discern location* (great
wyrm).

### Skills
Appraise, Bluff, and Jump are considered class skills for
red dragons.

The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten like mirrors. As the
dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and by very old age, scales of pale
blue and light gray are mixed in with the white.

#### Combat

White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft or
bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose their breath
weapon, then try to knock out a single opponent with a follow-up attack.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A white dragon has one type of breath weapon, a
cone of cold.

### Icewalking (Ex)
This ability works like the *spider climb* spell,
but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. It is always in effect.

### *Freezing Fog* (Sp)
An old or older white dragon can use this
ability three times per day. It is similar to a *solid fog* spell but
also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog
touches, creating the effect of a *grease* spell. The dragon is immune
to the *grease* effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability
is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.

### Other Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*fog cloud* (juvenile or older),
*gust of wind* (adult or older), *wall of ice* (ancient or older);
1/day---*control weather* (great wyrm).

### Skills
Hide, Move Silently, and Swim are considered class skills
for white dragons.

## Metallic Dragons

Metallic dragons make up the good branch of dragonkind, but they are
every bit as aggressive as their evil cousins when threatened or
challenged. They also tend to be covetous and proud.

### Brass Dragon

**Dragon (Fire)**

### Environment
Warm deserts

### Organization
Wyrmling, very young, young, juvenile, and young
adult: solitary or clutch (2--5); adult, mature adult, old, very old,

At birth, a brass dragon's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As the
dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy until they reach a
warm, burnished appearance. The grand head-plates of a brass dragon are
smooth and metallic, and it sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper
with age. Wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening
with age. As the dragon grows older, its pupils fade until the eyes
resemble molten metal orbs.

#### Combat

Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature
tries to leave without engaging in conversation, the dragon might force
compliance in a fit of pique, using *suggestion* or a dose of *sleep*
gas. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itself pinned or buried to
the neck in the sand until the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.
When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons fly out of sight,
then hide by burrowing into the sand. Older dragons spurn this ploy but
still prefer to have the advantage in combat.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a
line of fire and a cone of *sleep*. Creatures within the cone must
succeed on a Will save or fall asleep, regardless of HD, for 1d6 rounds
plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*speak with animals;*
3/day---*endure elements* (juvenile or older; radius 10 ft. x dragon's
age category); 1/day---*suggestion* (adult or older), *control winds*
(old or older), *control weather* (ancient or older).

### *Summon Djinni* (Sp)
This ability, usable by a great wyrm brass
dragon, works like a *summon monster* spell, except that it summons one
djinni. This ability is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell.

Skills: Bluff, Gather Information, and Survival are considered class
skills for brass dragons.

A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green, showing only a
hint of bronze. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens
slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop a
blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers, they
have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its eyes fade as
a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs.

#### Combat

Bronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather bribe them
(perhaps with food) or force them away magically. They use *detect
thoughts* to learn intelligent creatures' intentions.

When attacking they blind their opponents with *fog cloud* and then
charge or, if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring opponents they
conjure up a storm or use their tails to smash the vessels' hulls. If a
dragon is inclined to be lenient, ships might be merely becalmed,
fogbound, or broken-masted.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon,
a line of lightning and a cone of *repulsion* gas. Creatures within the
cone must succeed on a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move
away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the
dragon. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment effect.

### Water Breathing (Ex)
A bronze dragon can breathe underwater
indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other
abilities while submerged.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A young or older bronze dragon can assume any
animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action
three times per day. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast
on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain
hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal
or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until
it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*speak with animals;*
3/day---*create food and water* (adult or older), *fog cloud* (adult or
older), *detect thoughts* (old or older), *control water* (ancient or
older); 1/day---*control weather* (great wyrm).

At birth, a copper dragon's scales have a ruddy brown color with a
metallic tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer and
more coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by young adult age. Very old
dragons' scales pick up a green tint. A copper dragon's pupils fade with
age, and the eyes of great wyrms resemble glowing turquoise orbs.

#### Combat

A copper dragon appreciates wit and usually doesn't harm creatures that
can relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon has not heard
before. It quickly gets annoyed with anyone who doesn't laugh at its
jokes or accept its tricks with good humor. It likes to taunt and annoy
opponents into giving up or acting foolishly.

An angry copper dragon prefers to mire foes using *transmute rock to
mud*. The dragon pushes trapped opponents into the mud or snatches and
carries them aloft. A copper dragon tries to draw airborne enemies into
narrow, stony gorges where it can use its spider climb ability and
maneuver them into colliding with the walls.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A copper dragon has two types of breath weapon,
a line of acid and a cone of *slow* gas. Creatures within the cone must
succeed on a Fortitude save or be slowed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per
age category of the dragon.

### Spider Climb (Ex)
A copper dragon can climb on stone surfaces as
though using the *spider climb* spell.

### Spell-Like Abilities
2/day---*stone shape* (adult or older);
1/day---*transmute rock to mud* or *mud to rock* (old or older), *wall
of stone* (ancient or older), *move earth* (great wyrm).

On hatching, a gold dragon's scales are dark yellow with golden metallic
flecks.

The flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult stage,
the scales are completely golden. Gold dragons' faces are bewhiskered
and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until the eyes resemble
pools of molten gold.

#### Combat

Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing with
intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive to gain the
upper hand. In combat, they employ *bless* and their *luck bonus;* older
dragons use their *luck bonus* at the start of each day. They make heavy
use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are *cloudkill, delayed
blast fireball, fire shield, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep,
slow,* and *stinking cloud.*

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A gold dragon has two types of breath weapon, a
cone of fire and a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within a cone of
weakening gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of
Strength damage per age category of the dragon.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid
form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day.
This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on itself at its
caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for
changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The
dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to
assume a new one or return to its natural form.

### Water Breathing (Ex)
A gold dragon can breathe underwater
indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other
abilities while submerged (the cone of fire becomes a cone of
superheated steam underwater).

### *Luck Bonus* (Sp)
Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can
touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it
to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every
good creature in a 10-foot radius per age category of the dragon
receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and similar rolls, as for
a *stone of good luck*. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another
creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours
plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon but ends if the gem is
destroyed. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

### *Detect Gems* (Sp)
An old or older gold dragon can use this ability
three times per day. This is a divination effect similar to a *detect
magic* spell, except that it finds only gems. The dragon can scan a
60-degree arc each round: By concentrating for 1 round it knows if there
are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of concentration reveal the exact
number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their exact location, type, and
value. This ability is the equivalent of a 2ndlevel spell.

### Other Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*bless* (juvenile or older);
1/day---*geas/quest* (old or older), *sunburst* (ancient or older),
*foresight* (great wyrm).

Disguise, Heal, and Swim are considered class skills for
gold dragons.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------- ------------ ----------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- -----

A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the
dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until the
individual scales are scarcely visible.

#### Combat

Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with
highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use *fog cloud* or
*control weather* to blind or confuse opponents before attacking. When
angry, they use *reverse gravity* to fling enemies helplessly into the
air, where they can be snatched. Against flying opponents, a silver
dragon hides in clouds (creating some with *control weather* on clear
days), then jumps to the attack when it has the advantage.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A silver dragon has two types of breath weapon,
a cone of cold and a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures within a cone of
paralyzing gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6
rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A silver dragon can assume any animal or
humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times
per day. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on itself at
its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for
changing form and can only assume the form of an anirmal or humanoid.
The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to
assume a new one or return to its natural form.

### Cloudwalking (Su)
A silver dragon can tread on clouds or fog as
though on solid ground. The ability functions continuously but can be
negated or resumed at will.

### Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*fog cloud* (adult or older), *control
winds* (old or older); 2/day---*feather fall* (juvenile or older);
1/day--- *control weather* (ancient or older), *reverse gravity* (great
wyrm).

### Skills
Bluff, Disguise, and Jump are considered class skills for
silver dragons.

Its rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the
monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell resemble
light dancing on open water. The turtle's legs, tail, and head are a
lighter green, flecked with golden highlights. An adult dragon turtle
can measure from 20 to 30 feet from snout to tail, with a shell from 15
to 25 feet in diameter, and can weigh 8,000 to 32,000 pounds.

A dragonne possesses huge claws and fangs, and large eyes, usually the
color of its scales. A dragonne is about 12 feet long and weighs about
700 pounds.

Dragonnes speak Draconic.

### Combat

A dragonne's wings are useful only for short flights, carrying the
creature for 10 to 30 minutes at a time. Nevertheless, it uses its wings
effectively in battle. If opponents attempt to charge or encircle it,
the dragonne simply takes to the air and finds a more defensible
position.

### Pounce (Ex)
If a dragonne charges, it can make a full attack in the
same round.

### Roar (Su)
A dragonne can loose a devastating roar every 1d4 rounds.
All creatures except dragonnes within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 15
Will save or become fatigued. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves
become exhausted. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Skills
Dragonnes have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a dragonne is up to 348 pounds;
a medium load, 349--699 pounds, and a heavy load, 700--1,050 pounds.

A dryad's delicate features are much like a female elf 's, though her
flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves
that changes color with the seasons.

Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been
encountered in one place on rare occasions.

Dryads speak Common, Elven, and Sylvan.

### Combat

Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are
alluring---they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they
wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad uses *charm
person* or *suggestion,* attempting to gain control of the attacker(s)
who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree,
however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*entangle* (DC 13), *speak with
plants, tree shape;* 3/day--- *charm person* (DC 13), *deep slumber* (DC
15), *tree stride;* 1/day---*suggestion* (DC 15). Caster level 6th. The
save DCs are Wisdom-based.

### Tree Dependent (Su)
Each dryad is mystically bound to a single,
enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any
who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad's oak does not
radiate magic.

### Wild Empathy (Ex)
This power works like the druid's wild empathy
class feature, except that the dryad has a +6 racial bonus on the check.

Dwarves favor earth tones in their clothing and prefer simple and
functional garb. The skin can be very dark, but it is always some shade
of tan or brown. Hair color can be black, gray, or brown. Dwarves
average 4 feet tall and weigh as much as adult humans.

Dwarves speak Dwarven. Most who travel outside dwarven lands (as
traders, mercenaries, or adventurers) know the Common tongue, while
warriors in the dwarven cities usually learn Goblin to better
interrogate and spy on those evil denizens of the deep caves.

Most dwarves encountered outside their home are warriors.

### Combat

Dwarves are experts in combat, effectively using their environment and
executing well-planned group attacks. They rarely use magic in fights,
since they have few wizards or sorcerers (but dwarven clerics throw
themselves into battle as heartily as their fellow warriors). If they
have time to prepare, they may build deadfalls or other traps involving
stone. In addition to the dwarven waraxe and thrown hammer, dwarves also
use warhammers, picks, shortbows, heavy crossbows, and maces.

### Dwarf Traits (Ex)
Dwarves possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Constitution, --2 Charisma.

---Medium size.

---A dwarf 's base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at
this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a
medium or heavy load.

---Darkvision out to to 60 feet.

---Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search
checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework
traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone
surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone
but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf
who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search
check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search
skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit
depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human
can sense which way is up. Dwarves have a sixth sense about stonework,
an innate ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and
hone in their underground homes.

---Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven
urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.

---Stability: Dwarves are exceptionally stable on their feet. A dwarf
has a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or
tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying,
riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).

--- +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. \*Not reflected in
the saving throw numbers given here.

--- +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like
effects. \*Not reflected in the saving throw numbers given here.

--- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs (including halforcs)
and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).

--- +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type
(such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).

--- +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or
metal items.

--- +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome,
Goblin, Orc, Terran, Undercommon.

---Favored Class: Fighter.

The dwarf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before
racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### Subraces

The information above is for hill dwarves, the most common variety.

There are three other major dwarven subraces, which differ from hill
dwarves as follows.

#### Deep Dwarf

These dwarves live far underground and tend to be more standoffish with
non-dwarves.

Deep dwarves are the same height as other dwarves, but leaner. Their
skin sometimes has a reddish tinge, and their large eyes lack the
brightness of those of their kindred, being a washed-out blue. Their
hair color ranges from bright red to straw blond. They have little
contact with surface dwellers, relying on hill dwarves or mountain
dwarves to trade goods for them.

Deep dwarves speak Dwarven and Goblin, and occasionally Draconic or
Undercommon.

### Deep Dwarf Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the hill
dwarf traits, except where noted.

---Racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities
increases to +3.

---Racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poisons increases to +3.

---Darkvision out to 90 feet.

---Light Sensitivity: Deep dwarves are dazzled in bright sunlight or
within the radius of a *daylight* spell.

#### Duergar

Sometimes called gray dwarves, these evil beings dwell in the
underground.

Most duergar are bald (even the females), and they dress in drab
clothing that is designed to blend into stone. In their lairs they may
wear jewelry, but it is always kept dull. They war with other dwarves,
even allying with other underground creatures from time to time.

Duergar speak Dwarven and Undercommon.

### Duergar Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the hill dwarf
traits, except where noted.

--- --4 Charisma instead of --2.

---Darkvision out to 120 feet.

---Immunity to paralysis, phantasms, and poison. This trait replaces the
hill dwarf 's +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.

--- +2 racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities.

---Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day---*enlarge person* and *invisibility* as
a wizard of twice the duergar's class level (minimum caster level 3rd);
these abilities affect only the duergar and whatever it carries.

---Light Sensitivity: Duergar are dazzled in bright sunlight or within
the radius of a *daylight* spell.

--- +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

--- +1 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven, Undercommon.

Bonus Languages: Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran. This trait
replaces the hill dwarf 's automatic and bonus languages.

---Favored Class: Fighter.

---Level adjustment +1

---Unlike other dwarves, duergar do not have weapon familiarity with the
dwarven waraxe and dwarven urgrosh.

The duergar warrior presented here had the following ability scores
before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### Challenge Rating
Duergar with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal
to their character level. Duergar with levels in PC classes have a CR
equal to their character level +1.

#### Mountain Dwarf

Mountain dwarves live deeper under the mountains than hill dwarves but
generally not as far underground as deep dwarves. They average about
4-1/2 feet tall and have lighter skin and hair than hill dwarves, but
the same general appearance.

A typical giant eagle stands about 10 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to
20 feet, and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every way except
size. It weighs about 500 pounds.

Giant eagles speak Common and Auran.

### Combat

A giant eagle typically attacks from a great height, diving earthward at
tremendous speed. When it cannot dive, it uses its powerful talons and
slashing beak to strike at its target's head and eyes.

A solitary giant eagle is typically hunting or patrolling in the
vicinity of its nest and generally ignores creatures that do not appear
threatening. A mated pair attacks in concert, making repeated diving
attacks to drive away intruders, and fights to the death to defend their
nest or hatchlings.

### Evasion (Ex)
With a successful Reflex save against an attack that
allows a Reflex save for half damage, a giant eagle takes no damage.

### Skills
Giant eagles have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

### Training a Giant Eagle

Although intelligent, a giant eagle requires training before it can bear
a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant eagle must have a friendly
attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful
Diplomacy check). Training a friendly giant eagle requires six weeks of
work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

Riding a giant eagle requires an exotic saddle. A giant eagle can fight
while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or
she succeeds on a Ride check.

Giant eagle eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while
chicks are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to
rear or train a giant eagle.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a giant eagle is up to 300 pounds; a
medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

## Elemental

Elementals are incarnations of the elements that compose existence.

### Combat

Elementals have varied combat abilities and tactics, but all have the
same elemental qualities.

Air elementals speak Auran, though they rarely choose to do so.

#### Combat

Their rapid speed makes air elementals useful on vast battlefields or in
extended aerial combat.

### Air Mastery (Ex)
Airborne creatures take a --1 penalty on attack
and damage rolls against an air elemental.

### Whirlwind (Su)
The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind
once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 1 round for
every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can move through the air
or along a surface at its fly speed.

The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top,
and up to 50 feet tall, depending on the elemental's size. The elemental
controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.

The elemental's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke
attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another
creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if
it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or
through the creature's space.

Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might
take damage when caught in the whirlwind (see the table below for
details) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must
succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind
or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex
save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds,
automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that
can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The
creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The
DC for saves against the whirlwind's effects varies with the elemental's
size (see the table). The save DC is Strength based.

Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the
elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind.

Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must
succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.
Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a --4 penalty to Dexterity and a
--2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many
creatures trapped inside the whirlwind at one time as will fit inside
the whirlwind's volume.

The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes,
depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned
elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home
plane.

If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud
of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter
equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision,
including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have
concealment, while those farther away have total concealment.

Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 +
spell level) to cast a spell.

An elemental in whirlwind form cannot make slam attacks and does not
threaten the area around it.

When summoned to the Material Plane, an earth elemental consists of
whatever types of dirt, stones, precious metals, and gems it was
conjured from.

Earth elementals speak Terran but rarely choose to do so.

#### Combat

Though an earth elemental moves slowly, it is a relentless opponent. It
can travel though solid ground or stone as easily as humans walk on the
earth's surface. It cannot swim, however, and must either walk around a
body of water or go through the ground under it. An earth elemental can
move along the bottom of a body of water but prefers not to.

### Earth Mastery (Ex)
An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack
and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an
opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a --4 penalty on
attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the
statistics block.)

### Push (Ex)
An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver without
provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth
Mastery, above, also apply to the elemental's opposed Strength checks.

### Earth Glide (Ex)
An earth elemental can glide through stone, dirt,
or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims
through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does
it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A *move earth*
spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the
elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it
succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. A
body of water is an impassible barrier unless the fire elemental can
step or jump over it.

Fire elementals speak Ignan, though they rarely choose to do so.

#### Combat

A fire elemental is a fierce opponent that attacks its enemies directly
and savagely. It takes joy in burning the creatures and objects of the
Material Plane to ashes.

### Burn (Ex)
A fire elemental's slam attack deals bludgeoning damage
plus fire damage from the elemental's flaming body. Those hit by a fire
elemental's slam attack also must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on
fire. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds. The save DC varies with the
elemental's size (see the table below). A burning creature can take a
move action to put out the flame. The save DC is Constitution- based.

Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed
attacks take fire damage as though hit by the elemental's attack, and
also catch on fire unless they succeed on a Reflex save.

A water elemental can't venture more than 180 feet from the body of
water from which it was conjured.

Water elementals speak Aquan but rarely choose to do so.

#### Combat

A water elemental prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can
disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up behind its opponents.

### Water Mastery (Ex)
A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and
damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the
opponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a
--4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not
included in the statistics block.)

A water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that crosses its
path. An elemental can easily overturn small craft (5 feet of length per
Hit Die of the elemental) and stop larger vessels (10 feet long per HD).
Even large ships (20 feet long per HD) can be slowed to half speed.

### Drench (Ex)
The elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires,
exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these
are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it
touches as *dispel magic* (caster level equals elemental's HD).

### Vortex (Su)
The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool
once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and remain in that
form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In vortex form, the
elemental can move through the water or along the bottom at its swim
speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the
top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the elemental's size. The
elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.

The elemental's movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks
of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature
occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches
or enters the vortex, or if the elemental moves into or through the
creature's space.

Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might
take damage when caught in the vortex (see the table below for details)
and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex
save when it comes into contact with the vortex or take the indicated
damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up
bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking
damage each round. An affected creature is allowed a Reflex save each
round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can
leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the vortex's
effects varies with the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based.

Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the
elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in
the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration
check (DC 10 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the
whirlwind take a --4 penalty to Dexterity and a --2 penalty on attack
rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the
vortex at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume.

The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes,
depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be. A summoned elemental
always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.

If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of
debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal
to half the vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including
darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while
those farther away have total concealment.

Those caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell
level) to cast a spell.

An elemental in vortex form cannot make slam attacks and does not
threaten the area around it.

Skills: A water elemental has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Elves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100 pounds. They
live on fruits and grains, though they occasionally hunt for fresh meat.
Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that
blends well with the colors of the forest.

Elves speak Elven, and most also know Common and Sylvan.

Most elves encountered outside their homes are warriors; the information
presented here is for one of 1st level.

### Combat

Elves are cautious warriors and take time to analyze their opponents and
the location of the fight if at all possible, maximizing their advantage
by using ambushes, snipers, and camouflage. They prefer to fire from
cover and retreat before they are found, repeating this maneuver until
all of their enemies are dead.

They prefer longbows, shortbows, rapiers, and longswords. In melee,
elves are graceful and deadly, using complex maneuvers that are
beautiful to observe. Their wizards often use *sleep* spells during
combat because these won't affect other elves.

### Elf Traits (Ex)
Elves possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Dexterity, --2 Constitution.

---Medium size.

---An elf 's base land speed is 30 feet.

---Immunity to *sleep* spells and effects, and a +2 racial saving throw
bonus against enchantment spells or effects.

(Not reflected in the saving throw modifiers given here.)

---Low-light vision.

---Weapon Proficiency: Elves are automatically proficient with the
longsword, rapier, longbow, composite longbow, shortbow, and composite
shortbow.

--- +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who
merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to
a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Gnoll,
Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Sylvan.

---Favored Class: Wizard.

The elf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before
racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### Subraces

The above information describes the high elf, the most common variety.
There are five other major subraces of elf, in addition to half-elves,
who share enough elven characteristics to be included here.

#### Half-Elf

Half-elves are not truly an elf subrace, but they are often mistaken for
elves. Half-elves usually inherit a good blend of their parents'
physical characteristics.

### Half-Elf Traits (Ex)
Half-elves possess the following racial
traits.

---Medium size.

---A half-elf 's base land speed is 30 feet.

---Immunity to *sleep* spells and similar magical effects, and a +2
racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.

---Low-light vision.

--- +1 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. A half-elf does
not have the elf 's ability to notice secret doors simply by passing
near them.

--- +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks:
Half-elves get along naturally with all people. This bonus may not apply
in situations or settings where half-elves are viewed with distrust.

---Elven Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is
considered an elf. Half-elves, for example, are just as vulnerable to
special effects that affect elves as their elf ancestors are, and they
can use magic items that are only usable by elves.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages: Any (other than
secret languages, such as Druidic).

---Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf
takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing, her highest-level
class does not count.

#### Aquatic Elf

Also called sea elves, these creatures are waterbreathing cousins to
land-dwelling elves.

Aquatic elves fight underwater with tridents, spears, and nets.

### Aquatic Elf Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the high
elf traits, except where noted.

--- +2 Dexterity, --2 Intelligence. These adjustments replace the high
elf 's ability score adjustments.

---An aquatic elf has the aquatic subtype.

---An aquatic elf has a swim speed of 40 feet.

---Gills: Aquatic elves can survive out of the water for 1 hour per
point of Constitution (after that, refer to the suffocation rules).

---Superior Low-Light Vision: Aquatic elves can see four times as far as
a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of
low illumination. This trait replaces the high elf 's low-light vision.

---Favored Class: Fighter. This trait replaces the high elf 's favored
class.

#### Drow

Also known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil subterranean
offshoot.

White is the most common hair color among drow, but almost any pale
shade is possible. Drow tend to be smaller and thinner than other sorts
of elves, and their eyes are often a vivid red.

Drow usually coat their arrows with a potent venom.

### Poison (Ex)
An opponent hit by a drow's poisoned weapon must
succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. After 1 minute,
the subject must succeed on another DC 13 Fortitude save or remain
unconscious for 2d4 hours. A typical drow carries 1d4--1 doses of drow
knockout poison. Drow typically coat arrows and crossbow bolts with this
poison, but it can also be applied to a melee weapon. Note that drow
have no special ability to apply poison without risking being poisoned
themselves. Since this poison is not a magical effect, drow and other
elves are susceptible to it.

### Drow Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the high elf
traits, except where noted.

--- +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma.

---Darkvision out to 120 feet. This trait replaces the high elf 's
low-light vision.

---Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.

--- +2 racial bonus on Will saves against spells and spell-like
abilities.

---Spell-Like Abilities: Drow can use the following spell-like abilities
once per day: *dancing lights, darkness, faerie fire.* Caster level
equals the drow's class levels.

---Weapon Proficiency: A drow is automatically proficient with the hand
crossbow, the rapier, and the short sword. This trait replaces the high
elf 's weapon proficiency.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, Undercommon. Bonus Languages:
Abyssal, Aquan, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, Goblin. This trait
replaces the high elf 's automatic and bonus languages.

---Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or
a *daylight* spell) blinds drow for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they
are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.

---Favored Class: Wizard (male) or cleric (female). This trait replaces
the high elf 's favored class.

---Level adjustment +2.

The drow warrior presented here had the following ability scores before
racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Challenge Rating: Drow with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to
their character level. Drow with levels in PC classes have a CR equal to
their character level +1.

#### Gray Elf

Taller and grander in physical appearance than others of their race,
gray elves have a reputation for being aloof and arrogant (even by elven
standards). They have either silver hair and amber eyes or pale golden
hair and violet eyes. They prefer clothing of white, silver, yellow, or
gold, with cloaks of deep blue or purple.

### Gray Elf Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the high elf
traits.

--- +2 Intelligence, --2 Strength.

#### Wild Elf

Wild elvesare barbaric and tribal. Wild elves' hair color ranges from
black to light brown, lightening to silvery white with age. They dress
in simple clothing of animal skins and basic plant weaves.

### Wild Elf Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the high elf
traits, except where noted.

--- +2 Dexterity, --2 Intelligence. These adjustments replace the high
elf 's ability score adjustments.

---Favored Class: Sorcerer. This trait replaces the high elf 's favored
class.

#### Wood Elf

Their hair color ranges from yellow to a coppery red, and they are more
muscular than other elves. Their clothing is in dark shades of green and
earth tones to better blend in with their natural surroundings.

### Wood Elf Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the high elf
traits, except where noted.

--- +2 Strength, --2 Intelligence.

---Favored Class: Ranger. This trait replaces the high elf 's favored
class.

Ethereal filchers are bizarre-looking creatures with a penchant for
snatching trinkets from passersby. Their ability to move quickly between
the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane makes them spectacular
pickpockets.

Ethereal filchers do not speak.

### Combat

An ethereal filcher prowls about, using its ethereal jaunt ability to
move about unseen (and often through solid objects). Upon locating a
likely mark, it shifts to the Material Plane, attempting to catch its
victim unaware. The creature attempts to seize an item, then retreats
quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. It is not above delivering a bite to
distract its target. Once it secures a trinket, it scurries back to its
lair to admire its prize. When badly wounded, a filcher escapes rather
than continuing the fight.

Any number of simple ruses can blunt a filcher's attack.

### Detect Magic (Su)
Ethereal filchers can detect magic as the spell
(caster level 5th) at will.

### Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
An ethereal filcher can shift from the Ethereal
Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action, and shift back
again as a free action. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane for 1 round
before returning to the Material Plane. The ability is otherwise
identical with the *ethereal jaunt* spell (caster level 15th).

### Skills
Ethereal filchers have a +8 racial bonus on Sleight of Hand
checks, and a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

## Ethereal Marauder

Ethereal marauders live and hunt on the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal
marauders' coloration ranges from bright blue to deep violet. An
ethereal marauder stands about 4 feet tall, but its overall length is
about 7 feet. It weighs about 200 pounds.

Ethereal marauders speak no known languages. Survivors of their attacks
on the Material Plane claim that they emit an eerie, high whine that
varies in pitch depending on the creature's speed and health.

### Combat

Once a marauder locates prey, it shifts to the Material Plane to attack,
attempting to catch its victim flat-footed. The creature bites its
victim, then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. When badly
hurt or wounded, a marauder escapes to its home plane rather than
continuing the fight.

### Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
An ethereal marauder can shift from the
Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back
again as a move action. The ability is otherwise identical with the
*ethereal jaunt* spell (caster level 15th).

### Skills
Ethereal marauders have a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Move
Silently, and Spot checks.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

An ettercap is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.

Ettercaps speak Common.

### Combat

Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their cunning traps often ensure
that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does engage its
enemies, it attacks with its keen-edged claws and venomous bite. It
usually will not come within melee reach of any foe that is still able
to move.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial damage 1d6 Dex,
secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution based and includes
a +2 racial bonus.

### Web (Ex)
An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This is
similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with
a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to
Medium size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or
burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are
Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial
bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage
from fire.

Ettercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet
square. They usually position these to snare flying creatures but can
also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed
on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web, or they stumble into it and
become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape
or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has
something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square
section has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.

An ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can
determine the exact location of any creature touching the web.

### Skills
Ettercaps have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking),
Hide, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and
can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or
threatened.

## Ettin

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Large Giant
  Hit Dice:              10d8+20 (65 hp)
  Initiative:            +3
  Speed:                 30 ft. in hide armor (6 squares); base speed 40 ft.

  Base Attack/Grapple:   +7/+17
  Attack:                Morningstar +12 melee (2d6+6) or javelin +5 ranged (1d8+6)

  Abilities:             Str 23, Dex 8, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 11
  Skills:                Listen +10, Search +1, Spot +10
  Feats:                 Alertness, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack
  Environment:           Cold hills
  Organization:          Solitary, gang (2--4), troupe (1--2 plus 1--2 brown bears), band (3--5 plus 1--2 brown bears), or colony (3--5 plus 1--2 brown bears and 7--12 orcs or 9--16 goblins)
  Challenge Rating:      6
  Treasure:              Standard
  Alignment:             Usually chaotic evil
  Advancement:           By character class
  Level Adjustment:      +5
  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ettins, or two-headed giants, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that
stalk the night.

An ettin never bathes if it can help it, which usually leaves it so
grimy and dirty its skin resembles thick, gray hide. Adult ettins are
about 13 feet tall and weigh 5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years.

Ettins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin of Orc, Goblin,
and Giant. Creatures that can speak any of these languages must succeed
on a DC 15 Intelligence check to communicate with an ettin. Check once
for each bit of information: If the other creature speaks two of these
languages, the DC is 10, and for someone who speaks all three, the DC is
5.

### Combat

Though ettins aren't very intelligent, they are cunning fighters.

They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a straight
fight, but once the battle has started, an ettin usually fights
furiously until all enemies are dead.

### Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex)
An ettin fights with a
morningstar or javelin in each hand. Because each of its two heads
controls an arm, the ettin does not take a penalty on attack or damage
rolls for attacking with two weapons.

Skills: An ettin's two heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot,
and Search checks.

## Fiendish Creature

Fiendish creatures dwell on the lower planes, the realms of evil,
although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more
fearsome in appearance than their earthly counterparts.

### Creating a Fiendish Creature

"Fiendish" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal
aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast,
monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin of nongood alignment
(referred to thereafter as the base creature).

A fiendish creature uses all the base creature's statistics and
abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit
Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes.

### Size and Type
Animals or vermin with this template become magical
beasts, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged.
Fiendish creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the
extraplanar subtype.

### Special Attacks
A fiendish creature retains all the special attacks
of the base creature and also gains the following special attack.

***Smite Good (Su):***Once per day the creature can make a normal melee
attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD total (maximum of +20)
against a good foe.

### Special Qualities
A fiendish creature retains all the special
qualities of the base creature and also gains the following.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Damage reduction (see the table below).

---Resistance to cold and fire (see the table below).

---Spell resistance equal to the creature's HD + 5 (maximum 25).

If the base creature already has one or more of these special qualities,
use the better value.

If a fiendish creature gains damage reduction, its natural weapons are
treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Abilities
Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least
3.

### Environment
Any evil-aligned plane.

### Challenge Rating
HD 3 or less, as base creature; HD 4 to 7, as

base creature +1; HD 8 or more, as base creature +2.

### Alignment
Always evil (any).

### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +2.

  ------------ ----------------------------- ------------------

A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians
are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for
each variety.

### Combat

Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter.
If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to
their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian
also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.

### Hive Mind (Ex)
All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in
constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all
are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian
in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.

### Worker

While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as
danger) by body movements. Through the hive mind, however, they can
communicate just fine---although their intelligence still limits the
concepts that they can grasp.

A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It
weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for manual labor.

#### Combat

Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their
mandibled bite.

A formian worker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### *Cure Serious Wounds* (Sp)
Eight workers together can heal a
creature's wounds as though using the *cure serious wounds* spell
(caster level 7th). This is a full-round action for all eight workers.

### *Make Whole* (Sp)
Three workers together can repair an object as
though using the *make whole* spell (caster level 7th). This is a
fullround action for all three workers.

### Warrior

Warriors communicate through the hive mind to convey battle plans and
make reports to their commanders. They cannot speak otherwise.

A warrior is about is about 5 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet high at the
front. It weighs about 180 pounds.

#### Combat

Warriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting
all at once. Through the hive mind, they attack with coordinated and
extremely efficient tactics.

A formian warrior's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage
1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Taskmaster

These formians communicate only telepathically and derive sustenance
from the mental energies of those they dominate.

A taskmaster is about the same size as a warrior.

#### Combat

Taskmasters rely on their dominated slaves to fight for them if at all
possible. If necessary, though, they can defend themselves with claws
and a poison sting.

A formian taskmaster's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.

### Dominate Monster (Su)
A taskmaster can use a *dominate monster*
ability as the spell from a 10th-level caster (Will DC 17 negates),
although the subject may be of any kind and may be up to Large size.
Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same
taskmaster's dominate monster ability for 24 hours. A single taskmaster
can dominate up to four subjects at a time. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Dominated Creature (Ex)
A taskmaster is never encountered alone.
One dominated nonformian creature always accompanies it (choose or
determine randomly any creature of CR 4).

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary damage
1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Myrmarch

Myrmarchs are the elite of formian society. Much more than those beneath
them, these creatures are individuals, with goals, desires, and creative
thought.

A myrmarch is about is about 7 feet long and about 5-1/2 feet high at
the front. It weighs about 1,500 pounds. Its claws are capable of fine
manipulation, like human hands. Each myrmarch wears a bronze helm to
signify its position (the more elaborate the helm, the more prestigious
the position).

Myrmarchs speak Formian and Common.

#### Combat

Myrmarchs' claws are like hands and thus serve no combat purpose.

Myrmarchs occasionally employ javelins for ranged attacks, coated with
poison from their own stingers.

They fight intelligently, aiding those under them (if any such are
present) and commanding them through the hive mind. If chaotic creatures
are present, however, a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy
them.

A formian myrmarch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary damage
2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*charm monster* (DC 17),
*clairaudience/ clairvoyance, detect chaos, detect thoughts* (DC 15),
*magic circle against chaos*, *greater teleport;* 1/day---*dictum* (DC
20), *order's wrath* (DC 17). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Queen

The formian queen cannot move. With her telepathic abilities, though,
she can send instructions to and get reports from any formian within her
range.

She is about 10 feet long, perhaps 4 feet high, and weighs about 3,500
pounds.

The queen speaks Formian and Common, although she can communicate with
any creature telepathically.

#### Combat

The queen does not fight. She has no ability to move. If necessary, a
team of workers and myrmarchs (or dominated slaves) haul her enormous
bulk to where she needs to go. This sort of occurrence is very rare,
however, and most of the time the queen remains within her well-defended
chambers.

Despite her utter lack of physical activity, the queen can cast spells
and use spell-like abilities to great effect in her own defense as well
as the defense of the hive-city.

### Spells
The queen casts arcane spells as a 17th-level sorcerer.

*Typical Sorcerer Spells Known* (6/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/4, base save DC 15 +
spell level): 0---*acid splash, arcane mark, daze, detect magic, light,
mage hand, read magic, resistance, touch of fatigue;* 1st---*comprehend

*true seeing.* Caster level 17th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Telepathy (Su)

intelligent creature within 50 miles whose presence she is aware of.

A frost worn cannot burrow through stone, but can manage ice and frozen
earth. When moving through such hard materials it leaves behind a usable
tunnel about 5 feet in diameter.

A frost worm is about 40 feet long, 5 feet in diameter, and weighs about
8,000 pounds.

### Combat

Frost worms lurk under the snow, waiting for prey to come near.

They begin an attack with a trill and then set upon helpless prey with
their bite.

### Trill (Su)
A frost worm can emit a noise that forces its prey to
stand motionless. This sonic mind-affecting compulsion affects all
creatures other than frost worms within a 100-foot radius. Creatures
must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be stunned for as long as the worm
trills and for 1d4 rounds thereafter, even if they are attacked.
However, if attacked or violently shaken (a full-round action), a victim
is allowed another saving throw. Once a creature has resisted or broken
the effect, it cannot be affected again by that same frost worm's trill
for 24 hours. The effect's caster level is 14th. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Cold (Ex)
A frost worm's body generates intense cold, causing
opponents to take an extra 1d8 points of cold damage every time the
creature succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures attacking a frost worm
unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one
of their attacks hits.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
30-foot cone, once per hour, damage 15d6 cold,
Reflex DC 22 half. Opponents held motionless by the frost worm's trill
get no saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Death Throes (Ex)
When killed, a frost worm turns to ice and
shatters in an explosion that deals 12d6 points of cold damage and 8d6
points of piercing damage to everything within 100 feet (Reflex half DC
22). The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Skills
\*A frost worm, due to its coloration and its affinity for
burying itself in the snow, has a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks in its
native environment.

### Combat

Shriekers and violet fungi often work together to attract and kill prey.
When the shriekers' hellish racket attracts a curious creature, the
violet fungus tries to kill it. Both creatures enjoy the fruits of a
successful hunt.

### Shrieker

A shrieker is a stationary fungus that emits a loud noise to attract
prey or when disturbed. Shriekers live in dark, subterranean places,
often in the company of violet fungi, whose poison they are immune to.

Shriekers come in of shades of purple.

#### Combat

A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures prey to its
vicinity by emitting a loud noise.

### Shriek (Ex)
Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker
causes the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds.
The sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it.
Some creatures that live near shriekers come to learn that the fungus's
noise means there is food nearby.

### Violet Fungus

Violet fungi resemble shriekers and are often found growing among them.

A violet fungi's coloration ranges from purple overall to dull gray or
violet covered with purple spots.

#### Combat

A violet fungus flails about with its tentacles at living creatures that
come within its reach.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage
1d4 Str and 1d4 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch
indefinitely without moving and use this disguise to surprise their
foes. They require no food, water, or air, but often eat their fallen
foes out of fondness for inflicting pain.

Gargoyles speak Common and Terran.

### Combat

Gargoyles either remain still, then suddenly attack, or dive onto their
prey.

A gargoyle's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Freeze (Ex)
A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a
statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice the
gargoyle is really alive.

### Skills
Gargoyles have a +2 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot
checks. \*The Hide bonus increases by +8 when a gargoyle is concealed
against a background of stone.

### Kapoacinth

These cousins of the gargoyle have the aquatic subtype. They have a base
land speed of 40 feet and a swim speed of 60 feet (no fly speed) and are
found only in aquatic environments.

--- +4 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +8 Constitution, --4 Intelligence, --4

## Genie

Genies are humanlike beings who dwell on the elemental planes. They are
famous for their strength, guile, and skill with illusion magic.

### Combat

Genies prefer to outmaneuver and outthink their foes. They are not too
proud to flee if it means they'll live to fight another day. If trapped,
they bargain, offering treasure or favors in return for their lives and
freedom.

### *Plane Shift* (Sp)
A genie can enter any of the elemental planes,
the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the
genie and up to eight other creatures, provided they all link hands with
the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster
level 13th).

The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Elemental Plane of Air.

A djinni is about 10-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Djinn speak Auran, Celestial, Common, and Ignan.

#### Combat

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers
and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat
usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow.

### Air Mastery (Ex)
Airborne creatures take a --1 penalty on attack
and damage rolls against a djinni.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*invisibility* (self only); 1/day---
*create food and water, create wine* (as *create water,* but wine
instead), *major creation* (created vegetable matter is permanent),
*persistent image* (DC 17), *wind walk.* Once per day, a djinni can
assume *gaseous form* (as the spell) for up to 1 hour. Caster level
20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Whirlwind (Su)
A djinni can transform itself into a whirlwind once
every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 7 rounds. In this
form, it can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.

The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top
and up to 50 feet tall. The djinni controls the exact height, but it
must be at least 10 feet.

A djinni's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of
opportunity, even if the djinni enters the space another creature
occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it
touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the djinni moves into or through
the creature's space.

Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the djinni might take
damage when caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air. An
affected creature must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save when it comes into
contact with the whirlwind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must also
succeed on a second DC 20 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held
suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 1d8 points of
damage each round. A creature with a fly speed is allowed a DC 20 Reflex
save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage
but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based
and includes a +3 racial adjustment.

Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the
djinni carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the
whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration
check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the
whirlwind take a --4 penalty to Dexterity and a --2 penalty on attack
rolls. The djinni can have only as many trapped inside a whirlwind at
one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume.

The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes,
depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be.

If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud
of debris. This cloud is centered on the djinni and has a diameter equal
to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including
darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while
those farther away have total concealment.

Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 +
spell level) to cast a spell.

A djinni in whirlwind form cannot make melee attacks and does not
threaten the area around it.

#### Noble Djinn

Some djinn (1% of the total population) are noble. A noble djinni can
grant three *wishes* to any being (nongenies only) who captures it.
Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the third
*wish,* are free of their servitude. Noble djinn are as strong as efreet
(see below), with 10 Hit Dice.

### Efreeti

                         Large Outsider (Extraplanar, Fire)

The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Elemental Plane of
Fire.

An efreeti stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds.

Efreet speak Auran, Common, Ignan, and Infernal.

#### Combat

Efreet love to mislead, befuddle, and confuse their foes. They do so for
enjoyment as well as a battle tactic.

### *Change Size* (Sp)
Twice per day, an efreeti can magically change a
creature's size. This works just like an *enlarge person* or *reduce
person* spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except that
the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a
2nd-level spell.

### Heat (Ex)
An efreeti's red-hot body deals 1d6 points of extra fire
damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains a hold
when grappling.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*detect magic, produce flame,
pyrotechnics* (DC 14), *scorching ray* (1 ray only);
3/day---*invisibility, wall of fire* (DC 16); 1/day---grant up to three
*wishes* (to nongenies only), *gaseous form, permanent image* (DC 18),
*polymorph* (self only). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed
out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on
the Material Plane.

Jann speak Common, one elemental language (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or
Terran) and one alignment language (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal).

#### Combat

Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to
insult or injury. If they meet a foe they cannot defeat in a standup
fight, they use flight and *invisibility* to regroup and maneuver to a
more advantageous position.

### *Change Size* (Sp)
Twice per day, a janni can magically change a
creature's size. This works just like an *enlarge person* or *reduce
person* spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that
the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a
2nd-level spell.

### Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*invisibility* (self only), *speak
with animals.* Caster level 12th. Once per day a janni can *create food
and water* (caster level 7th) and can use *ethereal jaunt* (caster level
12th) for 1 hour. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Elemental Endurance (Ex)
Jann can survive on the Elemental Planes
of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to return to
the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1
point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until
it dies or returns to the Material Plane.

#### Jann as Characters

Janni characters possess the following racial traits.

--- +6 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +4
Wisdom, +2 Charisma.

---Medium size.

---A janni's base land speed is 30 feet. It also has a fly speed of 20
feet (perfect).

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Racial Hit Dice: A janni begins with six levels of outsider, which
provide 6d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +6, and base saving throw
bonuses of Fort +5, Ref +5, and Will +5.

---Racial Skills: A janni's outsider levels give it skill points equal
to 9 x (8 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Appraise, Concentration,
Craft (any), Escape Artist, Listen, Move Silently, Ride, Sense Motive,
and Spot.

---Racial Feats: A janni's outsider levels give it three feats. A janni
receives Improved Initiative as a bonus feat.

--- +1 natural armor bonus.

resistance to fire 10, telepathy. 100 ft.

A ghaele can take the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch colors, 5
feet in diameter. A ghaele is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 170
pounds.

Ghaeles speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate
with almost any creature, thanks to their *tongues* ability.

### Combat

Ghaeles who enter combat prefer direct confrontation and damaging
attacks to more subtle or insidious methods. They usually fight in their
humanoid form, wielding incandescent *+4 holy greatswords.* If a ghaele
desires mobility, it assumes its globe form and blasts the enemy with
light rays.

A ghaele's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*aid, charm monster* (DC 17), *color
spray* (DC 14), *comprehend languages, continual flame, cure light
wounds* (DC 14), *dancing lights, detect evil, detect thoughts* (DC 15),
*disguise self, dispel magic, hold monster* (DC 18), *greater
invisibility* (self only), *major image* (DC 16), *see invisibility,
greater teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only); 1/day---*chain
lightning* (DC 19), *prismatic spray* (DC 20), *wall of force.* Caster
level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Spells
Ghaeles in humanoid form can cast divine spells as
14th-level clerics. A ghaele has access to two of the following domains:
Air, Animal, Chaos, Good, or Plant (plus any others from its deity). The
save DCs are Wisdom-based.

*Typical Cleric Spells Prepared* (6/7/7/6/5/4/4/3; save DC 13 + spell
level): 0---*cure minor wounds, detect magic, guidance, light,
resistance, virtue;* 1st---*bless, calm animals\*, command, divine
favor, obscuring mist, sanctuary, shield of faith;* 2nd---*aid, align
weapon, bear 's endurance, hold animal\*, lesser restoration, remove
paralysis, zone of truth;* 3rd---*daylight, gaseous form\*, prayer,
remove curse, searing light, water breathing;* 4th---*death ward,
dismissal, divine power, restoration, summon nature's ally IV
(animal)\*;* 5th---*control winds\*, flame strike, raise dead, true
seeing;* 6th---*banishment, blade barrier, chain lightning\*, heal;*
7th---*animal shapes\*, holy word, summon monster VII.*

\*Domain spell. Domains: Air and Animal.

### Gaze (Su)
In humanoid form---slay evil creatures of 5 or less HD,
range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds, the
creature is affected as though by a *fear* spell for 2d10 rounds.
Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed
on a DC 18 Will save or suffer the *fear* effect. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Light Ray (Ex)
A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a
range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and
globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use
its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities,
make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use
its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells
or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and the ghaele
has no Strength score while in that form.

A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A
change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any
particular form when killed. A *true seeing* spell or ability, however,
reveals both forms simultaneously.

### Protective Aura (Su)
Against attacks made or effects created by
evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a
+4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the
ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a *magic circle against evil* effect
and a *lesser globe of invulnerability,* both with a radius of 20 feet
(caster level equals ghaele's HD). (The defensive benefits from the
circle are not included in a ghaele's statistics block.)

### Tongues (Su)
Ghaeles can speak with any creature that has a
language, as though using a *tongues* spell (caster level 14th). This
ability is always active.

## Ghost

Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one
reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves.

A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases
the spiritual form is somewhat altered.

### Creating a Ghost

"Ghost" is an acquired template that can be added to any aberration,
animal, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or
plant. The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must
have a Charisma score of at least 6.

A ghost uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities
except as noted here.

### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to undead. Do not
recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It
gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged.

### Hit Dice
All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.

### Speed
Ghosts have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base creature
has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability.

### Armor Class
Natural armor is the same as the base creature's but
applies only to ethereal encounters. When the ghost manifests (see
below), its natural armor bonus is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus
equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.

### Attack
A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature,
although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that
are not ethereal.

### Full Attack
A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature,
although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that
are not ethereal.

### Damage
Against ethereal creatures, a ghost uses the base creature's
damage values. Against nonethereal creatures, the ghost usually cannot
deal physical damage at all but can use its special attacks, if any,
when it manifests (see below).

### Special Attacks
A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base
creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect
nonethereal creatures. The ghost also gains a manifestation ability plus
one to three other special attacks as described below. The save DC
against a special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost's HD + ghost's Cha
modifier unless otherwise noted.

*Corrupting Gaze (Su):* A ghost can blast living beings with a glance,
at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost's gaze must
succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points
of Charisma damage.

*Corrupting Touch (Su):* A ghost that hits a living target with its
incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal
opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls.
Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack
rolls only.

*Draining Touch (Su):* A ghost that hits a living target with its
incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it
selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of
damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength
modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds
its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.

*Frightful Moan (Su):* A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard
action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a
Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic
mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against
the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours.

*Horrific Appearance (Su):* Any living creature within 60 feet that
views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4
points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4
points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves
against this effect cannot be affected by the same ghost's horrific
appearance for 24 hours.

*Malevolence (Su):* Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body
with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a
*magic jar* spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever
is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this
ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the
target's space; moving into the target's space to use the malevolence
ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist
the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost's Cha modifier). A
creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's
malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space.
If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target's body.

*Manifestation (Su):* Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on
the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be
affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it
partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on
the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other
incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to
ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass
through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A
manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost can strike
with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly
Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal
Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked
by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The
ghost's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane,
but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.

When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal
Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they
work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost
manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect
targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch.
A manifested ghost's touch spells don't work on nonethereal targets.

A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane.
It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes.

*Telekinesis (Su):* A ghost can use *telekinesis* as a standard action
(caster level 12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher).
When a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it
again.

### Special Qualities
A ghost has all the special qualities of the base
creature as well as those described below.

*Rejuvenation (Su):* In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost
through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will often restore itself
in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary
solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old
haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's HD) against DC 16.
As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine
the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from
resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may
require a good deal of research.

*Turn Resistance (Ex):* A ghost has +4 turn resistance.

### Abilities
Same as the base creature, except that the ghost has no
Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases by +4.

### Skills
Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Search, and
Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.

### Environment
Any, often as base creature.

### Organization
Solitary, gang (2--4), or mob (7--12).

### Challenge Rating
Same as the base creature +2.

### Treasure
None.

### Alignment
Any.

### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +5.

#### Ghostly Equipment

When a ghost forms, all its equipment and carried items usually become
ethereal along with it. In addition, the ghost retains 2d4 items that it
particularly valued in life (provided they are not in another creature's
possession). The equipment works normally on the Ethereal Plane but
passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1
or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures when
the ghost manifests, but any such attack has a 50% chance to fail unless
the weapon is a ghost touch weapon (just as magic weapons can fail to
harm the ghost).

The original material items remain behind, just as the ghost's physical
remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the ethereal copy
fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing
to return the item to its original resting place.

Ghouls speak the languages they spoke in life (usually Common).

### Combat

Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever possible. They strike from
behind tombstones and burst from shallow graves.

### Ghoul Fever (Su)
Disease---bite, Fortitude DC 12, incubation period
1 day, damage 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex. The save DC is Charisma-based.

An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the
next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of
any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves
like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more
rises as a ghast, not a ghoul.

### Paralysis (Ex)
Those hit by a ghoul's bite or claw attack must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds.
Elves have immunity to this paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Lacedon

These cousins of the ghoul have the aquatic subtype. They lurk near
hidden reefs or other places where ships are likely to meet their end.
They have a base land speed of 30 feet and a swim speed of 30 feet and
are found only in aquatic environments.

### Ghast

Although these creatures look just like their lesser kin, they are far
more deadly and cunning.

#### Combat

### Ghoul Fever (Su)
Disease---bite, Fortitude DC 15, incubation period
1 day, damage 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Paralysis (Ex)
Those hit by a ghast's bite or claw attack must
succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Even
elves can be affected by this paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Stench (Ex)
The stink of death and corruption surrounding these
creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures

within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for
1d6+4 minutes. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
again by the same ghast's stench for 24 hours. A *delay poison* or
*neutralize poison* spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.
Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures
resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.
The save DC is Charisma-based.

## Giant

All giants speak Giant. Those with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher
also speak Common.

### Combat

Giants relish melee combat. They favor massive two-handed weapons and
wield them with impressive skill. They have enough cunning to soften up
a foe with ranged attacks first, if they can. A giant's favorite ranged
weapon is a big rock.

### Rock Throwing (Ex)
Adult giants are accomplished rock throwers and
receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A giant
of at least Large size can hurl rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each
(Small objects) up to five range increments. The size of the range
increment varies with the giant's variety. A Huge giant can hurl rocks
of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium objects).

### Rock Catching (Ex)
A giant of at least Large size can catch Small,
Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).

Once per round, a giant that would normally be hit by a rock can make a
Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock,
20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile provides
a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The
giant must be ready for and aware of the attack in order to make a rock
catching attempt.

Cloud giants' skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky blue.
Their hair is silvery white or brass, and their eyes are iridescent
blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000 pounds.
Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be
400 years old.

Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To
many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes and the finer
the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music,
and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite).

#### Combat

Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed
battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their
opponents. A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them
with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with
spells.

### Rock Throwing (Ex)
The range increment is 140 feet for a cloud
giant's thrown rocks.

### Oversized Weapon (Ex)
A cloud giant wields a great, two-handed
morningstar (big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without penalty.

### Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*levitate* (self plus 2,000 pounds),
*obscuring mist*; 1/day---*fog cloud*. Caster level 15th.

### Cloud Giant Characters

Most cloud giant groups include a sorcerer or a cleric.

Good-aligned clerics have access to two of the following domains: Good,
Healing, Strength, or Sun. Evil-aligned clerics have access to two of
the following domains: Death, Evil, or Trickery.

Some fire giants have bright orange hair.. An adult male is 12 feet
tall, has a chest that measures 9 feet

around, and weighs about 7,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and
lighter. Fire giants can live to be 350 years old.

Fire giants wear sturdy cloth or leather garments colored red, orange,
yellow, or black. Warriors wear helmets and half-plate armor of
blackened steel.

#### Combat

Fire giants heat their rocks in a nearby fire, geyser, or lava pools, so
that they deal extra fire damage. They favor magic flaming swords in
melee (when they can get them). They are also fond of grabbing smaller
opponents and tossing them somewhere very hot.

### Rock Throwing (Ex)
The range increment is 120 feet for a fire
giant's thrown rocks.

#### Fire Giant Characters

Most groups of fire giants include clerics. A fire giant cleric has
access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Trickery, or War
(most choose Trickery or War, some choose both).

A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes
usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts,
along with any jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors add chain shirts
and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers.

An adult male is about 15 feet tall and weighs about 2,800 pounds.
Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical with
males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.

#### Combat

Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until
they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with
their enormous battleaxes.

A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at
the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty
reaching them.

### Rock Throwing (Ex)
The range increment is 120 feet for a frost
giant's thrown rocks.

### Frost Giant Jarl

A frost giant leader is often a barbarian, cleric, fighter, or sorcerer,
but some of the most evil and ruthless frost giants become blackguards.

The frost giant jarl described here has all the qualities and abilities
of a typical frost giant, as well as other abilities (see the statistics
block) from being a blackguard. Details on some of these abilities
follow.

### Aura of Despair (Su)
This jarl radiates a malign aura that causes
enemies within 10 feet of him to take a --2 penalty on all saving
throws.

### Aura of Evil (Ex)
This jarl radiates a strong aura of evil (see the
*detect evil* spell) as an 8th-level cleric of an evil deity.

### Command Undead (Su)
This jarl can command and rebuke undead as a
6th-level cleric.

### Dark Blessing (Su)
This jarl applies his Charisma modifier as a
bonus on all saving throws.

### *Detect Good* (Sp)
At will, this jarl can use *detect good* as a
spell-like ability, duplicating the effect of the *detect good* spell.

### Poison Use
Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison and never
risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.

### Smite Good (Su)
Twice per day, this jarl may attempt to smite good
with one normal melee attack. He adds his +4 Charisma modifier to his
attack roll and deals 8 points of extra damage (1 per blackguard level)
if the attack hits. If he accidentally smites a creature that is not
good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day.

*Typical Blackguard Spells Prepared* (3/1; save DC 11 + spell level):
1st---*cause fear, doom, magic weapon;* 2nd---*bull's strength.*

*Possessions: +2 frost greataxe, +2 full plate armor, cloak of Charisma
+2, ring of minor energy resistance (fire),* 2 doses of bloodroot
poison. (Benefits of these items are included in the statistics block.)

### Frost Giant Characters

Many groups of frost giants include clerics. A frost giant cleric has
access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, or War
(most choose Destruction or War, some choose both).

Skin color among hill giants ranges from light tan to deep ruddy brown.
Their hair is brown or black, with eyes the same color. Hill giants wear
layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on. They seldom wash
or repair their garments, preferring to simply add more hides as their
old ones wear out.

Adults are about 10-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 1,100 pounds. Hill
giants can live to be 200 years old.

#### Combat

Hill giants prefer to fight from high, rocky outcroppings, where they

their massive clubs.

Very rarely, storm giants have violet skin. Violet-skinned storm giants
have deep violet or blue-black hair with silvery gray or purple eyes.
Adults are about 21 feet tall and weigh about 12,000 pounds. Storm
giants can live to be 600 years old. Storm giants' garb is usually a
short, loose tunic belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and a
headband. They wear a few pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry,
anklets (favored by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most
common. They live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing
about the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land or
gathering food.

#### Combat

Storm giants use weapons and spell-like abilities instead of throwing
rocks. Their composite longbows have a range increment of 180 feet.

### Spell-Like Abilities
1/day---*call lightning* (DC 15), *chain
lightning* (DC 18). Caster level 15th. 2/day---*control weather*,
*levitate.* Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Freedom of Movement (Su)
Storm giants have a continuous freedom of
movement ability as the spell (caster level 20th). The effect can be
dispelled, but the storm giant can create it again on its next turn as a
free action.

### Water Breathing (Ex)
Storm giants can breathe underwater
indefinitely and can freely use their spell-like abilities while
submerged.

### Skills
A storm giant has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
\*Storm giants ignore all weight penalties for gear carried when
swimming.

#### Storm Giant Characters

About 20% of adult storm giants are sorcerers or clerics. A storm giant
cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Good,
Protection, or War.

A gibbering mouther is a horrible creature seemingly drawn from a
lunatic's nightmares. Although not evil, it thirsts after bodily fluids
and seems to prefer the blood of intelligent creatures.

A gibbering mouther is about 3 feet across and 3 to 4 feet high. It
weighs about 200 pounds.

Gibbering mouthers can speak Common, but seldom say anything other than
gibberish.

### Combat

A gibbering mouther attacks by shooting out strings of protoplasmic
flesh, each ending in one or more eyes and a mouth that bites at the
enemy. A mouther can send out a total of six such members in any round.

### Gibbering (Su)
As soon as a mouther spots something edible, it
begins a constant gibbering as a free action. All creatures (other than
mouthers) within a 60-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or
be affected as though by a *confusion* spell for 1d2 rounds. This is a
sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully
saves cannot be affected by the same gibbering mouther's gibbering for
24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Spittle (Ex)
As a free action every round, a gibbering mouther
fires a stream of spittle at one opponent within 30 feet. The mouther
makes a ranged touch attack; if it hits, it deals 1d4 points of acid
damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be
blinded for 1d4 rounds. Eyeless creatures are immune to the blinding
effect, but are still subject to the acid damage. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a gibbering mouther must
hit with a bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Blood Drain (Ex)
On a successful grapple check after grabbing, that
mouth attaches to the opponent. It automatically deals bite damage and
drains blood, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round. A mouth
can be ripped off (dealing 1 point of damage) with a DC 12 Strength
check or severed by a successful sunder attempt (the mouth has 2 hit
points).

A severed mouth continues to bite and drain blood for 1d4 rounds after
such an attack. A creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 is killed.

### Engulf (Ex)
A gibbering mouther can try to engulf a Medium or
smaller opponent grabbed by three or more mouths.

The opponent must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or fall and be
engulfed. In the next round, the mouther makes twelve bite attacks
instead of six (each with a +4 attack bonus). An engulfed creature
cannot attack the mouther from within. The previously attached mouths
are now free to attack others. The save DC is Strength-based and
includes a +2 racial bonus.

### Ground Manipulation (Su)
At will, as a standard action, a gibbering
mouther can cause stone and earth in all adjacent squares to become a
morass akin to quicksand. Softening earth, sand, or the like takes 1
round, while stone takes 2 rounds. Anyone other than the mouther in that
area must take a move-equivalent action to avoid becoming mired (treat
as being pinned).

### Amorphous (Ex)
A gibbering mouther is not subject to critical hits.
It cannot be flanked.

### Skills
Thanks to their multiple eyes, gibbering mouthers have a +4
racial bonus on Spot checks.

A gibbering mouther has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It always can choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Girallons are savage, magical cousins of the gorilla. When moving on the
ground, a girallon walks on its legs and lower arms. An adult girallon
is about 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white
fur. It weighs about 800 pounds.

### Combat

A solitary girallon usually conceals itself in the branches of a tree or
under a pile of leaves and brush, with only its nose showing. When it
spots or scents prey, it charges to the attack. A girallon picks up prey
that is small enough to carry and withdraws, often vanishing into the
trees before the victim's companions can do anything to retaliate.
Against larger foes, a girallon seeks to tear a single opponent to bits
as quickly as it can.

### Rend (Ex)
A girallon that hits with two or more claw attacks
latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack
automatically deals an extra 2d4+12 points of damage.

### Skills
A girallon has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose tribes.
Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. A gnoll is a
nocturnal carnivore, preferring intelligent creatures for food because
they scream more. A gnoll is about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 300
pounds. Gnolls speak Gnoll.

### Combat

Gnolls like to attack when they have the advantage of numbers, using
horde tactics and their physical strength to overwhelm and knock down
their opponents. They show little discipline when fighting unless they
have a strong leader; at such times, they can maintain ranks and fight
as a unit. While they do not usually prepare traps, they do use ambushes
and try to attack from a flanking position. Because of its shield, a
gnoll's modifier on Hide checks (untrained) is --2, which means gnolls
always take special care to seek favorable conditions when laying
ambushes (such as darkness, cover, or some other form of advantageous
terrain).

### Gnolls as Characters

Gnoll characters possess the following racial traits.

---Strength +4, Constitution +2, Intelligence --2, Charisma --2.

---Size Medium.

---A gnoll's base land speed is 30 feet.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Racial Hit Dice: A gnoll begins with two levels of humanoid, which
provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saving throw
bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0.

---Racial Skills: A gnoll's humanoid levels give it skill points equal
to 5 x (2 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Listen and Spot.

---Racial Feats: A gnoll's humanoid levels give it one feat.

--- +1 natural armor bonus.

---Automatic Languages: Gnoll. Bonus Languages: Common, Draconic, Elven,
Goblin, Orc.

---Favored Class: Ranger.

---Level adjustment +1.

Gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin
color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their
eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome males prefer short, carefully
trimmed beards. Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though
they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry.
Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years,
though some can live almost 500 years.

Gnomes speak their own language, Gnome. Most gnomes who travel outside
gnome lands (as traders, tinkers, or adventurers) know Common, while
warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin.

Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the information
in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.

### Combat

Gnomes prefer misdirection and deception over direct confrontation.

They would rather befuddle or embarrass foes (other than goblinoids or
kobolds) than kill them.

Gnomes make heavy use of illusion magic and carefully prepared ambushes
and traps whenever they can.

### Gnome Traits (Ex)
Gnomes possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Constitution, --2 Strength.

---Small size. +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4
bonus on Hide checks, --4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting and
carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters.

---A gnome's base land speed is 20 feet.

---Low-light vision.

---Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial
weapons rather than exotic weapons.

--- +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.

---Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion
spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar
effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.

--- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids
(including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).

--- +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type
(such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).

--- +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.

--- +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Gnome. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc.

---Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day---*speak with animals* (burrowing mammal
only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of at least 10
also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day---*dancing lights,
ghost sound, prestidigitation.* Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome's
Cha modifier + spell level.

---Favored Class: Bard.

The gnome warrior presented here had the following ability scores before
racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### Subraces

The information above is for rock gnomes, the most common variety.

There are two other major gnome subraces, which differ from rock gnomes
as follows.

#### Svirfneblin

Also called deep gnomes, svirfneblin are said to dwell in great cities
deep underground.

A svirfneblin has wiry, rock-colored skin usually medium brown to
brownish gray. Only males are bald; females have stringy gray hair. The
average svirfneblin lifespan is 250 years.

Svirfneblin speak Gnome, Common, and Undercommon.

### Svirfneblin Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the rock
gnome traits, except where noted.

--- --2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, --4 Charisma. These
adjustments replace the rock gnome's ability score adjustments.

---Stonecunning: This ability grants deep gnomes a +2 racial bonus on
Search checks to notice unusual stonework. A deep gnome who merely comes
within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as though
actively searching, and can use the Search skill to find stonework traps
as a rogue can. A svirfneblin can also intuit depth, sensing the
approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can sense which
way is up.

---Darkvision out to 120 feet and low-light vision.

---Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.

--- +2 racial bonus on all saving throws (figured into the statistics
for the character presented here). This trait replaces the rock gnome's
racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.

---Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion
spells cast by svirfneblin. This adjustment stacks with those from
similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.

--- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.

--- +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against all creatures (figured into
the statistics for the character presented here). This trait replaces
the rock gnome's dodge bonus against giants.

---Automatic Languages: Undercommon, Gnome, Common. Bonus Languages:
Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran. This trait replaces the rock
gnome's automatic and bonus languages.

---Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day---*blindness/deafness* (typical save DC
13), *blur, disguise self*. Caster level equals the svirfneblin's class
levels. The save DC is Charisma-based and include a +4 racial modifier.
This trait replaces the rock gnome's spell-like abilities.

---Nondetection (Su): A svirfneblin has a continuous nondetection
ability as the spell (caster level equal to class levels).

--- +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) and Listen checks.

--- +2 racial bonus on Hide checks, which improves to +4 underground.

---Favored Class: Rogue.

---Level adjustment +3.

The svirfneblin warrior presented here had the following ability scores
before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Challenge Rating: Svirfneblin with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal
to their character level. Svirfneblin with levels in PC classes have a
CR equal to their character level +1.

#### Forest Gnome

They are the smallest of all the gnomes, averaging 2 to 2-1/2 feet in
height, but look just like regular gnomes except with bark-colored or
gray-green skin, and eyes that can be brown or green as well as blue. A
very long-lived people, forest gnomes have an average life expectancy of
500 years.

### Forest Gnome Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the rock
gnome traits, except where noted.

---*Pass without Trace* (Su): A forest gnome has the innate ability to
use *pass without trace* (self only, as a free action) as the spell cast
by a druid of the forest gnome's class levels.

--- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds, goblinoids, orcs,
and reptilian humanoids.

---Automatic Languages: Gnome, Elven, Sylvan, and a simple language that
enables them to communicate on a very basic level with forest animals
(this replaces the rock gnome's *speak with animals* ability). Bonus
Languages: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, Goblin, Orc. This trait
replaces the rock gnome's automatic and bonus languages.

--- +4 racial bonus on Hide checks, which improves to +8 in a wooded
area.

  Challenge Rating:      1/3

  Advancement:           By character class

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A goblin stands 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Its eyes
are usually dull and glazed, varying in color from red to yellow. A
goblin's skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a
deep red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same
color. Goblins wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward drab,
soiled-looking colors. Goblins speak Goblin; those with Intelligence
scores of 12 or higher also speak Common.

Most goblins encountered outside their homes are warriors; the
information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.

### Combat

Being bullied by bigger, stronger creatures has taught goblins to
exploit what few advantages they have: sheer numbers and malicious
ingenuity. The concept of a fair fight is meaningless in their society.
They favor ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge
they can devise.

Goblins have a poor grasp of strategy and are cowardly by nature,
tending to flee the field if a battle turns against them. With proper
supervision, though, they can implement reasonably complex plans, and in
such circumstances their numbers can be a deadly advantage.

### Skills
Goblins have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently and Ride
checks. Goblin cavalry (mounted on worgs) usually select the Mounted
Combat feat in place of the Alertness feat, which reduces their Spot and
Listen check modifiers from +3 to +1.

### Challenge Rating
Goblins with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal
to their character level --2.

### Goblins as Characters

Goblin characters possess the following racial traits.

--- --2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, --2 Charisma.

---Small size: +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4
bonus on Hide checks, --4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting and
carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters.

---A goblin's base land speed is 30 feet.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

--- +4 racial bonus on Move Silently and Ride checks.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Goblin. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Orc.

---Favored Class: Rogue.

The goblin warrior presented here had the following ability scores
before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

## Golem

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one
involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces.

The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental Plane of
Earth. The process of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to
the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.

### Combat

Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well. Being
mindless, they do nothing without orders from their creators. They
follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or
tactics. They are emotionless in combat and cannot be provoked.

A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can
see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its
last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it
returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to
govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem's creator can order
the golem to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn
place the golem under someone else's control, and so on), but the
golem's creator can always resume control over his creation by
commanding the golem to obey him alone.

### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
Golems have immunity to most magical and
supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted.

### Construction

The cost to create given for each golem includes the cost of the
physical body and all the materials and spell components that are
consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. Creating a golem is
essentially similar to creating any sort of magic item. However, a
golem's body includes costly material components that may require some
extra preparation. The golem's creator can assemble the body or hire
someone else to do the job. The builder must have the appropriate skill,
which varies with the golem variety.

Completing the golem's creation drains the appropriate XP from the
creator and requires casting any spells on the final day.

The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from
outside sources, such as scrolls.

The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a magic item
(caster level, prerequisite feats and spells, market price, cost to
create) are given in summary form at the end of each golem's
description.

*Note:* The market price of an advanced golem (a golem with more Hit
Dice than the typical golem described in each entry) is increased by
5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die, and increased by an additional
50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. The XP cost for creating an
advanced golem is equal to 1/25 the advanced golem's market price minus
the cost of the special materials required.

This golem has a humanoid body made from clay. A clay golem wears no
clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips.

A clay golem golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise. It walks and
moves with a slow, clumsy gait. It weighs around 600 pounds.

#### Combat

### Berserk (Ex)
When a clay golem enters combat, there is a cumulative
1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem
goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the
nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if
no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction.
Once a clay golem goes berserk, no known method can reestablish control.

### Cursed Wound (Ex)
The damage a clay golem deals doesn't heal
naturally and resists healing spells. A character attempting to cast a
conjuration (healing) spell on a creature damaged by a clay golem must
succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the
injured character.

### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A clay golem is immune to any spell or
spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain
spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted
below.

A *move earth* spell drives the golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12
points of damage to it.

A *disintegrate* spell slows the golem (as the *slow* spell) for 1d6
rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage.

An *earthquake* spell cast directly at a clay golem stops it from moving
on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage. The golem gets no
saving throw against any of these effects.

Any magical attack against a clay golem that deals acid damage heals 1
point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If
the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal
hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, a
clay golem hit by the breath weapon of a black dragon heals 7 points of
damage if the attack would have dealt 22 points of damage. A clay golem
golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid
damage.

### Haste (Su)
After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a
clay golem can haste itself once per day as a free action. The effect
lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.

#### Construction

A clay golem's body must be sculpted from a single block of clay
weighing at least 1,000 pounds, treated with rare oils and powders worth
1,500 gp. Creating the body requires a DC 15 Craft (sculpting) check or
a DC 15 Craft (pottery) check.

A flesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid body parts,
stitched together into a single composite form. No natural animal
willingly tracks a flesh golem. The golem wears whatever clothing its
creator desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no
possessions and no weapons. It stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 500
pounds.

A flesh golem golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of
sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in
complete control of its body.

#### Combat

### Berserk (Ex)
When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a
cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free
and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage,
attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller
than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread
more destruction. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to
regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which
requires a DC 19 Charisma check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the
golem to reset the golem's berserk chance to 0%.

### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A flesh golem is immune to any spell or
spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain
spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted
below.

A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh golem (as
the *slow* spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any *slow* effect
on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage
the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause
the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as
temporary hit points. For example, a flesh golem hit by a *lightning
bolt* heals 3 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 11 points
of damage. A flesh golem golem gets no saving throw against attacks that
deal electricity damage.

#### Construction

The pieces of a flesh golem must come from normal human corpses that
have not decayed significantly. Assembly requires a minimum of six
different bodies---one for each limb, the torso (including head), and
the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents
and bindings worth 500 gp are also required. Note that creating a flesh
golem requires casting a spell with the evil descriptor.

Assembling the body requires a DC 13 Craft (leatherworking) check or a
DC 13 Heal check.

This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can be
fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below), although
it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its features are much
smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a
short sword in one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about
5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor
does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but
smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a
thick, solid foundation.

#### Combat

### Breath Weapon (Su)
10-foot cube, cloud of poisonous gas lasting 1
round, free action once every 1d4+1 rounds; initial damage 1d4 Con,
secondary damage 3d4 Con, Fortitude DC 19 negates. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
An iron golem is immune to any spell or
spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain
spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted
below.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as
the *slow* spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.

A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any *slow* effect on the
golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack
would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to
exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit
points. For example, an iron golem hit by a *fireball* gains back 6 hit
points if the damage total is 18 points. An iron golem gets no saving
throw against fire effects.

An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a
rust monster or a *rusting grasp* spell.

#### Construction

An iron golem's body is sculpted from 5,000 pounds of pure iron, smelted
with rare tinctures and admixtures costing at least 10,000 gp.
Assembling the body requires a DC 20 Craft (armorsmithing) check or a DC
20 Craft (weaponsmithing) check.

This golem has a humanoid body made from stone. A stone golem is 9 feet
tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is frequently stylized to
suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor,
with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs
worked into the stone of its limbs.

#### Combat

Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful and
difficult to harm.

### Slow (Su)
A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a
free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a
duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC
is Constitution-based.

### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A stone golem is immune to any spell or
spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain
spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted
below.

A *transmute rock to mud* spell slows a stone golem (as the *slow*
spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while *transmute mud to
rock* heals all of its lost hit points.

A *stone to flesh* spell does not actually change the golem's structure
but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.

#### Construction

A stone golem's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such
as granite, weighing at least 3,000 pounds. The stone must be of
exceptional quality, and costs 5,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a
DC 17 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 17 Craft (stonemasonry) check.

CL 14th; Craft Construct, *antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of
stunning*, caster must be at least 14th level; Price 90,000 gp; Cost
50,000 gp + 3,400 XP.

### Greater Stone Golem

A greater stone golem is 18 feet tall and weighs around 32,000 pounds.
It resembles a typical stone golem in all respects, except that the Will
save DC is 31 against its slow ability. CL 14th; Craft Construct,
*antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning*, caster must be at
least 14th level; Price 196,000 gp; Cost 105,000 gp + 7,640 XP.

A typical gorgon stands over 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 8
feet from snout to tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.

Gorgons are nothing if not aggressive. They attack intruders on sight,
attempting to trample, gore, or petrify them. There is no way to calm
these furious creatures, and they are impossible to domesticate.

### Combat

Whenever possible, a gorgon begins an encounter by charging at its
opponents.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds (but no more
than five times per day), turn to stone permanently, Fortitude DC 19
negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Trample (Ex)

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------

A gray render stands about 9 feet tall in spite of its hunched posture
and is about 4 feet wide. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.

Gray renders are never found in groups. Each of these asexual creatures
produces one offspring and carries it for a time in a pouch, but
thereafter the young render must fend for itself.

A unique quality of the gray render is its tendency to bond with,
protect, and provide for another creature (or group of creatures) native
to its surroundings. Whether accepted or not, the render always attempts
to remain fairly close, watching over its adopted charge(s) and daily
bringing an offering of meat. It never willingly harms adopted creatures
and retreats if they attack it.

### Combat

A gray render attacks to kill, whether to bring down prey or to protect
itself or those it has adopted. When hunting, it sometimes attempts to
hide and wait for prey to wander close.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a gray render must hit with
its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Rend (Ex)
A gray render that wins a grapple check after a
successful bite attack establishes a hold, latching onto the opponent's
body and tearing the flesh. This attack automatically deals 2d6+9 points
of damage.

### Skills
Gray renders have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks due to
their six keen eyes.

An adult grick is about 8 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to
the end of its body and weighs some 200 pounds. Its body coloration is
uniformly dark, with a pale underbelly.

### Combat

Gricks attack when hungry or threatened. They hunt by holing up near
high-traffic areas, using their natural coloration to blend into
convenient shadows. When prey (virtually anything that moves) ventures
near, they lash out with their tentacles. A grick's rubbery body seems
to shed blows of any kind. Its jaws are relatively small and weak
compared to its body mass, so rather than consume its kill immediately,
a grick normally drags its victim back to its lair to be eaten at its
leisure.

A grick's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction.

Multiple gricks do not fight in concert. Each attacks the prey closest
to it, and breaks off the fight as soon as it can drag dead or
unconscious prey away.

### Skills
A grick has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always
choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

\*Their coloration affords gricks a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when
in natural rocky areas.

Griffons are powerful, majestic creatures with the characteristics of
both lions and eagles. From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure
as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A
pair of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature's back and span 25
feet or more. A griffon weighs about 500 pounds.

A griffon cannot speak, but understands Common.

### Combat

Griffons prefer to pounce on their prey, either diving to the attack or
leaping from above.

### Pounce (Ex)
If a griffon dives upon or charges a foe, it can make a
full attack, including two rake attacks.

### Rake (Ex)
Attack bonus +8 melee, damage 1d6+2.

### Skills
Griffons have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Spot checks.

### Training a Griffon

Although intelligent, a griffon requires training before it can bear a
rider in combat. To be trained, a griffon must have a friendly attitude
toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy
check). Training a friendly griffon requires six weeks of work and a DC
25 Handle Animal check. Riding a griffon requires an exotic saddle. A
griffon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also
attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Griffon eggs are worth 3,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young
are worth 7,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear
or train a griffon.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a griffon is up to 300 pounds; a
medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

### Combat

Grimlocks are blind, but their exceptional senses of smell and hearing
allow them to notice foes nearby. As a result, they usually shun ranged
weapons and rush to the attack, brandishing their stone battleaxes.

### Blindsight (Ex)
Grimlocks can sense all foes within 40 feet as a
sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they treat all targets as
having total concealment.

Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and scent-based attacks, however,
and are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as
*ghost sound* or *silence*) and overpowering odors (such as *stinking
cloud* or incense-heavy air). Negating a grimlock's sense of smell or
hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the feat). If
both these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.

### Immunities
Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects,
illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.

### Skills
\*A grimlock's dull gray skin helps it hide in its native
terrain, conferring a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in mountains
or underground.

### Grimlocks as Characters

Grimlock characters possess the following racial traits.

--- +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, --2 Wisdom, --4
Charisma.

---Medium size.

---A grimlock's base land speed is 30 feet.

---Racial Hit Dice: A grimlock begins with two levels of monstrous
humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and
base saving throw bonuses of Fort +0, Ref +3, and Will +3.

---Racial Skills: A grimlock's monstrous humanoid levels give it skill
points equal to 5 x (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1). Its class skills are
Climb, Hide, Listen, and Spot. Grimlocks gain a +10 racial bonus on Hide
checks in mountain or underground settings.

---Racial Feats: A grimlock's monstrous humanoid levels give it one
feat.

---Weapon Proficiency: A grimlock is automatically proficient with the
battleaxe.

--- +4 natural armor bonus.

---Special Qualities (see above): Blindsight 40 ft., immunities, scent.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Grimlock. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
Dwarven, Gnome, Terran, Undercommon.

---Favored Class: Barbarian.

---Level adjustment +2.

# MONSTERS (H-I)

## Hag

Although different hags are unique in appearance and mannerism, they
have many aspects in common. All take the form of crones whose bent
shapes belie their fierce power and swiftness.

Hags speak Giant and Common.

### Combat

Hags are tremendously strong. They are naturally resistant to spells and
can cast magic of their own. Hags often gather to form coveys. A covey,
usually containing one hag of each type, can use powers beyond those of
the individual members.

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An annis commonly uses its *disguise self* ability to take the form of
an exceptionally tall human, a fair giant, or an ogre.

An annis stands some 8 feet tall and weighs about 325 pounds.

#### Combat

Though physically powerful, these hags do not favor simple assaults but
try to divide and confuse their foes before combat. They love to pose as
commoners or gentlefolk to lull their victims into a sense of false
security before they attack.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, an annis must hit a Large
or smaller opponent with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Rake (Ex)
Attack bonus +13 melee, damage 1d6+7. An annis can attack
a grappled foe with both claws at no penalty.

### Rend (Ex)
An annis that hits with both claw attacks latches onto
the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals
an extra 2d6+10 points of damage.

### Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*disguise self*, *fog cloud.* Caster
level 8th.

Green hags are found in desolate swamps and dark forests.

A green hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.

#### Combat

Green hags prefer to attack from hiding, usually after distracting foes.
They often use darkvision to their advantage by attacking during
moonless nights.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*dancing lights, disguise self,
ghost sound* (DC 12), *invisibility, pass without trace, tongues, water
breathing.* Caster level 9th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

touch attack. The opponent must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or
take 2d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Mimicry (Ex)
A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost any
animal found near its lair.

### Skills
A green hag has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sea hag is found in the water of seas or overgrown lakes.

A sea hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.

#### Combat

Sea hags are not subtle and prefer a direct approach to combat.

They usually remain in hiding until they can affect as many foes as
possible with their horrific appearance.

### Horrific Appearance (Su)
The sight of a sea hag is so revolting
that anyone (other than another hag) who sets eyes upon one must succeed
on a DC 13 Fortitude save or instantly be weakened, taking 2d6 points of
Strength damage. This damage cannot reduce a victim's Strength score
below 0, but anyone reduced to Strength 0 is helpless. Creatures that
are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot
be affected again by the same hag's horrific appearance for 24 hours.
The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Evil Eye (Su)
Three times per day, a sea hag can cast its dire gaze
upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC
13 Will save or be dazed for three days, although *remove curse* or
*dispel evil* can restore sanity sooner. In addition, an affected
creature must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or die from fright.
Creatures with immunity to fear effects are not affected by the sea
hag's evil eye. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Amphibious (Ex)
Although sea hags are aquatic, they can survive
indefinitely on land.

### Skills
A sea hag has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

### Hag Covey

From time to time, a trio of hags gathers as a covey. Usually this foul
triune includes one hag of each type, but this is not always the case.

#### Combat

Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in
combat.

A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and 1d4 evil
giants who do their bidding. These minions are often disguised with a
*veil* spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as spies. Such
minions often (60%) carry magic stones known as *hag eyes* (see below).

### Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*animate dead, bestow curse* (DC 17)*,
control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana* (DC 18)*,
polymorph, veil* (DC 19)*, vision.* Caster level 9th. The save DCs are
based on a Charisma score of 16. To use one of these abilities (which
requires a full-round action), all three hags must be within 10 feet of
one another, and all must participate.

Once per month, a covey that does not have a *hag eye* can create one
from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see below).

#### Hag Eye

A *hag eye* is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing
more than a semiprecious stone, but a *gem of seeing* or other such
effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a *hag eye* is worn as a
ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who created the
*hag eye* can see through it whenever they wish, so long as it is on the
same plane of existence as the hag. A *hag eye* has hardness 5 and 10
hit points. Destroying a *hag eye* deals 1d10 points of damage to each
member of the covey and causes the one who sustained the greatest damage
to be blinded for 24 hours.

## Half-Celestial

No matter the form, half-celestials are always comely and delightful to
the senses, having golden skin, sparkling eyes, angelic wings, or some
other sign of their higher nature.

### Creating a Half-Celestial

"Half-celestial" is an inherited template that can be added to any
living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher and
nonevil alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A half-celestial uses all the base creature's statistics and special
abilities except as noted here.

### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to outsider. Do not
recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size
is unchanged. Half-celestials are normally native outsiders.

### Speed
A half-celestial has feathered wings and can fly at twice the
base creature's base land speed (good maneuverability). If the base
creature has a fly speed, use that instead.

### Armor Class
Natural armor improves by +1 (this stacks with any
natural armor bonus the base creature has).

### Special Attacks
A half-celestial retains all the special attacks of
the base creature and also gains the following special abilities.

*Daylight (Su):* Half-celestials can use a *daylight* effect (as the
spell) at will.

*Smite Evil (Su):* Once per day a half-celestial can make a normal melee
attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against an
evil foe.

### Spell-Like Abilities
A half-celestial with an Intelligence or
Wisdom score of 8 or higher has two or more spell-like abilities,
depending on its Hit Dice, as indicated on the table below. The
abilities are cumulative

Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level
equals the creature's HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based.

  -------- ----------------------------------------
  HD       Abilities
  1--2     *Protection from evil* 3/day, *bless*
  3--4     Aid, detect evil
  5--6     Cure serious wounds, neutralize poison
  7--8     Holy smite, remove disease
  9--10    Dispel evil
  11--12   Holy word
  13--14   *Holy aura* 3/day, *hallow*
  15--16   Mass charm monster
  17--18   *Summon monster IX* (celestials only)
  19--20   Resurrection
  -------- ----------------------------------------

### Special Qualities
A half-celestial has all the special qualities of
the base creature, plus the following special qualities.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Immunity to disease.

---Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10.

---Damage reduction: 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or
more).

---A half-celestial's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

---Spell resistance equal to creature's HD + 10 (maximum 35).

--- +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poison.

### Abilities
Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex
+2, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4.

### Skills
A half-celestial gains skill points as an outsider and has
skill points equal to (8 + Int modifier) x (HD +3). Do not include Hit
Dice from class levels in this calculation---the half-celestial gains
outsider skill points only for its racial Hit Dice, and gains the normal
amount of skill points for its class levels. Treat skills from the base
creature's list as class skills, and other skills as cross-class.

### Challenge Rating
HD 5 or less, as base creature +1; HD 6 to 10, as
base creature +2; HD 11 or more, as base creature +3.

### Alignment
Always good (any).

### Level Adjustment
Same as base creature +4.

## Half-Dragon

Half-dragon creatures are always more formidable than others of their
kind that do not have dragon blood, and their appearance betrays their
nature---scales, elongated features, reptilian eyes, and exaggerated
teeth and claws. Sometimes they have wings.

### Creating a Half-Dragon

"Half-dragon" is an inherited template that can be added to any living,
corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A half-dragon uses all the base creature's statistics and special
abilities except as noted here.

### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to dragon. Size is
unchanged. Do not recalculate base attack bonus or saves.

### Hit Dice
Increase base creature's racial HD by one die size, to a
maximum of d12. Do not increase class HD.

### Speed
A half-dragon that is Large or larger has wings and can fly
at twice its base land speed (maximum 120 ft.) with average
maneuverability. A half-dragon that is Medium or smaller does not have
wings.

### Armor Class
Natural armor improves by +4.

### Attack
A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack, and
the claws are the primary natural weapon. If the base creature can use
weapons, the half-dragon retains this ability. A half-dragon fighting
without weapons uses a claw when making an attack action. When it has a
weapon, it usually uses the weapon instead.

### Full Attack
A half-dragon fighting without weapons uses both claws
and its bite when making a full attack. If armed with a weapon, it
usually uses the weapon as its primary attack and its bite as a natural
secondary attack. If it has a hand free, it uses a claw as an additional
natural secondary attack.

### Damage
Half-dragons have bite and claw attacks. If the base
creature does not have these attack forms, use the damage values in the
table below. Otherwise, use the values below or the base creature's
damage values, whichever are greater.

  ------------ ------------- -------------
  Size         Bite Damage   Claw Damage
  Fine         1             ---
  Diminutive   1d2           1

### Special Attacks
A half-dragon retains all the special attacks of
the base creature and gains a breath weapon based on the dragon variety
(see the table below), usable once per day. A half-dragon's breath
weapon deals 6d8 points of damage. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2
half-dragon's racial HD + half-dragon's Con modifier) reduces damage by
half.

  ---------------- --------------------------------------
  Dragon Variety   Breath Weapon
  Black            60-foot line of acid
  Blue             60-foot ine of lightning
  Green            30-foot cone of corrosive (acid) gas
  Red              30-foot cone of fire
  White            30-foot cone of cold
  Brass            60-foot line of fire
  Bronze           60-foot line of lightning

  Gold             30-foot cone of fire
  Silver           30-foot cone of cold
  ---------------- --------------------------------------

### Special Qualities
A half-dragon has all the special qualities of
the base creature, plus darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
A half-dragon has immunity to *sleep* and paralysis effects, and an
additional immunity based on its dragon variety.

  ---------------- ------------- ---------------- -------------
  Dragon Variety   Immunity      Dragon Variety   Immunity
  Black            Acid          Brass            Fire
  Blue             Electricity   Bronze           Electricity

  White            Cold          Silver           Cold
  ---------------- ------------- ---------------- -------------

### Abilities
Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +8, Con
+2, Int +2, Cha +2.

### Skills
A half-dragon gains skill points as a dragon and has skill
points equal to (6 + Int modifier) x (HD + 3). Do not include Hit Dice
from class levels in this calculation---the half-dragon gains dragon
skill points only for its racial Hit Dice, and gains the normal amount
of skill points for its class levels. Treat skills from the base
creature's list as class skills, and other skills as cross-class.

### Environment
Same as either the base creature or the dragon variety.

### Challenge Rating
Same as the base creature + 2 (minimum 3).

### Alignment
Same as the dragon variety.

### Level Adjustment
Same as base creature +3.

## Half-Fiend

No matter its form, a half-fiend is always hideous to behold, having
dark scales, horns, glowing red eyes, bat wings, a fetid odor, or some
other obvious sign that it is tainted with evil.

### Creating a Half-Fiend

"Half-fiend" is an inherited template that can be added to any living,
corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or more and nongood
alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A half-fiend uses all the base creature's statistics and special
abilities except as noted here.

### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to outsider. Do not
recalculate Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size is unchanged.
Half-fiends are normally native outsiders.

### Speed
A half-fiend has bat wings. Unless the base creature has a
better fly speed, the creature can fly at the base creature's base land
speed (average maneuverability).

### Armor Class
Natural armor improves by +1 (this stacks with any
natural armor bonus the base creature has).

### Attack
A half-fiend has two claw attacks and a bite attack, and the
claws are the primary natural weapon. If the base creature can use
weapons, the half-fiend retains this ability. A half-fiend fighting
without weapons uses a claw when making an attack action. When it has a
weapon, it usually uses the weapon instead.

### Full Attack
A half-fiend fighting without weapons uses both claws
and its bite when making a full attack. If armed with a weapon, it
usually uses the weapon as its primary attack and its bite as a natural
secondary attack. If it has a hand free, it uses a claw as an additional
natural secondary attack.

### Damage
Half-fiends have bite and claw attacks. If the base creature
does not have these attack forms, use the damage values in the table
below. Otherwise, use the values below or the base creature's damage
values, whichever are greater.

  ------------ ------------- -------------
  Size         Bite Damage   Claw Damage
  Fine         1             ---
  Diminutive   1d2           1
  Tiny         1d3           1d2
  Small        1d4           1d3
  Medium       1d6           1d4
  Large        1d8           1d6
  Huge         2d6           1d8
  Gargantuan   3d6           2d6
  Colossal     4d6           3d6
  ------------ ------------- -------------

### Special Attacks
A half-fiend retains all the special attacks of the
base creature and gains the following special attack.

*Smite Good (Su):* Once per day the creature can make a normal melee
attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against a
good foe.

Spell-Like Abilities: A half-fiend with an Intelligence or Wisdom score
of 8 or higher has spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice, as
indicated on the table below. The abilities are cumulative. Unless
otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level equals
the creature's HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based.

  -------- -----------------------------------
  HD       Abilities
  1--2     *Darkness* 3/day
  3--4     Desecrate
  5--6     Unholy blight
  7--8     *Poison* 3/day
  9--10    Contagion
  11--12   Blasphemy
  13--14   *Unholy aura* 3/day, *unhallow*
  15--16   Horrid wilting
  17--18   *Summon monster IX* (fiends only)
  19--20   Destruction
  -------- -----------------------------------

### Special Qualities
A half-fiend has all the special qualities of the
base creature, plus the following special qualities.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Immunity to poison.

---Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10.

---Damage reduction: 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or
more).

---A half-fiend's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

---Spell resistance equal to creature's HD + 10 (maximum 35).

### Abilities
Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex
+4, Con +2, Int +4, Cha +2.

### Skills
A half-fiend gains skill points as an outsider and has skill
points equal to (8 + Int modifier) x (HD + 3). Do not include Hit Dice
from class levels in this calculation---the half-fiend gains outsider
skill points only for its racial Hit Dice, and gains the normal amount
of skill points for its class levels. Treat skills from the base
creature's list as class skills, and other skills as cross-class.

### Challenge Rating
HD 4 or less, as base creature +1; HD 5 to 10, as
base creature +2; HD 11 or more, as base creature +3.

### Alignment
Always evil (any).

### Level Adjustment
+4.

Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35
pounds. They have brown or black eyes. Halfling men often have long
sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches almost unseen.
Halflings prefer simple, comfortable, and practical clothes. Unlike
members of most races, they prefer actual comfort to shows of wealth.
Halflings reach adulthood in their early twenties and generally live
into the middle of their second century. Halflings speak Halfling and
Common.

Most halflings encountered outside their home are warriors; the
information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.

### Combat

Halflings prefer to fight defensively, usually hiding and launching
ranged attacks as the foe approaches. Their tactics are very much like
those of elves but place more emphasis on cover and concealment and less
on mobility.

### Halfling Traits (Ex)
Halflings possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Dexterity, --2 Strength.

---Small size. +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4
bonus on Hide checks, --4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting and
carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters.

---A halfling's base land speed is 20 feet.

--- +2 racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.

--- +1 racial bonus on all saving throws.

--- +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. This bonus stacks
with the halfling's +1 bonus on saving throws in general.

--- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons and slings.

--- +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Halfling. Bonus Languages: Dwarven,
Elven, Gnome, Goblin, Orc.

---Favored Class: Rogue.

The halfling warrior presented here had the following ability scores
before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### Subraces

The information above is for the lightfoot halfling, the most common
halfling variety. There are two other major halfling subraces, which
differ from lightfoot halflings as follows.

#### Tallfellow

Tallfellows are somewhat rare among halfling folk. Tallfellows are 4
feet tall or more and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They generally
speak Elven in addition to Common and Halfling.

### Tallfellow Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the
lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.

--- +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks. Like an elf, a
tallfellow who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door
is entitled to a Search check as though actively looking for it. This
trait replaces the lightfoot's +2 bonus on Listen checks.

---Tallfellows are less athletic than lightfoot halflings and do not
have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.

#### Deep Halfling

These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common lightfeet.

Deep halflings are about 2-1/2 tall and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds.
Deep halflings speak Dwarven fluently.

### Deep Halfling Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the
lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Stonecunning: Like dwarves, deep halflings have a +2 racial bonus on
checks to notice unusual stonework. Something that isn't stone but that
is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A deep halfling
who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a check as
though actively searching and can use the Search skill to find stonework
traps as a rogue can. A deep halfling can also intuit depth, sensing the
approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can sense which
way is up.

--- +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks and Craft checks that are related
to stone or metal.

---Deep halflings are less athletic than lightfoot halflings and do not
have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.

Harpies like to entrance hapless travelers with their magical songs and
lead them to unspeakable torments. Only when a harpy has finished
playing with its new "toys" will it release them from suffering by
killing and consuming them.

### Combat

When a harpy engages in battle, it prefers to use Flyby Attack and
strike with a melee weapon.

### Captivating Song (Su)
The most insidious ability of the harpy is
its song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies) within
a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become
captivated. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that
successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same harpy's song for
24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A captivated victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route
available. If the path leads into a dangerous area (through flame, off a
cliff, or the like), that creature gets a second saving throw.
Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend
themselves. (Thus, a fighter cannot run away or attack but takes no
defensive penalties.) A victim within 5 feet of the harpy stands there
and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues
for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. A bard's
countersong ability allows the captivated creature to attempt a new Will
save.

### Skills
Harpies have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Listen checks.

### Harpy Archer

A cruel hunter and roaming brigand, the harpy archer has trained as a
fighter specializing in ranged combat. Harpy archers often become
mercenaries, selling their services to the highest bidder. When not
employed, they make ends meet as highway robbers, forcing merchant
caravans to pay protection money.

#### Combat

### Captivating Song (Su)
Will DC 17 negates.

*Possessions: +3 studded leather, +1 frost composite longbow* (+1 Str
bonus), 10 cold iron arrows, 10 silvered arrows, 5 *+2 arrows, lesser

archers may have different possessions.)

A typical hell hound stands 4-1/2 feet high at the shoulder and weighs
120 pounds.

Hell hounds do not speak but understand Infernal.

### Combat

Hell hounds are efficient hunters. A favorite pack tactic is to surround
prey quietly, then attack with one or two hounds, driving it toward the
rest with their fiery breath. If the prey doesn't run, the pack closes
in. Hell hounds track fleeing prey relentlessly.

A hell hound's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned

and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
10-foot cone, once every 2d4 rounds, damage 2d6
fire, Reflex DC 13 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Fiery Bite (Su)
A hell hound deals an extra 1d6 points of fire
damage every time it bites an opponent, as if its bite were a flaming
weapon.

### Skills
Hell hounds have a +5 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently
checks.

\*They also receive a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking
by scent, due to their keen sense of smell.

### Nessian Warhound

Nessian warhounds are coalblack mastiffs the size of draft horses, often
fitted with shirts of infernal chainmail.

Nessian warhounds resemble hell hounds, except as otherwise noted.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
10-foot cone, once every 2d4 rounds, damage 3d6
fire, Reflex DC 21 half. The save DC is Constitution- based.

### Fiery Bite (Su)
A Nessian warhound deals an extra 1d8 points of
fire d a m a g e every time it bites an opponent, as if its bite were a
flaming weapon.

Hippogriffs are aggressive flying creatures that combine features of
horses and giant eagles. Voracious omnivores, hippogriffs will hunt
humanoids as readily as any other meal. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet
long, has a wingspan of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.

### Combat

Hippogriffs dive at their prey and strike with their clawed forelegs.
When they cannot dive, they slash with claws and beak. Mated pairs and
flights of these creatures attack in concert, diving repeatedly to drive
away or kill intruders. Hippogriffs fight to the death to defend their
nests and their hatchlings, which are prized as aerial mounts and fetch
a handsome price in many civilized areas.

### Skills
Hippogriffs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

### Training a Hippogriff

A hippogriff requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.

Training a hippogriff requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle
Animal check. Riding a hippogriff requires an exotic saddle. A
hippogriff can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also
attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Hippogriff eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market, while
young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to
rear or train a hippogriff.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a hippogriff is up to 300
pounds; a medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900
pounds.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------

A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a wizard. These creatures
are weak combatants but make effective spies, messengers, and scouts. A
homunculus's creator determines its precise features. Homunculi are
little more than tools designed to carry out assigned tasks. They are
extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment and basic
nature. A homunculus cannot speak, but the process of creating one links
it telepathically with its creator.

It knows what its master knows and can convey to him or her everything
it sees and hears, out to a distance of 1,500 feet. A homunculus never
travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly.
If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to regain
contact with its master. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10
points of damage to its master.

If the creature's master is slain, the homunculus also dies, and its
body swiftly melts away into a pool of ichor.

### Combat

Homunculi land on their victims and bite with their venomous fangs.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage sleep for 1
minute, secondary damage sleep for another 5d6 minutes. The save DC is
Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

### Construction

A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ashes, mandrake root,
spring water, and one pint of the creator's own blood. The materials
cost 50 gp. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone
else to do the job. Creating the body requires a DC 12 Craft (sculpting)
check or a DC 12 Craft (pottery) check.

After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical
ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom,
similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If
the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building
and ritual can be performed together.

A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each
additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create.

Craft Construct, *arcane eye, mirror image, mending,* caster must be at
least 4th level; Price --- (never sold); Cost 1,050 gp + 78 XP.

8 feet long and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Although they are
surprisingly intelligent, howlers do not speak---they only howl. If
there is a language within the howls, as some have suggested, even
spells cannot decipher it. Howlers understand Abyssal.

### Combat

Howlers attack in groups, for they are cowardly and cruel. They prefer
to charge into combat, race out, and then charge in again. A howler's
natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as
chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Quills (Ex)
A howler's neck bristles with long quills. While
biting, the creature thrashes about, striking with 1d4 of them. An
opponent hit by a howler's quill attack must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex
save or have the quill break off in his or her flesh. Lodged quills
impose a --1 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks per quill. The save
DC is Dexterity-based.

A quill can be removed safely with a DC 20 Heal check; otherwise,
removing a quill deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.

### Howl (Ex)
All beings other than outsiders that hear the creature's
howling for an hour or longer are subject to its effect, though it does
not help the howler in combat. Anyone within hearing range of a howler
for a full hour must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or take 1 point of
Wisdom damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. The save must be repeated
for each hour of exposure. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.

### Training a Howler

Although intelligent, a howler requires training before it can bear a
rider in combat. To be trained, a howler must have a friendly attitude
toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy
check). Training a friendly howler requires six weeks of work and a DC
25 Handle Animal check. Riding a howler requires an exotic saddle. A
howler can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also
attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a howler is up to 460 pounds; a
medium load, 461--920 pounds; and a heavy load, 921--1,380 pounds. A
howler can drag 6,900 pounds.

Hydras are reptile-like monsters with multiple heads. A hydra is
gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan underbelly. The
eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white. It is about 20 feet long
and weighs about 4,000 pounds. Hydras do not speak.

### Combat

Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if they move
or charge during the round.

A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by slaying its
body. To sever a head, an opponent must make a successful sunder attempt
with a slashing weapon. (The player should declare where the attack is
aimed before making the attack roll.) Making a sunder attempt provokes
an attack of opportunity unless the foe has the Improved Sunder feat. An
opponent can strike at a hydra's heads from any position in which he
could strike at the hydra itself, because the hydra's head writhe and
whip about in combat. An opponent can ready an action to attempt to
sunder a hydra's head when the creature bites at him. Each of a hydra's
heads has hit points equal to the creature's full normal hit point
total, divided by its original number of heads. Losing a head deals
damage to the body equal to half the head's full normal hit points. A
natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss. A
hydra can no longer attack with a severed head but takes no other
penalties.

Each time a head is severed, two new heads spring from the stump in 1d4
rounds. A hydra can never have more than twice its original number of
heads at any one time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original
number wither and die within a day. To prevent a severed head from
growing back into two heads, at least 5 points of fire or acid damage
must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before the new heads
appear. A flaming weapon (or similar effect) deals its energy damage to
the stump in the same blow in which a head is severed. Fire or acid
damage from an area effect may burn multiple stumps in addition to
dealing damage to the hydra's body. A hydra does not die from losing its
heads until all its heads have been cut off and the stumps seared by
fire or acid.

A hydra's body can be slain just like any other creature's, but hydras
possess fast healing (see below) and are difficult to defeat in this
fashion. Any attack that is not (or cannot be) an attempt to sunder a
head affects the body.

Targeted magical effects cannot sever a hydra's heads (and thus must be
directed at the body) unless they deal slashing damage and could be used
to make sunder attempts.

### Fast Healing (Ex)
Each round, a hydra heals damage equal to 10 +
the number of its original heads.

### Skills
Hydras have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks,
thanks to their multiple heads.

A hydra has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special
action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while
swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

### Feats
A hydra's Combat Reflexes feat allows it to use all its heads
for attacks of opportunity.

### Pyrohydra

Huge Magical Beast (Fire)

These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire 10 feet high, 10 feet
wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4 rounds. Each
jet deals 3d6 points of fire damage per head. A successful Reflex save
halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's original number of
heads + hydra's Con modifier.

Fire attacks cannot prevent a pyrohydra's stump from growing new heads
(since a pyrohydra has immunity to fire), but 5 points of cold damage
does.

### Cryohydra

Huge Magical Beast (Cold)

These purplish hydras can breathe jets of frost 10 feet high, 10 feet
wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every 1d4 rounds. Each
jet deals 3d6 points of cold damage per head. A successful Reflex save
halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 hydra's original number of
heads + hydra's Con modifier.

Cold attacks cannot prevent a cryohydra's stump from growing new heads
(since a cryohydra has immunity to cold), but 5 points of fire damage
does.

## Inevitable

Inevitables are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the natural laws
of the universe.

Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind
of transgression, hunting down a person or group that has violated a
fundamental principle. When an inevitable is created, it receives its
first mission, then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate
punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some inevitables
insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using *geas* and
*mark of justice* to ensure compliance. From its first step, an
inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no
matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. Inevitables are
single-minded in pursuit of their quarry, but they are under orders to
leave innocents alone. Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however,
which sometimes creates conflicts within their programming.

Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission, but they
aren't suicidal. Faced with impending defeat, they are likely to
withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined but
patient foes. They ally with others if that helps accomplish their
mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long.

Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they're in observation
mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Their forms vary, but
all inevitables are gold-and-silver clockwork creatures, with gears and
pistons where muscles would be on flesh-and-blood creatures. Their eyes
glow with a golden radiance.

Note that unlike most constructs, inevitables have an Intelligence score
and can think, learn, and remember.

Inevitables speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and the native language
of their first target.

### Combat

Unless their very existence is threatened, inevitables focus completely
on the transgressor they've been assigned to, ignoring other combatants
completely. An inevitable might attack anyone who hinders its progress,
but it won't tarry beyond the point where it can reengage its quarry.
Inevitables take self-defense very seriously; anyone who attacks an
inevitable with what the creature perceives as deadly force is met with
deadly force in return.

An inevitable's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Fast Healing (Ex)
An inevitable heals a certain amount of damage
each round (specified in each variety's description) as long as it has
at least 1 hit point. However, damage dealt by chaotic weapons heals at
the normal rate.

Kolyaruts mete out punishment to those who break bargains and oaths.

Before beginning a mission against a deal-breaker, a kolyarut learns as
much about the contract or oath as possible. It's not interested in
those who break deals accidentally or against their will--- only those
who willingly break contracts violate the principle that kolyaruts are
created to uphold. If a written contract was broken, the kolyarut
typically carries a copy of the contract with it.

Kolyaruts are the most talkative of the inevitables, making credible
attempts at social niceties such as proper greetings before getting down
to the matter at hand. They can use *disguise self* to appear as almost
any kind of humanoid---useful if they need to go undercover to catch
their quarry.

#### Combat

Like all inevitables, a kolyarut is patient enough to study a target
before striking. It has a good idea of the deal-breaker's abilities and
defenses before it enters battle. When it fights, it tries to get the
conflict over as soon as possible, minimizing excess bloodshed and
mayhem. It doesn't let concern for innocents delay or endanger its
mission, however.

A kolyarut's favorite tactic is to use *invisibility* or *disguise self*
to sneak close, then eliminate the quarry with its vampiric touch
ability before it can react. A kolyarut has no compunctions about using
its vampiric touch ability on allies to increase its own power, if doing
so helps it complete its mission.

A kolyarut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Enervation Ray (Su)
A kolyarut can fire a black enervation ray at
targets within 200 feet. The effect is identical with the *enervation*
spell (caster level 13th).

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*discern lies* (DC 17)*, disguise
self, fear* (DC 17)*, hold person* (DC 16)*, invisibility, locate
creature, suggestion* (DC 16); 1/day---*hold monster* (DC 17)*, mark of
justice;* 1/week--- *geas/quest.* Caster level 13th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Vampiric Touch (Su)
As a melee touch attack, a kolyarut can steal
life force from its foe, as the *vampiric touch* spell (caster level
13th).

### Skills
A kolyarut has a +4 racial bonus on Disguise, Gather
Information, and Sense Motive checks.

Maruts confront those who would try to deny the grave itself.

Any who use unnatural means to extend their life span could be targeted
by a marut. Those who take extraordinary measures to cheat death in some
other way might be labeled transgressors as well. Those who use magic to
reverse death aren't worthy of a marut's attention unless they do so
repeatedly or on a massive scale.

When a marut has identified its target, it walks surely and implacably
toward the foe, never resting.

#### Combat

Once it has found its target, a marut brings it the death it has been
trying to avoid. Those who defile death through necromancy may instead
receive a *geas* and/or *mark of justice* to enforce proper respect. It
typically uses *wall of force* to shut off any escape routes, then opens
up with *chain lightning* while it closes to melee range. Once there, it
strikes with its massive fists, using *circle of death* if beset by
numbers of defenders. It hits spellcasting opponents with repeated uses
of *greater dispel magic,* and it uses *dimension door* and *locate
creature* to track down foes who flee.

A marut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Fists of Thunder and Lightning (Su)
A marut's left fist delivers a
loud thunderclap whenever it hits something, dealing an extra 3d6 points
of sonic damage and causing the target to be deafened for 2d6 rounds
(Fortitude DC 31 negates the deafness). Its right fist delivers a shock
for an extra 3d6 points of electricity damage, and the flash of
lightning causes the target to be blinded for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC
31 negates the blindness). The save DCs are Strength-based and include
the marut's Ability Focus feat.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*air walk, dimension door, fear* (DC
18)*, greater command* (DC 19)*, greater dispel magic, mass inflict
light wounds* (DC 19), *locate creature, true seeing;* 1/day---*chain
lightning* (DC 20)*, circle of death* (DC 20)*, mark of justice, wall of
force;* 1/week--- *earthquake* (DC 22)*, geas/quest, plane shift* (DC
21). Caster level 14th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Skills
A marut has a +4 racial bonus on Concentration, Listen, and
Spot checks.

Zelekhuts are charged with hunting down those who would deny
justice---especially those who flee to escape punishment. Expert
trackers, they use a combination of natural skill and magic to find
fugitives wherever they may hide.

A zelekhut may initially appear rather non-threatening---but when it is
about to enter combat, it can cause two spiked chains to spring forth
from its forearms as a free action. In similar fashion, it can cause a
pair of golden metallic wings to emerge from its back. Retracting the
chains or the wings is also a free action.

#### Combat

Once it has found its fugitive, a zelekhut uses its speed and its
spell-like abilities to cover the most likely escape routes. Then it
immobilizes any defenders while attempting to protect any innocent
bystanders. Finally, it apprehends the fugitive with its spiked chains,
tripping or disarming the foe as needed.

A zelekhut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*clairaudience/clairvoyance,
dimensional anchor, dispel magic, fear* (DC 16)*, hold person* (DC 15)*,
locate creature, true seeing;* 3/day---*hold monster* (DC 17)*, mark of
justice*; 1/week--- *lesser geas* (DC 16). Caster level 8th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.

### Skills
A zelekhut has a +4 racial bonus on Search and Sense Motive
checks.

### Feats
Due to its centaur-like construction, a zelekhut qualifies
for feats as if it had the Mounted Combat feat.

Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air.
They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon them to perform
specific tasks.

A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner
commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away.
The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys
only the summoner. However, it resents protracted missions or complex
tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.

Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A *see invisibility* spell
shows only a dim outline of a cloud, while a *true seeing* spell reveals
a roiling cloud of vapor.

These creatures speak only Auran but can understand Common.

### Combat

An invisible stalker attacks by using the air itself as a weapon. It
creates a sudden, intense blast of wind that pounds a single target on
the same plane as the creature.

An invisible stalker can be killed only when it is on the Elemental
Plane of Air. When performing a task elsewhere, it automatically returns
to its home plane when it takes damage sufficient to destroy it.

### Natural Invisibility (Su)
This ability is constant, allowing a
stalker to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is
inherent and not subject to the *invisibility purge* spell.

### Improved Tracking (Ex)
An invisible stalker is a consummate tracker
and makes Spot checks instead of the usual Survival checks to trace a
creature's passage.

Kobolds are short, reptilian humanoids with cowardly and sadistic
tendencies.

A kobold's scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty black
color. It has glowing red eyes. Its tail is nonprehensile. Kobolds wear
ragged clothing, favoring red and orange. A kobold is 2 to 2-1/2 feet
tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. Kobolds speak Draconic with a voice
that sounds like that of a yapping dog.

### Combat

Kobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds---at least two to one---or
trickery; should the odds fall below this threshold, they usually flee.
However, they attack gnomes on sight if their numbers are equal.

They begin a fight by slinging bullets, closing only when they can see
that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up
ambushes near trapped areas.

### Light Sensitivity (Ex)
Kobolds are dazzled in bright sunlight or
within the radius of a *daylight* spell.

### Skills
Kobolds have a +2 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking),
Profession (miner), and Search checks.

Six of the beast's tentacles are shorter arms about 30 feet long; the
remaining two are nearly 60 feet long and covered with barbs. Its
beaklike mouth is located where the tentacles meet the lower portion of
its body.

Krakens speak Common and Aquan.

### Combat

Krakens strike their opponents with their barbed tentacles, then grab
and crush with their arms or drag victims into their huge jaws. An
opponent can make sunder attempts against a kraken's tentacles or arms
as if they were weapons. A kraken's tentacles have 20 hit points, and
its arms have 10 hit points. If a kraken is currently grappling a target
with one tentacle or arm, it usually uses another limb to make its
attack of opportunity against the sunder attempt. Severing a kraken's
tentacle or arm deals damage to the kraken equal to half the limb's full
normal hit points. A kraken usually withdraws from combat if it loses
both tentacles or three of its arms. A kraken regrows severed limbs in
1d10+10 days.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, the kraken must hit with an
arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Constrict (Ex)
A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle damage with
a successful grapple check.

### Jet (Ex)
A kraken can jet backward once per round as a full-round
action, at a speed of 280 feet. It must move in a straight line, but
does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

### Ink Cloud (Ex)
A kraken can emit a cloud of jet-black ink in an
80-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides
total concealment, which the kraken normally uses to escape a fight that
is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in
darkness.

### Spell-Like Abilities
1/day---*control weather, control winds,
dominate animal* (DC 18), *resist energy.* Caster level 9th. The save DC
is Charisma-based.

### Skills
A kraken has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

The krenshar is a strange, catlike carnivore with extremely flexible
skin on its head. A typical krenshar measures 4 or 5 feet in length with
a long, narrow head. It weighs about 175 pounds.

### Combat

Krenshars use solitary scouts to drive prey into the waiting clutches of
the pride. The scout appears from hiding, uses its scare ability, then
chases the fleeing target to join the attack.

### Scare (Ex or Su)
As a standard action, a krenshar can pull the skin
back from its head, revealing the musculature and bony structures of its
skull. This alone is usually sufficient to scare away foes (treat as a
Bluff check with a +3 bonus).

Combining this scare ability with a loud screech produces an unsettling
effect that works like a *scare* spell from a 3rd-level caster (Will DC
13 partial). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again
by the same krenshar's scare ability for 24 hours. The shriek does not
affect other krenshars. This is a supernatural, sonic mind-affecting
fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Skills
Krenshars have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Move Silently
checks.

A typical lamia is about 8 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds.

### Combat

Though a lamia is powerful and dangerous in close combat, it has no
stomach for a fair fight. It uses its illusion abilities to lure heroes
into perilous situations, and then uses its Spring Attack feat to bound
out of the shadows and drain Wisdom from its opponents. When it has
sapped the will of its victim, it uses its enchantment abilities to
beguile and ensnare the unfortunate soul. A lamia forced into physical
combat attacks with a dagger in one of its human hands and a pair of
lion-like claws.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*disguise self, ventriloquism*;
3/day---*charm monster* (DC 15), *major image* (DC 14), *mirror image,
suggestion* (DC 14); 1/day---*deep slumber* (DC 14). Caster level 9th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Wisdom Drain (Su)
A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time it
hits with its melee touch attack. (Unlike with other kinds of ability
drain attacks, a lamia does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom
drain.) Lamias try to use this power early in an encounter to make foes
more susceptible to *charm monster* and *suggestion.*

### Skills
Lamias have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Hide checks.

A typical lammasu is about 8 feet long and weighs about 500 pounds.
Lammasus speak Common, Draconic, and Celestial.

### Combat

A lammasu attacks with spells or its razor-sharp claws. It almost always
enters combat if it observes a good creature being threatened by evil.

### Spells
A lammasu casts spells as a 7th-level cleric, and can choose
spells from the cleric spell list, plus any two of the following

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Combat

Leonals like their battles as straightforward as can be. They begin with
a roar to put their foes off balance, then follow up with a frenzy of
claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their
pride, watching one another's flanks and setting up devastating attacks.

A leonal's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Roar (Su)
A leonal can roar up to three times per day. Each roar
releases a blast in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of a
*holy word* spell and deals an extra 2d6 points of sonic damage
(Fortitude DC 20 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Pounce (Ex)
If a leonal charges a foe, it can make a full attack,
including two rake attacks.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a leonal must hit with its
bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

### Rake (Ex)
Attack bonus +20 melee, damage 1d6+8.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*detect thoughts, fireball* (DC 15),
*hold monster* (DC 17)*, polymorph, wall of force;* 3/day---*cure
critical wounds* (DC 16)*, neutralize poison, remove disease;*
1/day---*heal* (DC 18). Caster level 10th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Lay on Hands (Su)
As the paladin class feature, except that each
day, a leonal can heal an amount of damage equal to its full normal hit
points.

### Protective Aura (Su)
Against attacks made or effects created by
evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a
+4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the
leonal. Otherwise, it functions as a *magic circle against evil* effect
and a *lesser globe of invulnerability,* both with a radius of 20 feet
(caster level equals leonal's HD). (The defensive benefits from the
circle are not included in a leonal's statistics block.)

### Speak with Animals (Su)
This ability works like *speak with
animals* (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require
sound.

### Skills
Leonals have a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move
Silently checks.

## Lich

A lich is an undead spellcaster, usually a wizard or sorcerer but
sometimes a cleric or other spellcaster, who has used its magical powers
to unnaturally extend its life.

A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched
tight across horribly visible bones. Its eyes have long ago been lost to
decay, but bright pinpoints of crimson light burn on in the empty
sockets.

Liches speak Common plus any other languages they knew in life.

### Creating a Lich

"Lich" is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid
creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can
create the required phylactery; see The Lich's Phylactery, below.

A lich has all the base creature's statistics and special abilities
except as noted here.

### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to undead. Do not
recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is
unchanged.

### Hit Dice
Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.

### Armor Class
A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base
creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is better.

### Attack
A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per round. If
the base creature can use weapons, the lich retains this ability. A
creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A lich
fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack or its primary
natural weapon (if it has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its
touch or a weapon, as it desires.

### Full Attack
A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch
attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with
a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a
touch as a natural secondary attack, provided it has a way to make that
attack (either a free hand or a natural weapon that it can use as a
secondary attack).

### Damage
A lich without natural weapons has a touch attack that uses
negative energy to deal 1d8+5 points of damage to living creatures; a
Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 lich's HD + lich's Cha modifier) halves the
damage. A lich with natural weapons can use its touch attack or its
natural weaponry, as it prefers. If it chooses the latter, it deals
1d8+5 points of extra damage on one natural weapon attack.

### Special Attacks
A lich retains all the base creature's special
attacks and gains those described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2
lich's HD + lich's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.

*Fear Aura (Su):* Liches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and
evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the
lich must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by a *fear*
spell from a sorcerer of the lich's level. A creature that successfully
saves cannot be affected again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours.

*Paralyzing Touch (Su):* Any living creature a lich hits with its touch
attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed.
*Remove paralysis* or any spell that can remove a curse can free the
victim (see the *bestow curse* spell description).

The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead,
though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim
is still alive..

*Spells:* A lich can cast any spells it could cast while alive.

### Special Qualities
A lich retains all the base creature's special
qualities and gains those described below.

### Turn Resistance (Ex)
A lich has +4 turn resistance.

### Damage Reduction (Su)
A lich's undead body is tough, giving the
creature damage reduction 15/bludgeoning and magic. Its natural weapons
are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Immunities (Ex)
Liches have immunity to cold, electricity,
polymorph (though they can use polymorph effects on themselves), and
mind-affecting attacks.

### Abilities
Increase from the base creature as follows: Int +2, Wis
+2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score.

### Skills
Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the
base creature.

### Organization
Solitary or troupe (1 lich, plus 2--4 vampires and
5--8 vampire spawn).

### Challenge Rating
Same as the base creature + 2.

### Treasure
Standard coins; double goods; double items.

### Alignment
Any evil.

### Advancement
By character class.

### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +4.

### Lich Characters

The process of becoming a lich is unspeakably evil and can be undertaken
only by a willing character. A lich retains all class abilities it had
in life.

### The Lich's Phylactery

An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a magic phylactery in
which the character stores its life force. As a rule, the only way to
get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its
phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich reappears 1d10 days after
its apparent death.

Each lich must make its own phylactery, which requires the Craft
Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast spells and have a
caster level of 11th or higher. The phylactery costs 120,000 gp and
4,800 XP to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator
at the time of creation.

The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box containing
strips of parchment on which magical phrases have been transcribed. The
box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40.

Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or
similar items.

A typical lillend's coils are 20 feet long. The creature weighs about
3,800 pounds. A few lillends have male torsos.

Lillends speak Celestial, Infernal, Abyssal, and Common.

### Combat

Lillends are generally peaceful unless they intend vengeance against
someone they believe guilty of harming, or even threatening, a favored
art form, artwork, or artist. Then they become implacable foes. They use
their spells and spell-like abilities to confuse and weaken opponents
before entering combat. A covey of lillends usually discusses strategy
before a battle.

A lillend's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Constrict (Ex)
A lillend deals 2d6+5 points of damage with a
successful grapple check. Constricting uses the entire lower portion of
its body, so it cannot take any move actions when constricting, though
it can still attack with its sword.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a lillend must hit with its
tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Spells
A lillend casts arcane spells as a 6th-level bard.

*Typical Bard Spells Known* (3/4/3; save DC 14 + spell level): 0---
*dancing lights, daze, detect magic, lullaby, mage hand, read magic;*
1st--- *charm person, cure light wounds, identify, sleep;* 2nd---*hold
person, invisibility, sound burst.*

### Spell-Like Abilities
3/day---*darkness, hallucinatory terrain* (DC
18), *knock, light;* 1/day---*charm person* (DC 15), *speak with
animals, speak with plants*. Caster level 10th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

A lillend also has the bardic music ability as a 6th-level bard.

### Skills
Lillends have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks.

A lizardfolk is usually 6 to 7 feet tall with green, gray, or brown
scales. Its tail is used for balance and is 3 to 4 feet long. A
lizardfolk can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds.

Lizardfolk speak Draconic.

### Combat

Lizardfolk fight as unorganized individuals. They prefer frontal
assaults and massed rushes, sometimes trying to force foes into the
water, where the lizardfolk have an advantage. If outnumbered or if
their territory is being invaded, they set snares, plan ambushes, and
make raids to hinder enemy supplies. Advanced tribes use more
sophisticated tactics and have better traps and ambushes.

equal to four times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

for carrying a heavy shield.

Although humanoid in shape, locathahs are clearly more fish than human.
The average locathah stands 5 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds. Females
and males look very much alike, although the former can be recognized by
the two ochre stripes marking their egg sacs.

Locathahs speak Aquan.

### Combat

Any battle with locathahs usually begins with the creatures loosing
volleys of bolts from their crossbows; underwater, their crossbows have
a range increment of 20 feet. If they have managed to set up an ambush
or other trap, they continue to employ crossbows for as long as
possible. Otherwise, they close to bring their longspears into play.
Although primarily used for fishing, these spears make formidable
weapons.

Locathahs lack teeth, claws, and other natural weapons, so they are not
especially dangerous if unarmed. A weaponless locathah will generally
turn and flee.

### Skills
A locathah has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered.

It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a
straight line.

## Lycanthrope

Lycanthropes are humanoids or giants who can transform themselves into
animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other members
of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those who have been
afflicted for a long time tend to have or acquire features reminiscent
of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a
powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes
(which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural
intelligence.

Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease. Sometimes a lycanthrope begins
life as a normal humanoid or giant who subsequently contracts
lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope. Such a creature is
called an afflicted lycanthrope. Other lycanthropes are born as
lycanthropes, and are known as natural lycanthropes.

### Combat

A lycanthrope in its humanoid (or giant) form uses whatever tactics and
weapons are favored by others of its kind, though it tends to be
slightly more aggressive. A lycanthrope possesses the senses of its
animal form, including scent and low-light vision, and it has a deep
empathy for (and ability to communicate with) animals of its animal
form. An afflicted lycanthrope damaged in combat may be overwhelmed by
rage, causing it to change to its animal form involuntarily.

A lycanthrope in animal form fights like the animal it resembles,
although its bite carries the disease of lycanthropy. It is
preternaturally cunning and strong, and possesses damage reduction that
is overcome only by silvered weapons.

Finally, a natural lycanthrope (or an afflicted lycanthrope that has
become aware of its affliction) can assume a hybrid form that is a mix
of its humanoid and animal forms. A hybrid has hands and can use
weapons, but it can also attack with its teeth and claws. A hybrid can
spread lycanthropy with its bite, and it has the same damage reduction
that its animal form possesses.

Werebears in humanoid form tend to be stout, well-muscled, and hairy.
Their brown hair is thick, and males usually wear beards. They may have
reddish, blond, ivory, or black hair, matching the color of the ursine
form. They dress in simple cloth and leather garments that are easy to
remove, repair, or replace

#### Combat

Werebears fight just as brown bears do in animal form. In humanoid or
hybrid form, they favor large, heavy weapons such as greataxes or
greatswords. The werebear's greataxe is a Medium weapon, so it can wield
the axe in one hand in hybrid form.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A werebear can assume the form of a brown bear
or a bear-humanoid hybrid.

### Bear Empathy (Ex)
Communicate with bears and dire bears, and +4
racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against bears and dire bears.

### Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)
Any humanoid or giant hit by a werebear's
bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude
save or contract lycanthropy.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a werebear must be in bear
form and must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Skills
Werebears have a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks in any bear
form.

The werebear presented here is a 1st-level human warrior and natural
lycanthrope, using the following base ability scores: Str 13, Dex 11,
Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Weretigers in humanoid form tend to be sleekly muscular, taller than
average, and very agile.

#### Combat

Weretigers can assume a hybrid form as well as an animal form. In tiger
form, they can pounce and grab just as normal tigers do. In hybrid form,
they rely on their deadly claws.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A weretiger can assume a bipedal hybrid form or
the form of a tiger.

### Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)
Any humanoid or giant hit by a
weretiger's bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed on a DC 15
Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a weretiger in tiger form
must hit with a claw or bite attack. It can then attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If
it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

### Pounce (Ex)
If a weretiger in tiger form charges an opponent, it
can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.

### Rake (Ex)
Attack bonus +9 melee, damage 1d8+3.

### Tiger Empathy (Ex)
Communicate with tigers and dire tigers, and +4
racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against tigers and dire tigers.

### Skills
In any form, weretigers have a +4 bonus on Balance, Hide,
and Move Silently checks. \*In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth,
the Hide bonus improves to +8 in the tiger form.

The weretiger presented here is a 1st-level human warrior and natural
lycanthrope, using the following base ability scores: Str 13, Dex 11,
Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Werewolves in humanoid form have no distinguishing traits.

#### Combat

In wolf form, a werewolf can trip just as a normal wolf does. A werewolf
in hybrid form usually dispenses with weapon attacks, though it can
wield a weapon and use its bite as a secondary natural attack.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A werewolf can assume a bipedal hybrid form or
the form of a wolf.

### Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)
Any humanoid or giant hit by a werewolf's
bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude
save or contract lycanthropy.

### Trip (Ex)
A werewolf in animal form that hits with a bite attack
can attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check modifier) as a free action
without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity.

If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the werewolf.

### Wolf Empathy (Ex)
Communicate with wolves and dire wolves, and +4
racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against wolves and dire wolves.

### Skills
\*A werewolf in hybrid or wolf form gains a +4 racial bonus
on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

The werewolf presented here is based on a 1st-level human warrior and
natural lycanthrope, using the following base ability scores: Str 13,
Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Stronger, hardier, and more deadly than its lesser fellows, the werewolf
lord is a murderous beast that delights in wreaking havoc.

The werewolf lord presented here is a 10th-level human fighter and
natural lycanthrope, using the following base ability scores: Str 16,
Dex 14, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 12.

#### Combat

Werewolf lords can assume a hybrid form as well as an animal form. In
dire wolf form, they can trip just as normal wolves do. In hybrid form,
they can wield weapons or fight with their claws.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A werewolf lord can assume a bipedal hybrid
form or the form of a dire wolf.

### Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)
Any humanoid or giant hit by a werewolf
lord's bite attack in wolf or hybrid form must succeed on a DC 15
Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.

### Trip (Ex)
A werewolf lord in dire wolf form that hits with a bite
attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+15 check modifier) as a free
action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of
opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the
werewolf lord.

### Wolf Empathy (Ex)
Communicate with wolves and dire wolves, and +4
racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against wolves and dire wolves.

### Skills
\*A werewolf lord in hybrid or wolf form gains a +4 racial
bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

*Possessions: +2 mithral chain shirt, +3 heavy shield, +2 bastard sword,
gauntlets of ogre power, cloak of resistance +2,* masterwork composite
longbow (+4 Str bonus).

Dire wereboars in giant form look much like normal hill giants, though
slightly stockier, and with coarser, stiffer hair and stiff. The dire
wereboar described here is based on a hill giant and natural lycanthrope
with normal ability scores for a hill giant.

### Combat

Dire wereboars anger quickly. They usually begin a battle in giant form,
then switch to hybrid form to take advantage of their immense strength
in that shape. They like to use their Improved Bull Rush and Improved
Sunder feats to shove opponents around and smash their weapons and
shields.

### Alternate Form (Su)
A dire wereboar can assume a bipedal hybrid
form or the form of a dire boar.

### Boar Empathy (Ex)
Communicate with boars and dire boars, and +4
racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against boars and dire boars.

### Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)
Any humanoid or giant hit by a dire
wereboar's bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed on a DC 15
Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.

### Ferocity (Ex)
A dire wereboar is such a tenacious combatant that it
continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.

### Creating a Lycanthrope

"Lycanthrope" is a template that can be added to any humanoid or giant
(referred to hereafter as the base creature). The lycanthrope template
can be inherited (for natural lycanthropes) or acquired (for afflicted
lycanthropes). Becoming a lycanthrope is very much like multiclassing as
an animal and gaining the appropriate Hit Dice.

### Size and Type
The base creature's type does not change, but the
creature gains the shapechanger subtype. The lycanthrope takes on the
characteristics of some type of carnivorous or omnivorous creature of
the animal type (referred to hereafter as the base animal).

This animal can be any predator, scavenger, or omnivore whose size is
within one size category of the base creature's size (Small, Medium, or
Large for a Medium base creature). Lycanthropes can also adopt a hybrid
shape that combines features of the base creature and the base animal. A
lycanthrope's hybrid form is the same size as the base animal or the
base creature, whichever is larger.

A lycanthrope uses either the base creature's or the base animal's
statistics and special abilities in addition to those described here.

### Hit Dice and Hit Points
Same as the base creature plus those of the
base animal. To calculate total hit points, apply Constitution modifiers
according to the score the lycanthrope has in each form.

### Speed
Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on which
form the lycanthrope is using. Hybrids use the base creature's speed.

### Armor Class
The base creature's natural armor bonus increases by +2
in all forms. In hybrid form, the lycanthrope's natural armor bonus is
equal to the natural armor bonus of the base animal or the base
creature, whichever is better.

### Base Attack/Grapple
Add the base attack bonus for the base animal
to the base attack bonus for the base creature. The lycanthrope's
grapple bonus uses its attack bonus and modifiers for Strength and size
depending on the lycanthrope's form.

### Attacks
Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on
which form the lycanthrope is using. A lycanthrope in hybrid form gains
two claw attacks and a bite attack as natural weapons.

These weapons deal damage based on the hybrid form's size. A hybrid may
attack with a weapon and a bite, or may attack with its natural weapons.
The bite attack of a hybrid is a secondary attack.

  ------------- ------ ------
  Hybrid Size   Claw   Bite
  Small         1d3    1d4
  Medium        1d4    1d6
  Large         1d6    1d8
  Huge          2d4    2d6
  ------------- ------ ------

### Damage
Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on which
form the lycanthrope is in.

### Special Attacks
A lycanthrope retains the special attacks of the
base creature or base animal, depending on which form it is using, and
also gains the special attacks described below.

A lycanthrope's hybrid form does not gain any special attacks of the
base animal. A lycanthrope spellcaster cannot cast spells with verbal,
somatic, or material components while in animal form, or spells with
verbal components while in hybrid form.

***Curse of Lycanthropy (Su):***Any humanoid or giant hit by a natural
lycanthrope's bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed on a DC
15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy. If the victim's size is not
within one size category of the lycanthrope the victim cannot contract
lycanthropy from that lycanthrope. Afflicted lycanthropes cannot pass on
the curse of lycanthropy.

### Special Qualities
A lycanthrope retains all the special qualities
of the base creature and the base animal, and also gains those described
below.

***Alternate Form (Su):***A lycanthrope can shift into animal form as
though using the *polymorph* spell on itself, though its gear is not
affected, it does not regain hit points for changing form, and only the
specific animal form indicated for the lycanthrope can be assumed. It
does not assume the ability scores of the animal, but instead adds the
animal's physical ability score modifiers to its own ability scores. A
lycanthrope also can assume a bipedal hybrid form with prehensile hands
and animalistic features.

Changing to or from animal or hybrid form is a standard action.

A slain lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains
dead. Separated body parts retain their animal form, however.

Afflicted lycanthropes find this ability difficult to control (see
Lycanthropy as an Affliction, below), but natural lycanthropes have full
control over this power.

***Damage Reduction (Ex):*** An afflicted lycanthrope in animal or
hybrid form has damage reduction 5/silver. A natural lycanthrope in
animal or hybrid form has damage reduction 10/silver.

***Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex):***In any form, lycanthropes can
communicate and empathize with normal or dire animals of their animal
form. This gives them a +4 racial bonus on checks when influencing the
animal's attitude and allows the communication of simple concepts and
(if the animal is friendly) commands, such as "friend," "foe," "flee,"
and "attack."

***Low-Light Vision (Ex):*** A lycanthrope has low-light vision in any
form.

***Scent (Ex):*** A lycanthrope has the scent ability in any form.

### Base Save Bonuses
Add the base save bonuses of the base animal to
the base save bonuses of the base creature.

### Abilities
All lycanthropes gain +2 to Wisdom. In addition, when in
animal form, a lycanthrope's physical ability scores improve according
to its kind, as set out in the table below. These adjustments are equal
to the animal's normal ability scores --10 or --11. A lycanthrope in
hybrid form modifies its physical ability scores by the same amount.

In addition, a lycanthrope may also gain an additional ability score
increase by virtue of its extra Hit Dice.

### Skills
A lycanthrope gains skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier,
minimum 1) per Hit Die of its animal form, as if it had multiclassed
into the animal type. (Animal is never its first Hit Die, though, and it
does not gain quadruple skill points for any animal Hit Die.) Any skill
given in the animal's description is a class skill for the lycanthrope's
animal levels. In any form, a lycanthrope also has any racial skill
bonuses of the base creature and of the base animal, although
conditional skill bonuses only apply in the associated form.

### Feats
Add the base animal's feats to the base creature's. If this
results in a lycanthrope having the same feat twice, the lycanthrope
gains no additional benefit unless the feat normally can be taken more
once, in which case the duplicated feat works as noted in the feat
description. This process may give the lycanthrope more feats than a
character of its total Hit Dice would normally be entitled to; if this
occurs, any "extra" feats are denoted as bonus feats.

It's possible that a lycanthrope cannot meet the prerequisites for all
its feats when in humanoid form. If this occurs, the lycanthrope still
has the feats, but cannot use them when in humanoid form. A lycanthrope
receives Iron Will as a bonus feat.

### Environment
Same as either the base creature or base animal.

### Organization
Solitary or pair, sometimes family (3--4), pack
(6--10), or troupe (family plus related animals)

### Challenge Rating
By class level or base creature, modified
according to the HD of the base animal: 1 HD or 2 HD, +2; 3 HD to 5 HD,
+3; 6 HD to 10 HD, +4; 11 HD to 20 HD, +5; 21 or more HD, +6.

### Treasure
Standard.

### Alignment
Any. Noble creatures such as bears, eagles, and lions
tend to produce good-aligned lycanthropes. Sinister creatures such as
rats, snakes, and wolves tend to produce evil-aligned lycanthropes. This
is a reflection of how these animals are perceived, not any innate
quality of the animal itself, so the alignment of the animal form can be
arbitrarily assigned.

### Advancement
By character class.

### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +2 (afflicted) or +3
(natural). In addition, a lycanthrope's character level is increased by
the number of racial Hit Dice the base animal has.

### Lycanthropy as an Affliction

When a character contracts lycanthropy through a lycanthrope's bite (see
above), no symptoms appear until the first night of the next full moon.
On that night, the afflicted character involuntarily assumes animal form
and forgets his or her own identity, temporarily becoming an NPC. The
character remains in animal form, assuming the appropriate alignment,
until the next dawn.

The character's actions during this first episode are dictated by the
alignment of its animal form. The character remembers nothing about the
entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he succeeds on a DC 15
Wisdom check, in which case he becomes aware of his lycanthropic
condition.

Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary transformation under
the full moon and whenever damaged in combat. He or she feels an
overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on a Control Shape check
(see below) to resist changing into animal form. Any player character
not yet aware of his or her lycanthropic condition temporarily becomes
an NPC during an involuntary change, and acts according to the alignment
of his or her animal form.

A character with awareness of his condition retains his identity and
does not lose control of his actions if he changes. However, each time
he changes to his animal form, he must make a Will save (DC 15 + number
of times he has been in animal form) or permanently assume the alignment
of his animal form in all shapes.

Once a character becomes aware of his affliction, he can now voluntarily
attempt to change to animal or hybrid form, using the appropriate
Control Shape check DC. An attempt is a standard action and can be made
each round. Any voluntary change to animal or hybrid form immediately
and permanently changes the character's alignment to that of the
appropriate lycanthrope.

#### Changing Form

Changing form is a standard action. If the change is involuntary, the
character performs the change on his next turn following the triggering
event. Changing to animal or hybrid form ruins the character's armor and
clothing (including any items worn) if the new form is larger than the
character's natural form; carried items are simply dropped. Characters
can hastily doff clothing while changing, but not armor. Magic armor
survives the change if it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. An
afflicted character who is not aware of his condition remains in animal
form until the next dawn. An afflicted character who is aware of his or
her condition (see above) can try to resume humanoid form following a
change (voluntary or involuntary) with a Control Shape check, but if he
fails his check, he remains in animal (or hybrid) form until the
following dawn.

#### Curing Lycanthropy

An afflicted character who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called
wolfsbane) within 1 hour of a lycanthrope's attack can attempt a DC 20
Fortitude save to shake off the affliction. If a healer administers the
herb, use the character's save bonus or the healer's Heal modifier,
whichever is higher. The character gets only one chance, no matter how
much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh
(picked within the last week).

However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. The character must succeed
on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage. One
minute later, the character must succeed on a second DC 13 save or take
an additional 2d6 points of Strength damage.

A *remove disease* or *heal* spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or
higher also cures the affliction, provided the character receives the
spell within three days of the lycanthrope's attack.

The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast *remove curse* or
*break enchantment* on the character during one of the three days of the
full moon. After receiving the spell, the character must succeed on a DC
20 Will save to break the curse (the caster knows if the spell works).
If the save fails, the process must be repeated.

Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in
cages until the cure takes effect.

Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy.

### Lycanthropes as Characters

Becoming a lycanthrope does not change a character's favored class but
usually changes alignment (see above). This alignment change may cause
characters of certain classes to lose some of their class features.

Lycanthrope characters possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Wisdom. Physical abilities are increased by the animal form's
ability modifiers when a lycanthrope changes to its hybrid or animal
forms.

---Size same as the base creature or the base animal form.

---Low-light vision in any form.

---Scent in any form.

---Racial Hit Dice: A lycanthrope adds the Hit Dice of its animal form
to its base Hit Dice for race, level, and class. These additional Hit
Dice modify the lycanthrope's base attack bonus and base saving throw
bonuses accordingly.

---Racial Skills: A lycanthrope adds skill points for its animal Hit
Dice much as if it had multiclassed into the animal type. It gains skill
points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die of the animal
form. Any skills that appear in the animal's description are treated as
class skills for the lycanthrope's animal levels. The lycanthrope's
maximum skill ranks are equal to its animal form Hit Dice + its racial
Hit Dice (if any) + its class levels + 3. Any racial skill adjustments
of the lycanthrope's base race and its animal form (but not conditional
adjustments) are added to its skill modifiers in any form.

---Racial Feats: Add the animal's Hit Dice to the base character's own
Hit Dice to determine how many feats the character has. All lycanthropes
gain Iron Will as a bonus feat.

--- +2 natural armor bonus in any form.

---Special Qualities (see above): Alternate form, lycanthropic empathy,
curse of lycanthropy (in animal or hybrid form only).

---Afflicted lycanthrope: damage reduction 5/silver (in animal or hybrid
form only).

---Natural lycanthrope: damage reduction 10/silver (in animal or hybrid
form only).

---Automatic Languages: As base creature.

---Favored Class: Same as the base creature.

---Level adjustment: Same as the base creature +2 (afflicted) or +3
(natural).

### Control Shape (Wis)

Any character who has contracted lycanthropy and is aware of his
condition can learn Control Shape as a class skill. (An afflicted
lycanthrope not yet aware of his condition can attempt Control Shape
checks untrained.) This skill determines whether an afflicted
lycanthrope can control his shape. A natural lycanthrope does not need
this skill, since it has full control over its shape.

### Check (Involuntary Change)
An afflicted character must make a check
at moonrise each night of the full moon to resist involuntarily assuming
animal form. An injured character must also check for an involuntary
change after accumulating enough damage to reduce his hit points by
one-quarter and again after each additional one-quarter lost.

  --------------------------- ------------------
  Involuntary Change          Control Shape DC
  Resist involuntary change   25
  --------------------------- ------------------

On a failed check, the character must remain in animal form until the
next dawn, when he automatically returns to his base form. A character
aware of his condition may make one attempt to return to humanoid form
(see below), but if he fails, he remains in animal form until the next
dawn.

### Retry (Involuntary Change)
Check to resist an involuntary change
once each time a triggering event occurs.

### Check (Voluntary Change)
In addition, an afflicted lycanthrope
aware of his condition may attempt to use this skill voluntarily in
order to change to animal form, assume hybrid form, or return to
humanoid form, regardless of the state of the moon or whether he has
been injured.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------
  Involuntary Change                                                  Control Shape DC
  Return to humanoid form (full moon\*)                               25
  Return to humanoid form (not full moon)                             20
  Assume hybrid form                                                  15
  Voluntary change to animal form (full moon)                         15
  Voluntary change to animal form (not full moon)                     20
  \* For game purposes, the full moon lasts three days every month.   
  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------

### Retry (Voluntary Change)
A character can retry voluntary changes to
animal form or hybrid form as often as he likes. Each attempt is a
standard action. However, on a failed check to return to humanoid form,
the character must remain in animal or hybrid form until the next dawn,
when he automatically returns to humanoid form.

### Special
An afflicted lycanthrope cannot attempt a voluntary change
until it becomes aware of its condition (see Lycanthropy as an
Affliction).

Magmins are small, human-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire
that radiate intense heat and are wreathed in an aura of searing flames.
A typical magmin is 4 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.

Magmins speak Ignan.

### Combat

Although small, magmins are dangerous opponents. Their touch is
effective against those who lack protection or immunity from heat and
flames, but if faced with opponents who have immunity to fire, magmins
rely on their slam attack. In any case, magmins are not valiant
fighters. They usually flee if injured, although often only far enough
to set up a fiery ambush for their enemies.

A magmin's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combustion (Ex)
Anyone a magmin touches must succeed on a DC 12
Reflex save or take an extra 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes ignite
or armor becomes searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d4+2
rounds after the magmin's last successful attack. Magmins can also
ignite flammable materials with a touch. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

### Fiery Aura (Ex)
Anyone within 20 feet of a magmin must succeed on a
DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of heat damage per round from
the intense heat. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Melt Weapons (Ex)
Any metal weapon that strikes a magmin must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds.
Manticores speak Common.

### Combat

A manticore begins most attacks with a volley of spikes, then closes. In
the outdoors, it often uses its powerful wings to stay aloft during
battle.

### Spikes (Ex)
With a snap of its tail, a manticore can loose a volley
of six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike).
This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets
must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only
twenty-four spikes in any 24-hour period.

### Skills

A medusa is indistinguishable from a normal human at distances greater
than 30 feet (or closer, if its face is concealed). The creature often
wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood
or veil.

A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a
human.

Medusas speak Common.

### Combat

A medusa tries to disguise its true nature until the intended victim is
within range of its petrifying gaze, using subterfuge and bluffing games
to convince the target that there is no danger. It uses normal weapons
to attack those who avert their eyes or survive its gaze, while its
poisonous snakes strike at adjacent opponents.

### Petrifying Gaze (Su)
Turn to stone permanently, 30 feet, Fortitude
DC 15 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Mephit

Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid
features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental
origins are apparent at first glance.

### Combat

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the
nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
A mephit can use its breath weapon once every
1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for
details.

### Spell-Like Abilities
All mephits have one or more spell-like
abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions
for details.

### *Summon Mephit* (Sp)
Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon
another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a *summon
monster* spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a
failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has
just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This
ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

### Fast Healing (Ex)
Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round,
provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See
the individual descriptions for details.

#### Combat

environment.

any kind. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds.

Steam mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Fire.

Steam mephits are bossy creatures who consider themselves the lords of
all their kind. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 2 pounds.

Steam mephits speak Common and Ignan.

#### Combat

Unlike other mephits, steam mephits rush into combat eagerly, driven by
an oversized ego.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
10-foot cone of steam, damage 1d4 fire, Reflex
DC 12 half. Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by
burned skin and seared eyes unless they have immunity to fire or are
otherwise protected. This effect imposes a --4 penalty to AC and a --2
penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based
and includes a +1 racial bonus.

### Spell-Like Abilities
Once per hour a steam mephit can surround
itself with a plume of vapor, duplicating the effect of a *blur* spell
(caster level 3rd). Once per day it can create a rainstorm of boiling
water that affects a 20-foot-square area. Living creatures caught in the
storm take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half; caster level
6th). This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

### Fast Healing (Ex)
A steam mephit heals only if it is touching
boiling water or is in a hot, humid area.

A mimic can have almost any dimensions, but usually is not more than 10
feet long. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5
feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 4,500 pounds.

Mimics speak Common.

### Combat

A mimic often surprises an unsuspecting adventurer, lashing out with a
heavy pseudopod. The creature does not necessarily fight to the death if
it can succeed in extorting treasure or food from a party.

### Adhesive (Ex)
A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful
adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An
adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with
its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic
is alive without removing the adhesive first.

A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the
wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A successful DC 16 Strength
check is needed to pry it off.

Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple
normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance
breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.

### Crush (Ex)
A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful
grapple check.

### Mimic Shape (Ex)
A mimic can assume the general shape of any object
that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as
a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The creature cannot
substantially alter its size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a
rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who
examines the mimic can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check
opposed by the mimic's Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is
generally far too late.

### Skills
A mimic has a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks.

A minotaur stands more than 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.

Minotaurs speak Giant.

### Combat

Minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great strength serves them
well.

### Powerful Charge (Ex)
A minotaur typically begins a battle by
charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty horns
into play. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge,
this allows the beast to make a single gore attack with a +9 attack
bonus that deals 4d6+6 points of damage.

### Natural Cunning (Ex)
Although minotaurs are not especially
intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives
them immunity to *maze* spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost,
and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught
flat-footed.

### Skills

checks.

Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains
who died without atoning for their crimes. Most mohrgs are 5 to 6 feet
tall and weigh about 120 pounds.

### Combat

Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their fists. They
often catch opponents flat-footed, for they move much faster than
zombies.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature
of its size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity.

Mummies are preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark
desert gods best forgotten.

Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.

Mummies can speak Common, but seldom bother to do so.

### Combat

### Despair (Su)
At the mere sight of a mummy, the viewer must succeed
on a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether
or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by
the same mummy's despair ability for 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Mummy Rot (Su)
Supernatural disease---slam, Fortitude DC 16,
incubation period 1 minute; damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot continues until the victim reaches
Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described below.

Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character
attempting to cast any conjuration (healing) spell on a creature
afflicted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or
the spell has no effect on the afflicted character.

To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with *break
enchantment* or *remove curse* (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for
either spell), after which a caster level check is no longer necessary
to cast healing spells on the victim, and the mummy rot can be magically
cured as any normal disease.

An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand and
dust that blow away into nothing at the first wind.

### Mummy Lord

Unusually powerful or evil individuals preserved as mummies sometimes
rise as greater mummies after death. A mummy lord resembles its lesser
fellows, but often wears or carries equipment it used in life.

Mummy lords are often potent spellcasters. They are found as guardians
of the tombs of high lords, priests, and mages. Most are sworn to defend
for eternity the resting place of those whom they served in life, but in
some cases a mummy lord's unliving state is the result of a terrible
curse or rite designed to punish treason, infidelity, or crimes of an
even more abhorrent nature. A mummy lord of this sort is usually
imprisoned in a tomb that is never meant to be opened again.

### Despair (Su)
The save DC against this mummy lord's despair is 17.

### Mummy Rot (Su)
The save DC against this mummy lord's mummy rot is
17.

may have different possessions.)

## Naga

All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales,
and more or less human faces. They range in length from 10 to 20 feet
and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and
intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light.

### Combat

Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost
always found in the lairs they guard and know well, they can arrange
most encounters to suit their wishes.

avoid the effect.

### Spells
Guardian nagas cast spells as 9th-level sorcerers, and can
also cast spells from the cleric list and from the Good and Law domains.

cast them.

Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

night hag can use *etherealness* at will (caster level 16th) so long as
it possesses its *heartstone* (see below). The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Dream Haunting (Su)
Night hags can visit the dreams of chaotic or
evil individuals by using a special periapt known as a *heartstone* to
become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once a hag invades
someone's dreams, it rides on the victim's back until dawn. The sleeper
suffers from tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain
upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal
intrusions, by confronting and defeating the night hag.

### Heartstone

All night hags carry a periapt known as a *heartstone,* which instantly
cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a *heartstone*
provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is
included in the statistics block). A night hag that loses this charm can
no longer use *etherealness* until it can manufacture another (which
takes one month). Creatures other than the hag can benefit from the
*heartstone*'s powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses (any
disease cured or saving throw affected

counts as a use) and it does not bestow *etherealness* to a bearer that
is not a night hag. If sold, an intact *heartstone* brings 1,800 gp.

A nightmare is about the size of a light war horse.

### Combat

A nightmare can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also
fight unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

A nightmare's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Flaming Hooves (Su)
A blow from a nightmare's hooves sets
combustible materials alight.

### Smoke (Su)
During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and
neighs with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot,
sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone
must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a --2 penalty on all
attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The
cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action
during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against
creatures 5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or
farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare's vision at all.

### Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su)
These abilities function
just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare
can use either at will.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a nightmare is up to 300 pounds;
a medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

### Cauchemar

The cauchemar is a horrible, especially malevolent version of a
nightmare. The sight of one of these great horrors bearing down is
enough to shake the heart of the boldest champion.

#### Combat

The save DC for the cauchemar's smoke attack (DC 24) is adjusted for its
greater number of Hit Dice and higher Constitution score.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a cauchemar is up to 612 pounds; a
medium load, 613--1,224 pounds; and a heavy load, 1,225--1,840 pounds.

## Nightshade

Nightshades are powerful undead composed of equal parts darkness and
absolute evil.

Nightshades can read and understand all forms of communication; however,
they communicate with others by telepathy.

### Combat

Each of the three known varieties of nightshade is a terrible creature
with unique powers and abilities. Their tactics vary according to their
abilities, but they all make liberal use of *haste*.

### Nightshade Abilities

All nightshades have the following special abilities.

### Aversion to Daylight (Ex)
If exposed to natural daylight (not
merely a *daylight* spell), nightshades take a --4 penalty on all attack
rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

### Desecrating Aura (Su)
All nightshades give off a 20-footradius
emanation of utter desecration, imbuing their surroundings with negative
energy. This ability works much like a *desecrate* spell, except that
the nightshade's evil is so great that it is treated as the shrine of an
evil power. All undead within 20 feet of the nightshade (including the
creature itself ) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls,
and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The nightshade Hit Dice,
attack, and save entries given here include these profane bonuses.)
Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area take a --6 penalty.

A nightshade's desecrating aura cannot be dispelled except by a *dispel
evil* spell or similar effect. If the effect is dispelled, the
nightshade can resume it as a free action on its next turn. Its
desecrating aura is suppressed if a nightshade enters a *consecrated* or
*hallowed* area, but the nightshade's presence also suppresses the
*consecrated* or *hallowed* effect for as long as it remains in the
area.

A nightcrawler is a massive behemoth similar to a purple worm, though
utterly black in color.

A nightcrawler measures about 7 feet in diameter and is 100 feet long
from its toothy maw to the tip of its stinging tail. It weighs about
55,000 pounds.

#### Combat

A nightcrawler attacks by burrowing through the ground and emerging to
strike.

A nightcrawler's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Energy Drain (Su)
Living creatures inside a nightcrawler's gizzard
gain one negative level each round. The DC is 26 for the Fortitude save
to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

For each such negative level bestowed, the nightcrawler gains 5
temporary hit points.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a nightcrawler must hit
with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent
in the following round.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial and secondary damage
2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*contagion* (DC 18), *deeper
darkness, detect magic, greater dispel magic, haste, invisibility, see
invisibility, unholy blight* (DC 18); 3/day---*cone of cold* (DC 19),
*confusion* (DC 18), *hold monster* (DC 19); 1/day---*finger of death*
(DC 21), *mass hold monster* (DC 23), *plane shift* (DC 21). Caster
level 25th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Summon Undead (Su)
A nightcrawler can summon undead creatures once
per night: 9--16 shadows, 3--6 greater shadows, or 2--4 dread wraiths.
The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.

### Swallow Whole (Ex)
A nightcrawler can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check.
Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus
12 points of acid damage per round from the nightcrawler's gizzard and
is subject to the creature's energy drain. A swallowed creature can cut
its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35
points of damage to the gizzard (AC 21). Once the creature exits,
muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its
own way out. A nightcrawler's interior can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32
Medium, 128 Small, 512 Tiny or smaller opponents.

Nightwalkers are human-shaped horrors that haunt the darkness.

A nightwalker is about 20 feet tall and weighs about 12,000 pounds.

#### Combat

Nightwalkers lurk in dark areas where they can almost always surprise
the unwary.

A nightwalker's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Crush Item (Su)
A nightwalker can destroy any weapon or item of
Large size or smaller (even magic ones, but not artifacts) by picking it
up and crushing it between its hands. The nightwalker must make a
successful disarm attempt to grab an item held by an opponent. The item
is entitled to a DC 34 Fortitude save to resist destruction. The save DC
is Strength-based.

### Evil Gaze (Su)
Fear, 30 feet. A creature that meets the
nightwalker's gaze must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be paralyzed
with fear for 1d8 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that
creature cannot be affected again by the same nightshade's gaze for 24
hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*contagion* (DC 18), *deeper
darkness, detect magic, greater dispel magic, haste, see invisibility,*
and *unholy blight* (DC 18); 3/day---*confusion* (DC 18), *hold monster*
(DC 19), *invisibility;* 1/day---*cone of cold* (DC 19), *finger of
death* (DC 21), *plane shift* (DC 21). Caster level 21st. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

### Summon Undead (Su)
A nightwalker can summon undead creatures once
per night: 7--12 shadows, 2--5 greater shadows, or 1--2 dread wraiths.
The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.

### Skills
\*When hiding in a dark area, a nightwalker gains a +8
racial bonus on Hide checks.

#### Tactics Round-by-Round

The nightwalker is an exceedingly intelligent foe that makes the best
use of all its abilities. It favors using its spell-like abilities to
divide and disable its enemies, then closing to melee with opponents it
has isolated from their allies.

*Prior to combat:* The nightwalker keeps its *see invisibility* power
active most of the time. It uses *haste* and *invisibility* to prepare
for battle.

*Round 1:* Move to within 30 feet to make use of gaze attack and strike
with *confusion* or *hold monster,* coupled with a quickened *unholy
blight.*

*Round 2:* Hit a spellcaster with *finger of death* and another
quickened *unholy blight.*

*Round 3:* Move up to engage the enemy and attempt to disarm an enemy
fighter.

*Round 4:* Crush the disarmed weapon (or use gaze attack if disarm
attempt failed).

*Round 5:* Full attack against the unarmed foe (or on a nearby
spellcaster).

Nightwings are batlike flyers that hunt on the wing.

A nightwing has a wingspan of about 40 feet and weighs about 4,000
pounds.

#### Combat

Nightwings prowl the night sky and dive onto their victims. They are all
but invisible, detectable only because of the stars they obscure in
their passing.

A nightwing's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Magic Drain (Su)
A nightwing can weaken magic armor, weapons, and
shields by making a successful touch attack. The targeted item must
succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or lose 1 point of its enhancement
bonus. The save DC is Charisma-based. An item that loses its entire
enhancement bonus becomes merely a masterwork item and loses any special
abilities (such as flaming) as well. Casting *dispel evil* upon the item
reverses the effect of the magic drain, provided this occurs within a
number of days after the attack equal to the caster's level and the
caster succeeds on a DC 29 caster level check.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*contagion* (DC 18), *deeper
darkness, detect magic, haste, see invisibility, unholy blight* (DC 18);
3/day---*confusion* (DC 18), *greater dispel magic, hold monster* (DC
19), *invisibility;* 1/day---*cone of cold* (DC 19), *finger of death*
(DC 21), *plane shift* (DC 21). Caster level 17th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Summon Undead (Su)
A nightwing can summon undead creatures once per
night: 5--12 shadows, 2--4 greater shadows, or 1 dread wraith. The
undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.

### Skills
\*When hiding in a dark area or flying in a dark sky, a
nightwing gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks.

A nymph is about the height and weight of a female elf.

Nymphs speak Sylvan and Common.

### Combat

### Blinding Beauty (Su)
This ability affects all humanoids within 30
feet of a nymph. Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC
17 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently as though by the *blindness*
spell. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Spell-Like Abilities
1/day---*dimension door.* Caster level 7th.

### Spells
A nymph casts divine spells as a 7th-level druid.

*Typical Druid Spells Prepared* (6/5/4/3/1, save DC 13 + spell level):
0---*cure minor wounds, detect magic, flare, guidance, light,
resistance;* 1st---*calm animal, cure light wounds, entangle,
longstrider, speak with animals;* 2nd---*barkskin, heat metal, lesser
restoration, tree shape;* 3rd--- *call lightning, cure moderate wounds,
protection from energy;* 4th---*rusting grasp.*

### Stunning Glance (Su)
As a standard action, a wrathful nymph can
stun a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target creature must
succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save
DC is Charisma-based.

### Unearthly Grace (Su)
A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus
on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
(The statistics block already reflects these bonuses).

### Wild Empathy (Ex)
This power works like the druid's wild empathy
class feature, except that a nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check.

### Skills
A nymph has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. She can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. She can use the run
action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their
skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing
consists of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally
repellent odor.

Ogres speak Giant, and those specimens who boast Intelligence scores of
at least 10 also speak Common.

### Combat

Ogres favor overwhelming odds, sneak attacks, and ambushes over a fair
fight. They are intelligent enough to fire ranged weapons first to
soften up their foes before closing, but ogre gangs and bands fight as
unorganized individuals.

### Ogre Barbarian

Their inherent bent toward chaos combines with their size and strength
to make ogres natural barbarians. Indeed, their leaders are almost
always barbarians of low to middle level, monstrous brutes whose fury in
battle is truly fearsome. A raging ogre barbarian is an inspiration to
other ogres.

#### Combat

Marginally more intelligent than his brutish fellows, an ogre barbarian
is slightly more likely to enter a fair fight, but in general prefers
the brutish tactics common to all its kind.

### Rage (Ex)
Twice per day, an ogre barbarian can enter a state of
fierce rage that last for 9 rounds. The following changes are in effect
as long as he rages: AC 17 (touch 8, flat-footed 17); hp 95; Atk +18/+13
melee (2d6+16, *+1 greatclub*); SV Fort +14, Will +4; Str 30, Con 22;
Climb +15, Jump +16. At the end of his rage, the ogre barbarian is
fatigued for the duration of the encounter.

### Trap Sense (Ex)
An ogre barbarian has a +1 bonus on Reflex saves
made to avoid traps. He also has a +1 bonus to his AC against attacks by
traps.

### Uncanny Dodge (Ex)
An ogre barbarian retains his Dex bonus to AC
regardless of being caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible
opponent. His Dex bonus to AC is +0, but this means that he is not
subject to a rogue's sneak attack in these circumstances.

### Merrow

These cousins of the ogre have the aquatic subtype.

They dwell in freshwater lakes and rivers. They have a base land speed
of 30 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet and are found only in aquatic
environments.

Instead of the typical ogre's greatclub, they prefer to use longspears
in melee (attack +8 melee, damage 1d8+7).

### Ogres as Characters

The ogre mage is a more intelligent and dangerous variety of its mundane
cousin.

An ogre mage stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 700 pounds. Its
skin varies in color from light green to light blue, and its hair is
black or very dark brown. Ogre mages favor loose, comfortable clothing
and lightweight armor.

Ogre mages speak Giant and Common.

### Combat

Ogre mages rely on their spell-like abilities, resorting to physical
combat only when necessary. When faced with obviously superior forces,
they prefer to retreat using *gaseous form* rather than fight a losing
battle.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*darkness, invisibility;* 1/day---
*charm person* (DC 14)*, cone of cold* (DC 18)*, gaseous form,
polymorph, sleep* (DC 14). Caster level 9th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Flight (Su)
An ogre mage can cease or resume flight as a free
action. While using *gaseous form* it can fly at its normal speed and
has perfect maneuverability.

### Regeneration (Ex)
Fire and acid deal normal damage to an ogre mage.

An ogre mage that loses a limb or body part can reattach it by holding
the severed member to the stump. Reattachment takes 1 minute. If the
head or some other vital organ is severed, it must be reattached within
10 minutes or the creature dies. An ogre mage cannot regrow lost body
parts.

### Ogre Mages as Characters

Ogre mage characters possess the following racial traits.

--- +10 Strength, +6 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +6
Charisma.

---Large size. --1 penalty to Armor Class, --1 penalty on attack rolls,
--4 penalty on Hide checks, +4 bonus on grapple checks, lifting and
carrying limits double those of Medium characters.

---Space/Reach: 10 feet/10 feet.

---An ogre mage's base land speed is 40 feet. It also has a fly speed of

## Ooze

Oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit
underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and
dungeons in search of organic matter---living or dead.

### Combat

Oozes attack any creatures they encounter. They lash out with pseudopods
or simply engulf opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that
help them catch or digest their prey.

### Blindsight (Ex)
An ooze's entire body is a primitive sensory organ
that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.

The typical black pudding measures 15 feet across and 2 feet thick. It
weighs about 18,000 pounds.

#### Combat

A black pudding attacks by grabbing and squeezing their prey.

### Acid (Ex)
The creature secretes a digestive acid that dissolves
organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Any melee
hit or constrict attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's armor and
clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless they succeed on
DC 21 Reflex saves. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a black
pudding also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex
save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

The pudding's acidic touch deals 21 points of damage per round to wooden
or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object
for 1 full round to deal this damage.

### Constrict (Ex)
A black pudding deals automatic slam and acid damage
with a successful grapple check. The opponent's clothing and armor take
a --4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a black pudding must hit
with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Split (Ex)
Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a black
pudding. Instead the creature splits into two identical puddings, each
with half of the original's current hit points (round down). A pudding
with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced
to 0 hit points.

### Skills
A black pudding has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and
can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or
threatened.

### Elder Black Pudding

The most ancient black puddings are vast pools of inky death.

#### Combat

The save DC for the elder black pudding's acid attack (DC 29) is
adjusted for its additional Hit Dice and higher Constitution score.

  ---------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon
corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash.
Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the cube's body.

A typical gelatinous cube is 15 feet on a side and weighs about 50,000
pounds, though much larger specimens are not unknown.

#### Combat

A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It is
capable of lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes.

### Acid (Ex)
A gelatinous cube's acid does not harm metal or stone.

### Engulf (Ex)
Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can simply
mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make
a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube
merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can
cover. Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the cube, but if
they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not
attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex save or be
engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's
choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the
cube's paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped
within its body. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial
bonus.

### Paralysis (Ex)
A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing slime. A
target hit by a cube's melee or engulf attack must succeed on a DC 20
Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can
automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

### Transparent (Ex)
Gelatinous cubes are hard to see, even under ideal
conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who
fail to notice a cube and walk into it are automatically engulfed.

### Gray Ooze

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

A gray ooze can grow to a diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of
about 6 inches. A typical specimen weighs about 700 pounds.

#### Combat

A gray ooze strikes like a snake, slamming opponents with its body.

### Acid (Ex)
A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly
dissolves organic material and metal, but not stone. Any melee hit or
constrict attack deals acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and
becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A
metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze also dissolves
immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. The save DCs are
Constitution-based.

The ooze's acidic touch deals 16 points of damage per round to wooden or
metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1
full round to deal this damage.

### Constrict (Ex)
A gray ooze deals automatic slam and acid damage
with a successful grapple check. The opponent's clothing and armor take
a --4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a gray ooze must hit with
its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Transparent (Ex)
A gray ooze is hard to identify, even under ideal
conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who
fail to notice a gray ooze and walk into it are automatically hit with a
melee attack for slam and acid damage.

An ochre jelly can grow to a diameter of about 15 feet and a thickness
of about 6 inches, but can compress its body to fit into cracks as small
as 1 inch wide. A typical specimen weighs about 5,600 pounds.

#### Combat

An ochre jelly attempts to envelop and squeeze its prey.

### Acid (Ex)

only flesh. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage.

### Constrict (Ex)
An ochre jelly deals automatic slam and acid damage
with a successful grapple check.

### Improved Grab (Ex)

action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Split (Ex)

An orc's hair usually is black. It has lupine ears and reddish eyes.
Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider
unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep
purple. Their equipment is dirty and unkempt. An adult male orc is a
little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds.

Females are slightly smaller.

The language an orc speaks varies slightly from tribe to tribe, but any
orc is understandable by someone else who speaks Orc. Some orcs know
Goblin or Giant as well.

Most orcs encountered away from their homes are warriors; the
information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.

### Combat

Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that cause
the most damage in the least time. Many orcs who take up the warrior or
fighter class also gain proficiency with the falchion or the greataxe as
a martial weapon. They enjoy attacking from concealment and setting
ambushes, and they obey the rules of war (such as honoring a truce) only
as long as it is convenient for them.

### Light Sensitivity (Ex)
Orcs are dazzled in bright sunlight or
within the radius of a *daylight* spell.

### Orcs as Characters

### Orc Traits (Ex)

The orc warrior presented here had the following ability scores before
racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### Half-Orcs

These orc--human crossbreeds can be found in either orc or human society
(where their status varies according to local sentiments), or in
communities of their own. Half-orcs usually inherit a good blend of the
physical characteristics of their parents. They are as tall as humans
and a little heavier, thanks to their muscle. They have greenish
pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and
coarse body hair. Half-orcs who have lived among or near orcs have
scars, in keeping with orcish tradition.

### Half-Orc Traits (Ex)
Half-orcs possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Strength, --2 Intelligence, --2 Charisma.

Giant owls are nocturnal birds of prey, feared for their ability to hunt
and attack in near silence. They are intelligent, and though naturally
suspicious, sometimes associate with good creatures. A typical giant owl
stands about 9 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and resembles
its smaller cousins in nearly every way except size.

Giant owls speak Common and Sylvan.

### Combat

A giant owl attacks by gliding silently just a few feet above its prey
and plunging to strike when directly overhead.

### Superior Low-Light Vision (Ex)
A giant owl can see five times as
far as a human can in dim light.

### Skills
Giant owls have a +8 racial bonus on Listen checks and a +4
racial bonus on Spot checks.

\*When in flight, giant owls gain a +8 bonus on Move Silently checks.

### Training a Giant Owl

Although intelligent, a giant owl requires training before it can bear a
rider in combat. To be trained, a giant owl must have a friendly
attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful
Diplomacy check). Training a friendly giant owl requires six weeks of
work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a giant owl requires an
exotic saddle. A giant owl can fight while carrying a rider, but the
rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Giant owl eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while
chicks are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to
rear or train a giant owl.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a giant owl is up to 300 pounds;
a medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

An owlbear's coat ranges in color from brown-black to yellowish brown;
its beak is a dull ivory color. A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8
feet and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Adventurers who have survived
encounters with the creature often speak of the bestial madness they
glimpsed in its red-rimmed eyes.

### Combat

Owlbears attack prey---any creature bigger than a mouse---on sight,
always fighting to the death. They slash with claws and beak, trying to
grab their prey and rip it apart.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, an owlbear must hit with a
claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity.

The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the
cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild
and shy creatures not easily tamed.

A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500
pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Pegasi cannot speak, but they
understand Common.

### Combat

within a 60-foot radius. Caster level 5th.

### Skills
Pegasi have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

### Training a Pegasus

Although intelligent, a pegasus requires training before it can bear a
rider in combat. To be trained, a pegasus must have a friendly attitude
toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy
check). Training a friendly pegasus requires six weeks of work and a DC
25 Handle Animal check. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle. A
pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also
attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Pegasus eggs are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are
worth 3,000 gp per head. Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses.
Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which
serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a
medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a cluster
of nodules atop the main mass, though it is visible only when dead. A
cluster of nodules atop the main mass serve as sensory organs. The
creature feeds and attacks with a gaping maw lined with rows of teeth.
Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it to move about. This
ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared predator
among subterranean inhabitants.

### Combat

A phantom fungus usually roams quietly, hunting for prey. It attacks
lone individuals almost anywhere, but when tackling groups it prefers an
open space where it has a better chance .

### Greater Invisibility (Su)
This ability is constant, allowing a
phantom fungus to remain invisible even when attacking. It works like
*greater invisibility* (caster level 12th) and lasts as long as the
phantom fungus is alive. This ability is not subject to the
*invisibility purge* spell. A phantom fungus becomes visible 1 minute
after it is killed.

### Skills
A phantom fungus has a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently
checks.

Phase spiders are aggressive predators that can move quickly from the
Ethereal Plane to attack opponents on the Material Plane.

A typical phase spider's body is 8 feet long. It weighs about 700
pounds.

Phase spiders cannot speak.

### Combat

Phase spiders dwell and hunt on the Material Plane. Once a spider
locates prey, however, it shifts to the Ethereal Plane to attack,
attempting to catch its victim flat-footed. The spider shifts in, bites
its victim, and retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane.

### Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
A phase spider can shift from the Ethereal
Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a
move action (or during a move action). The ability is otherwise
identical with *ethereal jaunt* (caster level 15th).

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage
1d8 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Skills
A phase spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

A phasm is an amorphous creature that can assume the guise of almost any
other creature or object. A phasm in its natural form is about 5 feet in
diameter and 2 feet high at the center. Swirls of color indicate sensory
organs. In this form, a phasm slithers about like an ooze and can attack
with a pseudopod. It weighs about 400 pounds.

Phasms can speak Common but prefer telepathic communication.

### Combat

When faced with potential danger, a phasm is equally likely to retreat,
parley, or attack, as its fancy strikes.

If pursued or harassed, a phasm transforms into the most fearsome
creature it knows and attacks. When seriously hurt, it changes to some
fast or agile form and tries to escape.

### Amorphous (Ex)
A phasm in its natural form has immunity to poison,
*sleep,* paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. It is not subject
to critical hits and, having no clear front or back, cannot be flanked.

### Resilient (Ex)
A phasm has a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude and
Reflex saves (included in the statistics block).

Alternate Form (Su): A phasm can assume any form of Large size or
smaller as a standard action. This ability functions as a *polymorph*
spell cast on itself (caster level 15th), except that the phasm does not
regain hit points for changing form. A phasm can remain in its alternate
form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.

### Tremorsense (Ex)
A phasm can automatically sense the location of
anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground, so long as
it is touching the ground itself.

### Skills
\*When using shapechange, a phasm gains a +10 circumstance
bonus on Disguise checks.

## Planetouched

Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can trace his or
her bloodline back to an outsider, usually a fiend or celestial.

The effects of having a supernatural being in one's heritage last for
many generations. Although not as dramatically altered as a
half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special
qualities.

The two planetouched varieties described here are the most common.
Aasimars are humans with some trace of celestial blood in their veins,
and tieflings have some fiendishness in their family tree.

Aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and generally pleasant. Some
have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as silver
hair, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare.

Most aasimars are decidedly good-aligned. They fight against evil causes
and attempt to sway others to do the right thing. Occasionally they take
on the vengeful, judgmental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this
is rare.

#### Combat

Aasimars usually like a fair, straightforward contest. Against a
particularly evil foe, however, they fight with utter conviction and to
the death.

1^st^-level caster or a caster of his class levels, whichever is higher.

vibration and other environmental clues). Opponents the pseudodragon
can't actually see still have total concealment against the
pseudodragon.

### Telepathy (Su)
Pseudodragons can communicate telepathically with
creatures that speak Common or Sylvan, provided they are within 60 feet.

The body of a mature purple worm is 5 feet in diameter and 80 feet long,
weighing about 40,000 pounds. The creature has a poisonous stinger in
its tail.

### Combat

In battle, a purple worm forms into a coil 20 feet in diameter, biting
and stinging anything within reach.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a purple worm must hit with
its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can attempt to swallow the foe the
following round.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 25, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Swallow Whole (Ex)
A purple worm can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of a smaller size than itself by making a successful grapple
check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of crushing damage
plus 8 points of acid damage per round from the worm's gizzard. A
swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or
piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 17). Once
the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan worm's interior can hold
2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller
opponents.

### Skills
A purple worm has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands are
where the backs of the hands would be on a human.

A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human.

Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon.

### Combat

In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its
sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever possible, it uses its other
abilities to make such encounters unnecessary.

### Detect Thoughts (Su)
A rakshasa can continuously use detect
thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can
suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Spells
A rakshasa casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.

*Typical Sorcerer Spells Known* (6/7/7/5; save DC 13 + spell level):
0---*detect magic, light, mage hand, message, read magic, resistance,
touch of fatigue;* 1st---*charm person, mage armor, magic missile,
shield, silent image;* 2nd---*bear's endurance, invisibility, acid
arrow;* 3rd---*haste, suggestion.*

### Change Shape (Su)
A rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or
revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a
rakshasa loses its claw and bite attacks (although it often equips
itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains in one form
until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be
dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form when killed. A
*true seeing* spell reveals its natural form.

### Skills
A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise
checks. \*When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10
circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If reading an opponent's mind,
its circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by a
further +4.

### Rakshasas as Characters

Rakshasa characters possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2
Wisdom, +6 Charisma.

---Medium size.

---A rakshasa's base land speed is 40 feet.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Racial Hit Dice: A rakshasa begins with seven levels of outsider,
which provide 7d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +7, and base saving
throw bonuses of Fort +5, Ref +5, and Will +5.

---Racial Skills: A rakshasa's outsider levels give it skill points
equal to 10 x (8 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Bluff, Disguise,
Listen, Move Silently, Perform, Sense Motive, and Spot. A rakshasa has a
+4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks, and it can gain further
bonuses by using change shape (+10 on Disguise checks) and detect
thoughts (+4 on Bluff and Disguise checks).

---Racial Feats: A rakshasa's outsider levels give it three feats.

--- +9 natural armor bonus.

---Natural Weapons: Bite (1d6) and 2 claws (1d4).

---Detect Thoughts (Su): The save DC is 13 + the character's Cha
modifier.

---Spells: A rakshasa character casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer. If
the character takes additional levels of sorcerer, these levels stack
with the rakshasa's base spellcasting ability for spells known, spells
per day, and other effects dependent on caster level. A rakshasa
character likewise uses the sum of its

racial spellcasting levels and class levels to determine the abilities
of its familiar.

---Special Qualities (see above): Change shape, damage reduction 15/good
and piercing, spell resistance equal to 27 + class levels.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Infernal. Bonus Languages: Sylvan,
Undercommon.

---Favored Class: Sorcerer.

---Level adjustment +7.

A rast has anywhere from ten to fifteen claws, though it can only use
four at once.

A rast has a body about the size of a large dog's, with a head almost as
large as the body. It weighs about 200 pounds.

### Combat

are still moving. A rast can claw or bite, but cannot do both during the
same round.

### Paralyzing Gaze (Su)
Paralysis for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude
DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a rast must hit with its
bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Blood Drain (Ex)
A rast drains blood from a grabbed opponent,
dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round it maintains the hold.

### Flight (Su)

(either a move action or an attack action) each round.

Ravids are creatures from the Positive Energy Plane. These bizarre
entities imbue creatures with energy by their touch and animate lifeless
objects around them. Ravids that make their way to the Material Plane
wander about aimlessly, followed by the objects to which they have given
life.

A ravid is about 7 feet long and weighs about 75 pounds.

### Combat

Ravids fight only in self-defense. A ravid itself is not very powerful
but is always accompanied by at least one animated object that defends
it.

### Positive Energy Lash (Su)
A ravid can make a touch attack or hit
with a claw or tail slap attack to infuse a target with positive energy.
The energy produces an unpleasant tingle in living creatures, and
against undead foes (even incorporeal ones) it deals 2d10 points of
damage.

Animate Objects (Su): Once per round, a random object within 20 feet of
a ravid animates as though by the spell *animate objects* (caster level
20th). These objects defend the ravid to the best of their ability, but
the ravid isn't intelligent enough to employ elaborate tactics with
them.

### Flight (Su)
A ravid can cease or resume flight as a free action. A
rast that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action
(either a move action or an attack action) each round.

### Feats
A ravid has the Multiattack feat even through it does not
have the requisite three natural weapons.

A remorhaz is whitish-blue in color but pulses with a reddish glow from
the heat its body produces. The creature is a little more than 20 feet
long, with a body about 5 feet wide. It weighs about 10,000 pounds.

Remorhazes cannot speak.

### Combat

Remorhazes hide under the snow and ice until they hear movement above
them, then attack from below and surprise prey.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a remorhaz must hit an
opponent least one size category smaller than itself with its bite
attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and can attempt to swallow the opponent the following
round.

### Swallow Whole (Ex)
When a remorhaz begins its turn with a grappled
opponent in its mouth, it can swallow that opponent with a successful
grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of
bludgeoning damage plus 8d6 points of fire damage per round from the
remorhaz's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a
light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the
gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the
hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge
remorhaz's interior can hold 2 Large, 4 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, 128
Diminutive, or 512 Fine or smaller opponents.

### Heat (Ex)
An enraged remorhaz generates heat so intense that
anything touching its body takes 8d6 points of fire damage. Creatures
striking a remorhaz with natural attacks or unarmed attacks are subject
to this damage, but creatures striking with melee weapons do not take
damage from the remorhaz's heat. This heat can melt or char weapons; any
weapon that strikes a remorhaz is allowed a DC 18 Fortitude save to
avoid destruction. The save DC is Constitution-based. Skills: Remorhazes
have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.

A roc's plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. These
enormous creatures are 30 feet long from the beak to the base of the
tail, with wingspans as wide as 80 feet. A roc weighs about 8,000
pounds.

### Combat

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its
powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. A
solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any Medium or larger
creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert,
fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings.

### Skills
Rocs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A roper stands some 9 feet tall and tapers from 3 or 4 feet in diameter
at the base to 1 foot across at the top. It weighs 2,200 pounds. A
roper's coloration and temperature change to match the features of the
surrounding cave.

Ropers speak Terran and Undercommon.

### Combat

A roper hunts by standing very still and imitating a bit of rock. This
tactic often allows it to attack with surprise. When prey comes within
reach, it lashes out with its strands. In melee, it bites adjacent
opponents with its powerful maw.

### Drag (Ex)
If a roper hits with a strand attack, the strand latches
onto the opponent's body. This deals no damage but drags the stuck
opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of
opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which requires a DC 23
Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check. The check DCs are
Strength-based, and the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial bonus. A
roper can draw in a creature within 10 feet of itself and bite with a +4
attack bonus in the same round. A strand has 10 hit points and can be
attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a
roper's strand does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the strand
is currently attached to a target, the roper takes a --4 penalty on its
opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a strand
deals no damage to a roper.

### Strands (Ex)
Most encounters with a roper begin when it fires
strong, sticky strands. The creature can have up to six strands at once,
and they can strike up to 50 feet away (no range increment). If a strand
is severed, the roper can extrude a new one on its next turn as a free
action.

### Weakness (Ex)
A roper's strands can sap an opponent's strength.
Anyone grabbed by a strand must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or
take 2d8 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Skills
\*Ropers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in stony or
icy areas.

The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan
underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust monster's prehensile antennae
can rust metals on contact.

The typical rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high, weighing
200 pounds.

### Combat

A rust monster can scent a metal object from up to 90 feet away. When it
detects one, it dashes toward the source and attempts to strike it with
its antennae. The creature is relentless, chasing characters over long
distances if they still possess intact metal objects but usually ceasing
its attacks to devour a freshly rusted meal.

The creature targets the largest metal object available, striking first
at armor, then at shields and smaller items. It prefers ferrous metals
(steel or iron) over precious metals (such as gold or silver) but will
devour the latter if given the opportunity.

### Rust (Ex)
A rust monster that makes a successful touch attack with
its antennae causes the target metal to corrode, falling to pieces and
becoming useless immediately. The touch can destroy up to a 10-foot cube
of metal instantly. Magic armor and weapons, and other magic items made
of metal, must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or be dissolved. The save
DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.

A metal weapon that deals damage to a rust monster corrodes immediately.
Wooden, stone, and other nonmetallic weapons are unaffected.

Most sahuagin feature green coloration, darker along the back and
lighter on the belly. Many have dark stripes, bands, or spots, but these
tend to fade with age. An adult male sahuagin stands roughly 6 feet tall
and weighs about 200 pounds.

Sahuagin are the natural enemy of aquatic elves. The two cannot coexist
peacefully: Wars between them are prolonged, bloody affairs that
sometimes interfere with shipping and maritime trade. Sahuagin have an
only slightly less vehement hatred for tritons.

Sahuagin speak their own language, Sahuagin. Thanks to their high
Intelligence scores, most sahuagin also speak two bonus languages,
usually Common and Aquan.

### Combat

Sahuagin are savage fighters, asking for and giving no quarter. When
swimming, a sahuagin tears with its feet as it strikes with its talons
or a weapon. About half of any group of sahuagin are also armed with
nets.

### Blindsense (Ex)
A sahuagin can locate creatures underwater within a
30-foot radius. This ability works only when the sahuagin is underwater.

### Blood Frenzy
Once per day a sahuagin that takes damage in combat
can fly into a frenzy in the following round, clawing and biting madly
until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +2 Constitution and +2
Strength, and takes a --2 penalty to Armor Class. A sahuagin cannot end
its frenzy voluntarily.

### Rake (Ex)
Attack bonus +2 melee, damage 1d4+1. A sahuagin also
gains two rake attacks when it attacks while swimming.

### Freshwater Sensitivity (Ex)
A sahuagin fully immersed in fresh
water must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Even on
a success, it must repeat the save attempt every 10 minutes it remains
immersed.

### Light Blindness (Ex)
Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as
sunlight or a *daylight* spell) blinds sahuagin for round. On subsequent
rounds, they are dazzled while operating in bright light.

### Speak with Sharks (Ex)
Sahuagin can communicate telepathically with
sharks up to 150 feet away. The communication is limited to fairly
simple concepts such as "food," "danger," and "enemy." Sahuagin can use
the Handle Animal skill to befriend and train sharks.

### Water Dependent (Ex)
Sahuagin can survive out of the water for 1
hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning
rules on page 304 of the *Dungeon Master 's Guide*).

### Skills
A sahuagin has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

\*Underwater, a sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot
checks.

\*A sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Survival and Profession (hunter)
checks within 50 miles of its home.

\*A sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks when working
with sharks.

### Sahuagin Mutants

About one in two hundred sahuagin has four arms. Such creatures can make
four claw attacks or use extra weapons, in addition to the claw and bite
attacks.

If a community of aquatic elves is located within 100 miles of a
sahuagin community, about one in one hundred sahuagin looks just like an
aquatic elf. These creatures, called malenti, have a swim speed of 40
feet, can remain out of water for 1 hour per point of Constitution, and
have freshwater sensitivity and light sensitivity (dazzled in bright
light). Malenti have no natural attacks. They are otherwise identical
with sahuagin.

Salamanders speak Ignan. Some average salamanders and all nobles also
speak Common.

### Combat

If a salamander has damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Constrict (Ex)
A salamander deals automatic tail slap damage
(including fire damage) with a successful grapple check. A noble
salamander can constrict multiple creatures simultaneously, provided
they are all at least two sizes smaller than it.

### Heat (Ex)
A salamander generates so much heat that its mere touch
deals additional fire damage. Salamanders' metallic weapons also conduct
this heat.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a salamander must hit a
creature of up to one size larger than itself with its tail slap attack.
It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Spell-Like Abilities
(Noble salamanders only) 3/day---*burning
hands* (DC 13), *fireball* (DC 15), *flaming sphere* (DC 14), *wall of
fire* (DC 16); 1/day---*dispel magic, summon monster VII* (Huge fire
elemental). Caster level 15th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Skills
Salamanders have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (blacksmithing)
checks.

### Feats
Salamanders have the Multiattack feat even though they do not
have the requisite three natural weapons.

A satyr's hair is red or chestnut brown, while its hooves and horns are
jet black. A satyr is about as tall and heavy as a half-elf.

Satyrs speak Sylvan, and most also speak Common.

### Combat

The keen senses of a satyr make it almost impossible to surprise one in
the wild. Conversely, with their own natural grace and agility, satyrs
can sneak up on travelers who are not carefully watching the surrounding
wilderness. Once engaged in battle, an unarmed satyr attacks with a
powerful head butt. A satyr expecting trouble is likely to be armed with
a bow and a dagger and typically looses arrows from hiding, weakening an
enemy before closing.

### Pipes (Su)
Satyrs can play a variety of magical tunes on their pan
pipes. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries pipes. When it plays,
all creatures within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs) must succeed on a
DC 13 Will save or be affected by *charm person, sleep,* or *fear*
(caster level 10th; the satyr chooses the tune and its effect).

In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers. A
creature that successfully saves against any of the pipe's effects
cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Skills
Satyrs have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, Perform, and Spot checks.

### Satyrs as Characters

Satyr characters possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2
Charisma.

---Medium size.

---A satyr's base land speed is 40 feet.

---Racial Hit Dice: A satyr begins with five levels of fey, which
provide 5d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw
bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4.

---Racial Skills: A satyr's fey levels give it skill points equal to 8 x
(6 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Bluff, Hide, Knowledge
(nature), Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot. Satyrs have a +4
racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot checks.

---Racial Feats: A satyr's fey levels give it two feats. A satyr

A typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.

### Combat

Sea cats attack on sight, either for food or to defend their territory,
and use both claws and teeth to grab and rend their prey. They display
tremendous courage, always fighting to the death, even against creatures
many times their size. Pairs and prides of sea cats attack in concert,
trying to wear the opponent down until one beast can dispatch it.

### Hold Breath (Ex)
A sea cat can hold its breath for a number of
rounds equal to 6  its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

### Rend (Ex)
A sea cat that hits with both claw attacks latches onto
the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This automatically deals an
extra 2d6+6 points of damage.

### Skills
A sea cat has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but stands out
starkly in brightly illuminated places.

A shadow is 5 to 6 feet tall and is weightless. Shadows cannot speak
intelligibly.

### Combat

Shadows lurk in dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by.

### Strength Damage (Su)
The touch of a shadow deals 1d6 points of
Strength damage to a living foe. A creature reduced to Strength 0 by a
shadow dies. This is a negative energy effect.

### Create Spawn (Su)
Any humanoid reduced to Strength 0 by a shadow
becomes a shadow under the control of its killer within 1d4 rounds.

### Skills
Shadows have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks and
a +4 racial bonus on Search checks. \*A shadow gains a +4 racial bonus
on Hide checks in areas of shadowy illumination. In brightly lit areas,
it takes a --4 penalty on Hide checks.

### Greater Shadow

Although no more intelligent than an average shadow, a greater shadow is
more fearsome because of its increased damage and its hit-and-run
tactics.

#### Combat

### Strength Damage (Su)
The touch of a greater shadow deals 1d8 points
of Strength damage to a living foe.

This creature has the body of a large dog, with a smooth black coat and
a mouth full of sharp teeth.

A shadow mastiff is slightly more than 2 feet high at the shoulder and
weighs about 200 pounds.

Shadow mastiffs cannot speak, but they understand Common.

### Combat

Shadow mastiffs prefer fighting in shadows or dark conditions, which
gives them a great advantage.

If a magical light source negates the shadows around them, shadow
mastiffs are cunning enough to either move out of the light or back off
and break up the opposition with their baying. They have been known to
seize and carry off items enspelled with *daylight* spells.

### Bay (Su)
When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures except
evil outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will
save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting
fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature
is immune to the same mastiff 's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Trip (Ex)
A shadow mastiff that hits with its bite attack can
attempt to trip the opponent as a free action (+3 check modifier)
without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If
the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the shadow mastiff.

### Shadow Blend (Su)
In any condition of illumination other than full
daylight, a shadow mastiff can disappear into the shadows, giving it
total concealment. Artificial illumination, even a *light* or *continual
flame* spell, does not negate this ability. A *daylight* spell, however,
will.

### Skills
\*A shadow mastiff has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks
when tracking by scent.

Shambling mounds, also called shamblers, appear to be heaps of rotting
vegetation. They are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants.

A shambler's brain and sensory organs are located in its upper body.

A shambler's body has an 8-foot girth and is about 6 feet tall when the
creature stands erect. It weighs about 3,800 pounds.

### Combat

A shambling mound batters or constricts its opponents with two huge,
armlike appendages.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a shambler must hit with
both slam attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

### Constrict (Ex)
A shambler deals 2d6+7 points of damage with a
successful grapple check.

### Immunity to Electricity (Ex)
Shamblers take no damage from
electricity. Instead, any electricity attack used against a shambler
temporarily grants it 1d4 points of Constitution. The shambler loses
these points at the rate of 1 per hour.

Skills: Shamblers have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Move
Silently checks. \*They have a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks when in a
swampy or forested area.

Created by spellcasters to be bodyguards, shield guardians are
constructs that protect their masters with spells and stamina. When it
is fashioned, a shield guardian is keyed to a particular magical amulet.
Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet to be its master,
protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically
commanded not to do so).

A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its
ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat and possibly
simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at
specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the
amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come
as long as it is on the same plane.

A shield guardian is some 9 feet tall and weighs more than 1,200 pounds.

Shield guardians cannot speak, but they understand commands given in any
language.

### Combat

Shield guardians are straightforward in battle, bashing with their heavy
stone fists. They are made for defense and are not particularly
impressive on offense.

### Find Master (Su)
As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on
the same plane, the shield guardian can find the amulet wearer (or just
the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).

### Guard (Ex)
If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves swiftly to
defend the wearer of its amulet, blocking blows and disrupting foes. All
attacks against the amulet wearer take a --2 penalty when the shield
guardian is adjacent to its master.

### *Shield Other* (Sp)
The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can
activate this defensive ability if within 100 feet of the shield
guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to
the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet
wearer (this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses).

### *Spell Storing* (Sp)
A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th
level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this
spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises.
Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or
the same spell again).

### Construction

A shield guardian is built from wood, bronze, stone, and steel. The
materials cost 5,000 gp.

The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do
the job. Creating the body requires a DC 16 Craft (blacksmithing) or
Craft (carpentry) check. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time,
and its cost (20,000 gp) is included in the cost of the guardian. After
the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an
extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or
workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to
establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's
body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. A shield
guardian with more than 15 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional
Hit Die adds +5,000 gp to the market price, and the price increases by
+20,000 gp if the creature's size increases to Huge, modifying the cost
to create accordingly.

CL 15th; Craft Construct, *limited wish, discern location, shield,
shield other,* caster must be at least 15th level; Price 120,000 gp;
Cost 65,000 gp + 4,600 XP.

### Amulet

If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to
function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet
is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was
given.

A shocker lizard has a pale gray or blue underside, shading to a darker
hue on its back. It has blue-black markings along its back and tail. A
shocker lizard is about 1 foot tall at the shoulder and weighs about 25
pounds.

### Combat

A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat. A lizard
tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious
or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard
flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are
nearby, they all home in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to
administer their shocks to the foe.

### Stunning Shock (Su)
Once per round, a shocker lizard can deliver an
electrical shock to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals
2d8 points of nonlethal damage to living opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ).
The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Lethal Shock (Su)
Whenever two or more shocker lizards are within
20 feet of each other, they can work together to create a lethal shock.
This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any one contributing
lizard. The shock deals 2d8 points of electricity damage for each lizard
contributing to it, to a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save (DC 10 + number
of lizards contributing) reduces the damage by half.

### Electricity Sense (Ex)
Shocker lizards automatically detect any
electrical discharges within 100 feet.

### Skills
Shocker lizards have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks due to
their coloration. Shocker lizards have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and
Spot checks.

Shocker lizards use their Dexterity modifier instead of their Strength
modifier for Climb and Jump checks.

A shocker lizard has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always
choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

A shocker lizard has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some
special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a
Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action
while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

## Skeleton

Skeletons are the animated bones of the dead, mindless automatons that
obey the orders of their evil masters.

A skeleton is seldom garbed in anything more than the rotting remnants
of any clothing or armor it was wearing when slain. A skeleton does only
what it is ordered to do. It can draw no conclusions of its own and
takes no initiative. Because of this limitation, its instructions must
always be simple. A skeleton attacks until destroyed.

### Creating a Skeleton

"Skeleton" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal
creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to
hereafter as the base creature).

### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any
subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that
indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the
base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

### Hit Dice
Drop any Hit Dice gained from class levels (to a minimum
of 1) and raise remaining Hit Dice to d12s. If the creature has more
than 20 Hit Dice, it can't be made into a skeleton by the *animate dead*
spell.

### Speed
Winged skeletons can't use their wings to fly. If the base
creature flew magically, so can the skeleton.

### Armor Class
Natural armor bonus changes to a number based on the
skeleton's size:

  ----------------- -----
  Tiny or smaller   +0
  Small             +1
  Medium or Large   +2
  Huge              +3
  Gargantuan        +6
  Colossal          +10
  ----------------- -----

### Attacks
A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, manufactured
weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except
for attacks that can't work without flesh. A creature with hands gains
one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw
attacks at its full attack bonus. A skeleton's base attack bonus is
equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice.

### Damage
Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A
claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton's size. (If the base
creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the skeleton claw
damage only if it's better.)

  -------------------- -----
  Diminutive or Fine   1
  Tiny                 1d2
  Small                1d3
  Medium               1d4
  Large                1d6
  Huge                 1d8
  Gargantuan           2d6
  Colossal             2d8
  -------------------- -----

### Special Attacks
A skeleton retains none of the base creature's
special attacks.

### Special Qualities
A skeleton loses most special qualities of the
base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that
improve its melee or ranged attacks. A skeleton gains the following
special qualities.

*Immunity to Cold (Ex):* Skeletons are not affected by cold.

*Damage Reduction 5/Bludgeoning:* Skeletons lack flesh or internal
organs.

### Saves
Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will
+1/2 HD + 2.

### Abilities
A skeleton's Dexterity increases by +2, it has no
Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its
Charisma changes to 1.

### Skills
A skeleton has no skills.

### Feats
A skeleton loses all feats of the base creature and gains
Improved Initiative.

### Environment
Any, usually same as base creature.

### Organization
Any.

### Challenge Rating
Depends on Hit Dice, as follows:

  ---------- ------------------
  Hit Dice   Challenge Rating
  1/2        1/6
  1          1/3
  2--3       1
  4--5       2
  6--7       3
  8--9       4
  10--11     5
  12--14     6
  15--17     7
  18--20     8
  ---------- ------------------

### Treasure
None.

### Alignment
Always neutral evil.

### Advancement
As base creature (or --- if the base creature advances
by character class).

### Level Adjustment
---.

A spectre looks much as it did in life and can be easily recognized by
those who knew the individual or have seen the individual's face in a
painting or a drawing. In many cases, the evidence of a violent death is
visible on its body. A spectre is roughly human-sized and is weightless.

### Combat

In close combat a spectre attacks with its numbing, life-draining touch.
It makes full use of its incorporeal nature, moving through walls,
ceilings, and floors as it attacks.

### Energy Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a spectre's incorporeal
touch attack gain two negative levels. The DC is 15 for the Fortitude
save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each
such negative level bestowed, the spectre gains 5 temporary hit points.

### Create Spawn (Su)
Any humanoid slain by a spectre becomes a spectre
in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the spectre that created
them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the
abilities they had in life.

### Unnatural Aura (Su)
Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can
sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They
do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so;
they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.

### Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
Spectres are powerless in natural
sunlight (not merely a *daylight* spell) and flee from it. A spectre
caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move or
attack action in a round.

## Sphinx

Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine
bodies. All sphinxes are territorial, but the more intelligent ones can
differentiate between deliberate intrusion and temporary or inadvertent
trespass.

A typical sphinx is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.

Sphinxes speak Sphinx, Common, and Draconic.

### Combat

Most sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help them pounce
much as lions do. If outnumbered by earthbound creatures, a sphinx takes
wing and attacks on the fly.

### Pounce (Ex)
If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a full attack,
including two rake attacks.

### Rake (Ex)
A sphinx that pounces onto a creature can make two rake
attacks with its hind legs. Each sphinx's description provides its
attack bonus and damage.

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These sphinxes are always male. Androsphinxes are clever and generally
good-natured, but they can be savage opponents.

#### Combat

In battle, an androsphinx rips apart enemies with its razor-sharp claws.
It relies on its natural weapons in a fight, employing its spells for
defense or healing.

### Rake (Ex)
Attack bonus +18 melee, damage 2d4+3.

### Roar (Su)
Three times per day an androsphinx can loose a mighty
roar. The first time it does this, all creatures within 500 feet must
succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell
for 2d6 rounds.

If the sphinx roars a second time during the same encounter, all
creatures within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be
paralyzed for 1d4 rounds, and all those within 90 feet are deafened for
2d6 rounds (no save). If it roars a third time during the same
encounter, all those within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude
save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage for 2d4 rounds. In addition,
any Medium or smaller creature within 90 feet must succeed on a DC 19
Fortitude save or be thrown to the ground and take 2d8 points of damage.
The force of this roar is so great that it deals 50 points of damage to
any stone or crystalline object within 90 feet. Magic items and held or
carried items can avoid damage with a DC 19 Reflex save. Other
androsphinxes are immune to these effects. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

### Spells
An androsphinx casts divine spells as a 6th-level cleric
from the cleric spell list and from the Good, Healing, and Protection
domains.

*Typical Cleric Spells Prepared* (5/5/5/4; save DC 13 + spell level):
0---*cure minor wounds, detect magic, guidance, light, resistance;*
1st---*divine favor, protection from evil\*, shield of faith, remove
fear, summon monster I;* 2nd---*bull's strength, remove paralysis,
resist energy, shield other\*, summon monster II;* 3rd---*cure serious
wounds\*, daylight, invisibility purge, searing light.*

\*Domain spell. Domains: Good and Healing.

intelligence of the androsphinx.

butt with their horns. They don't cast spells and employ only the most
simple battle tactics.

A spider eater is about 10 feet long and 4 feet high, and has a wingspan
of about 20 feet. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.

### Combat

A spider eater attacks with its venomous sting and powerful mandibles.
Its usual tactic is to deliver a sting, then back off, hovering out of
reach until the venom takes effect.

### Implant (Ex)
Female spider eaters lay their eggs inside paralyzed
creatures of Large or larger size. The young emerge about six weeks
later, literally devouring the host from inside.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial damage none, secondary
damage paralysis for 1d8+5 weeks. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Freedom of Movement (Su)
Spider eaters have a continuous freedom of
movement ability as the spell (caster level 12th). When the spider eater
serves as a mount, this effect does not extend to its rider.

### Skills
Spider eaters have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

### Training a Spider Eater

A spider eater requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.

Training a spider eater requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle
Animal check. Riding a spider eater requires an exotic saddle. A spider
eater can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack
unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Spider eater eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market, while
young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 3,000 gp to
rear or train a spider eater.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a spider eater is up to 306
pounds; a medium load, 307--612 pounds; and a heavy load, 613--920
pounds.

## Sprite

Sprites are reclusive fey. They go out of their way to fight evil and
ugliness and to protect their homelands.

### Combat

Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like abilities and pintsized
weaponry. They prefer ambushes and other trickery over direct
confrontation.

### Skills
All sprites have a +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and
Listen checks.

Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green skin
and dark green hair. Females often twine shells and pearl strings in
their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Males wear
loincloths of the same materials. Nixies prefer not to leave their
lakes.

A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds.

Nixies speak Aquan and Sylvan. Some also speak Common.

#### Combat

Nixies rely on their *charm person* ability to deter enemies, entering
combat only to protect themselves and their territory.

### *Charm Person* (Sp)
A nixie can use *charm person* three times per
day as the spell (caster level 4th). Those affected must succeed on a DC
15 Will save or be *charmed* for 24 hours. Most *charmed* creatures are
used to perform heavy labor, guard duty, and other onerous tasks for the
nixie community. Shortly before the effect wears off, the nixie escorts
the *charmed* creature away and orders it to keep walking. The save DC
is Charisma-based.

### Amphibious (Ex)
Although nixies are aquatic, they can survive
indefinitely on land.

### *Water Breathing* (Sp)
Once per day a nixie can use *water
breathing* as the spell (caster level 12th). Nixies usually bestow this
effect on those they have *charmed.*

### Wild Empathy (Ex)
This ability works like the druid's wild empathy
class feature, except that a nixie has a +6 racial bonus on the check.

### Skills
A nixie has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. \*Nixies
have a +5 racial bonus on Hide checks when in the water.

  Challenge Rating:      1/2
  Treasure:              None
  Alignment:             Always neutral
  Advancement:           ---
  Level Adjustment:      ---
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------

A stirge's coloration ranges from rust-red to reddish-brown, with a
dirty yellow underside. The proboscis is pink at the tip, fading to gray
at its base.

A stirge's body is about 1 foot long, with a wingspan of about 2 feet.
It weighs about 1 pound.

### Combat

A stirge attacks by landing on a victim, finding a vulnerable spot, and
plunging its proboscis into the flesh. This is a touch attack and can
target only Small or larger creatures.

### Attach (Ex)
If a stirge hits with a touch attack, it uses its eight
pincers to latch onto the opponent's body. An attached stirge is
effectively grappling its prey. The stirge loses its Dexterity bonus to
AC and has an AC of 12, but holds on with great tenacity. Stirges have a
+12 racial bonus on grapple checks (already figured into the Base
Attack/Grapple entry above).

An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To
remove an attached stirge through grappling, the opponent must achieve a
pin against the stirge.

### Blood Drain (Ex)
A stirge drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
Constitution damage in any round when it begins its turn attached to a
victim. Once it has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches
and flies off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the stirge's
appetite has been sated, the stirge detaches and seeks a new target.

## Swarm

Swarms are dense masses of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that
would not be particularly dangerous in small groups, but can be terrible
foes when gathered in sufficient numbers. For game purposes a swarm is
defined as a single creature with a space of 10 feet---gigantic hordes
are actually composed of dozens of swarms in close proximity. A swarm
has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative
modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. It makes saving
throws as a single creature.

Many different creatures can mass as swarms; bat swarms, centipede
swarms, hellwasp swarms, locust swarms, rat swarms, and spider swarms
are described here. The swarm's type varies with the nature of the
component creature (most are animals or vermin), but all swarms have the
swarm subtype.

A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000
flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500
nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures
consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of
nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit
in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a
swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other
and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented
by multiples of single swarms. A large swarm is completely shapeable,
though it usually remains contiguous.

### Combat

In order to attack, a single swarm moves into opponents' spaces, which
provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a
creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey, but remains a
creature with a 10-foot space. Swarms never make attacks of opportunity,
but they can provoke attacks of opportunity.

Unlike other creatures with a 10-foot space, a swarm is shapeable. It
can occupy any four contiguous squares, and it can squeeze through any
space large enough to contain one of its component creatures.

#### Vulnerabilities of Swarms

Swarms are extremely difficult to fight with physical attacks. However,
they have a few special vulnerabilities, as follows:

A lit torch swung as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of fire
damage per hit.

A weapon with a special ability such as flaming or frost deals its full
energy damage with each hit, even if the weapon's normal damage can't
affect the swarm.

A lit lantern can be used as a thrown weapon, dealing 1d4 points of fire
damage to all creatures in squares adjacent to where it breaks.

A bat swarm is nocturnal, and is never found aboveground in daylight.

#### Combat

A bat swarm seeks to surround and attack any warm-blooded prey it
encounters. The swarm deals 1d6 points of damage to any creature whose
space it occupies at the end of its move.

healing magic.

### Blindsense (Ex)
A bat swarm notices and locates creatures within 20
feet. Opponents still have total concealment against the bat swarm (but
swarm attacks ignore concealment).

A single hellwasp resembles a thumb-sized normal wasp, except its
carapace is gleaming black with ruby-red stripes, and its compound eyes
are an iridescent green. In swarms, hellwasps form a collective hive
mind intelligence with infernal cunning and bloodlust.

#### Combat

Like any swarm, a hellwasp swarm seeks to surround and attack any living
prey it encounters. A swarm deals 3d6 points of damage to any creature
whose space it occupies at the end of its move. The swarm can take over
the bodies of its prey and infest both the living and the dead, using
them as horrible living (or unliving) puppets to accomplish acts of
wickedness that a swarm of insects could never attempt.

A hellwasp swarm's attack is treated as an evil-aligned weapon and a
magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Distraction (Ex)
Any living creature that begins its turn with a
hellwasp swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be
nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Inhabit (Ex)
A hellwasp swarm can enter the body of a helpless or
dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting
requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large
(although four swarms working together can inhabit a Huge creature). The
swarm can abandon the body at any time, although doing this takes 1 full
round. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp
swarm as well, although the swarm's resistances and immunities may
negate some or all of this damage.

If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it can restore animation to
the creature and control its movements, effectively transforming it into
a zombie of the appropriate size for as long as the swarm remains
inside. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize
the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and
actions as if using *dominate monster* on the victim. The hellwasps
quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution
damage per hour they inhabit a body. A body reduced to Constitution 0 is
dead.

A hellwasp-inhabited creature is relatively easy to spot, since its skin
crawls with the forms of insects inside. The swarm is intelligent enough
to attempt to hide beneath loose clothing or a large cloak to keep its
presence from being detected. The swarm can attempt a Disguise check to
conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a --4 penalty if currently
inhabiting a Small host.

A *remove disease* or *heal* spell cast on an inhabited victim forces
the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial and secondary damage
1d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Hive Mind (Ex)
Any hellwasp swarm with at least 1 hit point per Hit
Die (or 12 hit points, for a standard hellwasp swarm) forms a hive mind,
giving it an Intelligence of 6. When a hellwasp swarm is reduced below
this hit point threshold, it becomes mindless.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tarrasque is 70 feet long and 50 feet tall, and it weighs about 130
tons.

The tarrasque cannot speak.

### Combat

The tarrasque attacks with its claws, teeth, horns, and tail.

The tarrasque's natural weapons are treated as epic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Augmented Critical (Ex)
The tarrasque's bite threatens a critical
hit on a natural attack roll of 18--20, dealing triple damage on a
successful critical hit.

### Frightful Presence (Su)
The tarrasque can inspire terror by
charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 36 Will
save or become shaken, remaining in that condition as long as they
remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, the tarrasque must hit a
Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can
try to swallow the foe the following round.

### Rush (Ex)
Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can
move at a speed of 150 feet.

### Swallow Whole (Ex)
The tarrasque can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check.
Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus
2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the tarrasque's digestive
juices. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 50 points of
damage to the tarrasque's digestive tract (AC 25). Once the creature
exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must
cut its own way out. The tarrasque's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32
Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures.

### Carapace (Ex)
The tarrasque's armorlike carapace is exceptionally
tough and highly reflective, deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even
*magic missile*spells. There is a 30% chance of reflecting any such
effect back at the caster; otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for
reflection before rolling to overcome the creature's spell resistance.

### Regeneration (Ex)
No form of attack deals lethal damage to the
tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if it fails a saving throw
against a *disintegrate* spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque fails
its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as
those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal
damage equal to the creature's full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hp).
The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding
wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or
a clay golem's cursed wound ability.

The tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to
its full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hit points) and using a *wish* or
*miracle* spell to keep it dead.

If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in
1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). The creature
can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.

### Skills
The tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

## Tendriculos

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

  Feats:                 Alertness, Iron Will, Power Attack, Stealthy
  Environment:           Temperate forests
  Organization:          Solitary
  Challenge Rating:      6
  Treasure:              1/10th coins; 50% goods; 50% items
  Alignment:             Always neutral
  Advancement:           10--16 HD (Huge); 17--27 HD (Gargantuan)
  Level Adjustment:      ---
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

A tendriculos can rear up to a height of 15 feet. It weighs about 3,500
pounds.

Animals and other plant creatures are unnerved by the presence of a
tendriculos; they avoid it and any place it has been within the last 24
hours.

### Combat

Prowling deep forests or waiting in vegetated areas (looking like
nothing more than a small hillock), a tendriculos attacks savagely,
showing no fear. It attempts to swallow as much flesh as it can, as
quickly as it can.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a tendriculos must hit a
creature at least one size smaller than itself with its bite attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking
an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round. A
tendriculos can also use its improved grab ability on a tendril attack.
If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, picks up the
opponent, and transfers it to the mouth as a free action, automatically
dealing bite damage.

### Swallow Whole/Paralysis (Ex)
A tendriculos can try to swallow a
grabbed opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside the
plant's mass, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be
paralyzed for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos's digestive juices, taking
2d6 points of acid damage per round. A new save is required each round
inside the plant. The save DC is Constitution-based. A swallowed
creature that avoids paralysis can climb out of the mass with a
successful grapple check. This returns it to the plant's maw, where
another successful grapple check is needed to get free. A swallowed
creature can also cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing
weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the tendriculos's interior (AC
14). Once the creature exits, the plant's regenerative capacity closes
the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge
tendriculos's interior can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny,
or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents.

### Regeneration (Ex)
Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal normal damage
to a tendriculos. A tendriculos that loses part of its body mass can
regrow it in 1d6 minutes. Holding the severed portion against the mass
enables it to reattach instantly.

## Thoqqua

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Medium Elemental (Earth, Extraplanar, Fire)
  Hit Dice:              3d8+3 (16 hp)

  Organization:          Solitary or pair
  Challenge Rating:      2
  Treasure:              None

  Advancement:           4--9 HD (Large)
  Level Adjustment:      ---
  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A thoqqua is about 1 foot in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long. It weighs
about 200 pounds.

### Combat

When a thoqqua is disturbed, its first instinct is to attack. Its
favored tactic is to spring directly at a foe, either by bursting out of
the rock or by coiling up its body and launching itself like a spring.
(Treat this as a charge, even though the thoqqua does not need to move
10 feet before attacking.)

### Heat (Ex)
Merely touching or being touched by a thoqqua
automatically deals 2d6 fire damage.

### Burn (Ex)
When a thoqqua hits with its slam attack, the opponent
must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save or catch fire. The save DC is
Constitution-based. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds if not extinguished
sooner. A burning creature can use a full-round action to put out the
flame.

A titan is about 25 feet tall and weighs about 14,000 pounds.

Titans speak Abyssal, Common, Celestial, Draconic, and Giant.

### Combat

A titan's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Oversized Weapon (Ex)
A titan wields a great, two-handed warhammer
(big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without penalty.

### Spell-Like Abilities
At will---*chain lightning* (DC 23), *charm
monster* (DC 21), *cure critical wounds* (DC 21), *fire storm* (DC 24),
*greater dispel magic, hold monster* (DC 22), *invisibility,
invisibility purge, levitate, persistent image* (DC 22), *polymorph*
(humanoid forms only, duration 1 hour); 3/day---*etherealness, word of
chaos* (DC 22), *summon nature's ally IX*; 1/day---*gate, maze, meteor
swarm* (DC 26). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

In addition, titans of good or neutral alignment can use the following
additional spell-like abilities: At will---*daylight, holy smite* (DC
21), *remove curse* (DC 21); 1/day---*greater restoration*. Caster level
20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Titans of evil alignment can use the following additional spell-like
abilities: At will---*bestow curse* (DC 21), *deeper darkness, unholy
blight* (DC 21); 1/day---*crushing hand* (DC 26). Caster level 20th. The
save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Tactics Round-by-Round

Titans enjoy combat and usually close with their foes. If that proves
ineffective, they swiftly back off and pelt the foe with spell-like
abilities and magical effects. Because of a titan's Quicken Spell-Like
Ability feat, it can use *chain lightning* as a free action, and
frequently attacks in melee while lashing out with this ability at the
same time.

*Prior to combat: Invisibility purge* or *invisibility*.

*Round 1:* Charge and attempt to sunder the weapon of the most dangerous
foe. Hurl *chain lightning* at opponents standing away from the fight.

*Round 2:* Full attack against the disarmed opponent, and hurl *chain
lightning* at other opponents.

*Round 3:* Back away from first opponent and use *maze* or *meteor
swarm* on any spellcaster causing trouble.

*Round 4:* Sunder the weapon of the next most effective combatant, or
use *greater dispel magic* on all nearby opponents.

*Round 5:* Full attack against any nearby opponent, or use *fire storm*.

Use another quickened *chain lightning* if foes seem really dangerous.

A titan usually reserves its *gate* and *etherealness* abilities to

A tojanida's shell is blue-green in color. Inside the shell is a fleshy
body from which extend seven stalks. Four of these stalks have paddles
for locomotion, two are tipped with claws, and one bears the creature's
head. Eight vents in the shell, four at each end, allow the tojanida to
thrust its stalks out in whatever configuration it finds convenient.

A juvenile tojanida is up to 25 years old. It has a shell about 3 feet
long, and it weighs about 60 pounds. An adult is aged 26 to 80. Its
shell is about 6 feet long, and it weighs about 220 pounds. An elder can
reach 150 years of age. It has a shell about 9 feet long, and it weighs
about 500 pounds.

Tojanidas speak Aquan and can be loquacious, but usually only on the
subject of food.

### Combat

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a tojanida must hit with a
bite or claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Underwater, a
tojanida can tow a grabbed victim of its own size or smaller at its swim
speed (but it cannot run). A favorite tactic is to grab a single
opponent, then withdraw, hauling the opponent away from its allies.

### Ink Cloud (Ex)
A tojanida can emit a spherical cloud of jet-black
ink with a radius of 30 feet once per minute as a free action. The
effect is otherwise similar to *fog cloud* cast by an individual of a
level equal to the tojanida's Hit Dice. Out of water, the ink emerges in
a stream up to 30 feet long, which a tojanida can squirt into an
opponent's eyes. The affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save or
be blinded for 1 round. The save DC is 13 against a juvenile, 15 against
an adult, and 21 against an elder. The save DCs are Constitution based.

### All-Around Vision (Ex)
The multiple apertures in a tojanida's shell
allow it to look in any direction, bestowing a +4 racial bonus on Spot
and Search checks. Opponents gain no flanking bonuses when attacking a
tojanida.

### Skills
A tojanida has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A treant's leaves are deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall
and winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they rarely
fall out. A treant's legs fit together when closed to look like the
trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable
from a tree.

A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a "trunk" about 2 feet in diameter.
It weighs about 4,500 pounds.

Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Sylvan. Most also can
manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid tongues---at least
enough to say "Get away from my trees!"

### Combat

Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They
often charge suddenly from cover to trample the despoilers of forests.
If sorely pressed, they animate trees as reinforcements.

### *Animate Trees* (Sp)
A treant can animate trees within 180 feet at
will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a
normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 feet
and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their
ability to move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or
moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to *liveoak*
(caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire
that a treant has.

### Double Damage against Objects (Ex)
A treant or animated tree that
makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.

### Trample (Ex)
Reflex DC 22 half. The save DC is Strength-based.
Skills: \*Treants have a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks made in
forested areas.

A triton has silvery skin that fades into silver-blue scales on the
lower half of its body. A triton's hair is deep blue or blue-green.

A triton is about the same size and weight as a human. Tritons speak
Common and Aquan.

### Combat

The reclusive tritons prefer to avoid combat, but they fiercely defend
their homes. They attack with either melee or ranged weapons as the
circumstances warrant. When encountered outside their lair, they are 90%
likely to be mounted on friendly sea creatures such as porpoises.

### Spell-Like Abilities
1/day---*summon nature's ally IV.* Caster
level 7th. Tritons often choose water elementals for their companions.

### Skills
A triton has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.

Troglodytes speak Draconic.

### Combat

Half of a group of troglodytes are armed only with claws and teeth; the
rest carry one or two javelins and clubs. They normally conceal
themselves, launch a volley of javelins, then close to attack. If the
battle goes against them, they retreat and attempt to hide.

Stench (Ex): When a troglodyte is angry or frightened, it secretes an
oily, musk-like chemical that nearly every form of animal life finds
offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a
troglodyte must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10
rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully
save cannot be affected by the same troglodyte's stench for 24 hours. A
*delay poison* or *neutralize poison* spell removes the effect from the
sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and
creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving
throws.

Skills: The skin of a troglodyte changes color somewhat, allowing it to
blend in with its surroundings like a chameleon and providing a +4
racial bonus on Hide checks. \*In rocky or underground settings, this
bonus improves to +8.

Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their
gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangle and drag along the
ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.

A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Females
are slightly larger than males. A troll's rubbery hide is moss green,
mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish
black or iron gray.

Trolls speak Giant.

### Combat

Trolls have no fear of death: They launch themselves into combat without
hesitation, flailing wildly at the closest opponent. Even when
confronted with fire, they try to get around the flames and attack.

### Rend (Ex)
If a troll hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto
the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals
an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.

### Regeneration (Ex)
Fire and acid deal normal damage to a troll. If a
troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6
minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by
holding it to the stump.

### Scrag

These cousins of the troll have the aquatic subtype. They dwell in any
body of water in any climate. They have a base land speed of 20 feet and
a swim speed of 40 feet and are found only in aquatic environments. They
regenerate only if mostly immersed in water.

### Troll Hunter

Some trolls, more cunning than most, are not satisfied with merely
eating civilized beings but train to hunt them relentlessly. These troll
hunters are fearsome rangers who focus on slaying and devouring humanoid
prey.

#### Combat

A troll hunter makes full use of its scent ability to track its favored
enemies and generally prefers to hunt in darkness.

The troll hunter uses its limited repertoire of spells to protect itself
from damaging forms of energy and to immobilize enemies.

*Typical Ranger Spells Prepared* (2; save DC 12 + spell level):
1st---*entangle, resist energy.*

A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males
sport a white beard.

A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at
the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and
slimmer than males.

Unicorns speak Sylvan and Common.

### Combat

Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their
forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances,
or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its
power fades if removed from the unicorn.

### Magic Circle against Evil (Su)
This ability continuously duplicates
the effect of the spell. A unicorn cannot suppress this ability.

### Spell-Like Abilities
Unicorns can use *detect evil* at will as a
free action.

Once per day a unicorn can use *greater teleport* to move anywhere
within its home. It cannot teleport beyond the forest boundaries nor
back from outside.

A unicorn can use *cure light wounds* three times per day and *cure
moderate wounds* once per day (caster level 5th) by touching a wounded
creature with its horn. Once per day it can use *neutralize poison* (DC
21, caster level 8th) with a touch of its horn. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

### Wild Empathy (Ex)
This power works like the druid's wild empathy
class feature, except that a unicorn has a +6 racial bonus on the check.

### Skills

A celestial charger's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Smite Evil (Su)

## Vampire

Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features are
often hardened and feral, with the predatory look of wolves.

Like liches, they often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the
guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance, vampires can be
easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in
mirrors.

Vampires speak any languages they knew in life.

### Creating a Vampire

"Vampire" is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or
monstrous humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the base
creature).

A vampire uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities
except as noted here.

### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to undead (augmented
humanoid or monstrous humanoid). Do not recalculate base attack bonus,
saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.

### Hit Dice
Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.

### Speed
Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim
speed, the vampire retains the ability to swim and is not vulnerable to
immersion in running water (see below).

### Armor Class
The base creature's natural armor bonus improves by +6.

### Attack
A vampire retains all the attacks of the base creature and
also gains a slam attack if it didn't already have one. If the base
creature can use weapons, the vampire retains this ability. A creature
with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A vampire fighting
without weapons uses either its slam attack or its primary natural
weapon (if it has any). A vampire armed with a weapon uses its slam or a
weapon, as it desires.

### Full Attack
A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its slam
attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with
a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a
slam or other natural weapon as a natural secondary attack.

### Damage
Vampires have slam attacks. If the base creature does not
have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value from the table
below according to the vampire's size. Creatures that have other kinds
of natural weapons retain their old damage values or use the appropriate
value from the table below, whichever is better.

  ------------ --------
  Size         Damage
  Fine         1
  Diminutive   1d2
  Tiny         1d3
  Small        1d4
  Medium       1d6
  Large        1d8
  Huge         2d6
  Gargantuan   2d8
  Colossal     4d6
  ------------ --------

### Special Attacks
A vampire retains all the special attacks of the
base creature and gains those described below. Saves have a DC of 10 +
1/2 vampire's HD + vampire's Cha modifier unless noted otherwise.

***Blood Drain (Ex):***A vampire can suck blood from a living victim
with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe,
it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the
pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the vampire gains 5
temporary hit points.

***Children of the Night (Su):***Vampires command the lesser creatures
of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat
swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base
creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of
similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the
vampire for up to 1 hour.

***Dominate (Su):***A vampire can crush an opponent's will just by
looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except
that the vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at
it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will
save or fall instantly under the vampire's influence as though by a
*dominate person* spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of
30 feet.

***Create Spawn (Su):***A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a
vampire's energy drain rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire Spawn
entry) 1d4 days after burial.

If the vampire instead drains the victim's Constitution to 0 or lower,
the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a vampire if
it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under
the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until
its master's destruction. At any given time a vampire may have enslaved
spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates
that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or
vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn
of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires
in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in
order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn
cannot be enslaved again.

***Energy Drain (Su):***Living creatures hit by a vampire's slam attack
(or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two
negative levels. For each negative level bestowed, the vampire gains 5
temporary hit points. A vampire can use its energy drain ability once
per round.

### Special Qualities
A vampire retains all the special qualities of
the base creature and gains those described below.

*Alternate Form (Su):* A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire
bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is similar to
a *polymorph* spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that the
vampire does not regain hit points for changing form and must choose
from among the forms mentioned here. While in its alternate form, the
vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains
the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.
It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next
sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might
allow other forms.)

*Damage Reduction (Su):* A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and
magic. A vampire's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

*Fast Healing (Ex):* A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so
long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in
combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It
must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It
can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to
a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its
coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then
is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points
per round.

*Gaseous Form (Su):* As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous
form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous
indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect
maneuverability.

*Resistances (Ex):* A vampire has resistance to cold 10 and electricity
10.

*Spider Climb (Ex):* A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a
*spider climb* spell.

*Turn Resistance (Ex):* A vampire has +4 turn resistance.

### Abilities
Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +6, Dex
+4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no
Constitution score.

### Skills
Vampires have a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the
base creature.

### Feats
Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved
Initiative, and Lightning Reflexes, assuming the base creature meets the
prerequisites and doesn't already have these feats.

### Environment
Any, usually same as base creature.

### Organization
Solitary, pair, gang (3--5), or troupe (1--2 plus 2--5
vampire spawn)

### Challenge Rating
Same as the base creature +2.

### Treasure
Double standard.

### Alignment
Always evil (any).

### Advancement
By character class.

### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +8.

#### Vampire Weaknesses

For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.

### Repelling a Vampire
Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of
garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil
from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don't
harm the vampire---they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must
stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy
symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature
holding the item for the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay
takes a standard action.

Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be
carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship.

They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited
in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public
places, since these are by definition open to all.

### Slaying a Vampire
Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower
incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see the note on fast
healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any
vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can take only a single move
action or attack action and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it
cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it
of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the
end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a
vampire's heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life
if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A popular tactic
is to cut off the creature's head and fill its mouth with holy wafers
(or their equivalent).

#### Vampire Characters

Vampires are always evil, which causes characters of certain classes to
lose some class abilities. In addition, certain classes take additional
penalties.

### Clerics
Vampire clerics lose their ability to turn undead but gain
the ability to rebuke undead. This ability does not affect the vampire's
controller or any other vampires that a master controls. A vampire
cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction,
Evil, or Trickery.

### Sorcerers and Wizards
Vampire sorcerers and wizards retain their
class abilities, but if a character has a familiar other than a rat or
bat, the link between them is broken, and the familiar shuns its former
companion. The character can summon another familiar, but it must be a
rat or bat.

Vampire spawn are undead creatures that come into being when vampires
slay mortals. Like their creators, spawn remain bound to their coffins
and to the soil of their graves. Vampire spawn appear much as they did
in life, although their features are often hardened, with a predatory
look.

Vampire spawn speak Common.

### Combat

Vampire spawn use their inhuman strength when engaging mortals,
hammering their foes with powerful blows and dashing them against rocks
or walls. They also use their gaseous form and flight abilities to
strike where opponents are most vulnerable.

### Blood Drain (Ex)
A vampire spawn can suck blood from a living
victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins
the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each
round. On each such successful drain attack, the vampire spawn gains 5
temporary hit pints.

### Domination (Su)
A vampire spawn can crush an opponent's will just
by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack,
except that the vampire must take a standard action, and those merely
looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed
on a DC 14 Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's influence as
though by a *dominate person* spell from a 5thlevel caster. The ability
has a range of 30 feet. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Energy Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a vampire spawn's slam
attack gain one negative level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to
remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such
negative level bestowed, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit points.

### Fast Healing (Ex)
A vampire spawn heals 2 points of damage each
round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points
in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape.
It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed.
(It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its coffin,
it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer
helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.

### Gaseous Form (Su)
As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume
*gaseous form* at will as the spell (caster level 6th), but it can
remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect
maneuverability.

### Spider Climb (Ex)
A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as
though with a *spider climb* spell.

### Skills
Vampire spawn have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen,
Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.

### Vampire Spawn Weaknesses

Vampire spawn are vulnerable to all attacks and effects that repel or
slay vampires. For details, see the Vampire entry.

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------

A vargouille is slightly larger than a human head, about 18 inches high,
with a wingspan of 4 feet. It weighs about 10 pounds.

Vargouilles speak Infernal.

### Combat

Vargouilles attack by biting with their jagged teeth. Their special
attacks make them even more dangerous. A vargouille's natural weapons,
as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Shriek (Su)
Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended
mouth and let out a terrible shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other
vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the creature must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed with fear for 2d4
rounds or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves
their sight. A paralyzed creature is susceptible to the vargouille's
kiss (see below). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
again by the same vargouille's shriek for 24 hours. The shriek is a
mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and
includes a +1 racial bonus.

### Kiss (Su)
A vargouille can kiss a paralyzed target with a
successful melee touch attack. An affected opponent must succeed on a DC
15 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that turns the
creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll
1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation).

First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim's hair falls out.
Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings,
tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long,
pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence
drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3).
The transformation is complete 1d6 hours later, when the head breaks
free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This
transformation is interrupted by sunlight, and even a *daylight* spell
can delay death, but to reverse the transformation requires *remove
disease*. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial
bonus.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 12 or be unable to heal the
vargouille's bite damage naturally or magically. A *neutralize poison*
or *heal* spell removes the effect, while *delay poison* allows magical
healing. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial
bonus.

A wight's appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the form it
had in life. A wight is about the height and weight of a human.

Wights speak Common.

### Combat

Wights attack by hammering with their fists.

### Create Spawn (Su)
Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight in
1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them
and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the
abilities they had in life.

### Energy Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a wight's slam attack
gain one negative level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to remove a
negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such negative
level bestowed, the wight gains 5 temporary hit points.

### Skills
Wights have a +8 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

Will-o'-wisps can be yellow, white, green, or blue. They are easily
mistaken for lanterns, especially in the foggy marshes and swamps where
they reside. A will-o'-wisp's body is a globe of spongy material about 1
foot across and weighing about 3 pounds, and its glowing body sheds as
much light as a torch.

Will-o'-wisps speak Common and Auran. They have no vocal apparatus but
can vibrate to create a voice with a ghostly sound.

### Combat

Will-o'-wisps usually avoid combat. They prefer to confuse and bewilder
adventurers, luring them into morasses or other hazardous places. When
they are forced to fight, they loose small electrical shocks, which act
as melee touch attacks.

### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A will-o'-wisp is immune to most spells or
spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except *magic missile*
and *maze.*

### Natural Invisibility (Ex)
A startled or frightened will-o'-wisp can
extinguish its glow, effectively becoming invisible as the spell.

A winter wolf grows about 8 feet long and stands about 4-1/2 feet at the
shoulder. It weighs about 450 pounds.

Winter wolves can speak Giant and Common.

### Combat

Winter wolves typically hunt in packs. Their size, cunning, and
formidable breath weapon allow them to hunt and kill creatures much
larger than themselves. A pack usually circles an opponent, each wolf
attacking in turn to exhaust it. If they're in a hurry, white wolves try
to pin their foes.

### Breath Weapon (Su)
15-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 4d6
cold, Reflex DC 16 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Freezing Bite (Su)
A winter wolf deals an extra 1d6 points of cold
damage every time it bites an opponent, as if its bite were a frost
weapon.

### Trip (Ex)
A winter wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to
trip the opponent (+8 check modifier) as a free action without making a
touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt
fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the winter wolf.

### Skills
Winter wolves have a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Move
Silently, and Spot checks. Winter wolves have a +2 racial bonus on Hide
checks. \*Their natural coloration grants them a +7 racial bonus on Hide
checks in areas of snow and ice. A winter wolf has a +4 racial bonus on
Survival checks when tracking by scent.

A typical worg has gray or black fur, grows to 5 feet long and stands 3
feet tall at the shoulder. It weighs 300 pounds.

More intelligent than their smaller cousins, worgs speak their own
language. Some can also speak Common and Goblin.

### Combat

Mated pairs or packs work together to bring down large game, while lone
worgs usually chase down creatures smaller than themselves. Both often
use hit-and-run tactics to exhaust their quarry. A pack usually circles
a larger opponent: Each wolf attacks in turn, biting and retreating,
until the creature is exhausted, at which point the pack moves in for
the kill. If they get impatient or heavily outnumber the opponent, worgs
attempt to pin it.

### Trip (Ex)
A worg that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip
the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch
attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the
opponent cannot react to trip the worg.

### Skills
A worg has a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, and
Spot checks, and a +2 racial bonus on Hide checks. \*A worg has a +4
racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. In some
cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear armored or outfitted
with weapons. This appearance does not affect the creature's AC or
combat abilities but only reflects the shape it had in life.

A wraith is about as tall as a human, while a dread wraith is roughly
the size of an ogre. Since both are incorporeal, they are weightless.

Wraiths speak Common and Infernal.

### Combat

Both the wraith and the dread wraith share the following abilities.

### Unnatural Aura (Su)
Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can
sense the unnatural presence of a wraith at a distance of 30 feet. They
will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do
so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.

### Daylight Powerlessness (Ex)
Wraiths are utterly powerless in
natural sunlight (not merely a *daylight* spell) and flee from it.

### Wraith

### Constitution Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a wraith's
incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or take
1d6 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On each
such successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points.

### Create Spawn (Su)
Any humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a wraith
in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact and inanimate, but its spirit is
torn free from its corpse and transformed. Spawn are under the command
of the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death.
They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

### Dread Wraith

The oldest and most malevolent wraiths lurk in the depths of forgotten
temples and other forsaken places. They can sense the approach of living
creatures, and hunger for them. Despite its size, the dread wraith
possesses unearthly quickness, and makes use of its Spring Attack feat
and natural reach to strike with deadly effect and melt back into the
shadows---or the walls.

### Lifesense (Su)
A dread wraith notices and locates living creatures
within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also
senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast
*deathwatch.*

### Constitution Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a dread wraith's
incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take
1d8 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On each
such successful attack, the dread wraith gains 5 temporary hit points.

### Create Spawn (Su)
Any humanoid slain by a dread wraith becomes a
wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact and inanimate, but its
spirit is torn free from its corpse and transformed. Spawn are under the
command of the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its
death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard
with a poisonous stinger in its tail.

A wyvern's body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that
length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one
ton.

Wyverns speak Draconic, but usually don't bother with anything more
elaborate than a loud hiss or a deep-throated growl much like that of a
bull alligator.

### Combat

Wyverns are rather stupid but always aggressive: They attack nearly
anything that isn't obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern
dives from the air, snatching the opponent with its talons and stinging
it to death. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby
attack.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a wyvern must hit with its
talons. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and stings.

### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage
2d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

### Skills
Wyverns have a +3 racial bonus on Spot checks.

  ---------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A xill stands 4 to 5 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. Xills speak
Infernal.

### Combat

Xills are dangerous opponents, attacking with all four limbs. More
civilized ones use weapons, usually fighting with two at a time so as to
leave two claws free for grab attacks. Xills typically lie in wait on
the Ethereal Plane for suitable prey to happen by, then ambush it using
their planewalk ability. They make full use of their Tumble skill in
combat: Usually, one or two distract physically powerful enemies by
attacking, then assuming a defensive stance while their fellows maneuver
to advantage.

### Implant (Ex)
As a standard action, a xill can lay eggs inside a
paralyzed creature. The young emerge about 90 days later, literally
devouring the host from inside. A *remove disease* spell rids a victim
of the egg, as does a DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer
can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of
damage to the patient.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a xill must hit with one or
more claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. It receives a +2
bonus on the grapple check for each claw that hits. If it wins the
grapple check and maintains the hold in the next round, it automatically
bites the foe at that time. The bite deals no damage but injects a
paralyzing venom.

### Paralysis (Ex)
Those bitten by a xill must succeed on a DC 14
Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 hours. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

### Planewalk (Su)
These planar travelers like to slip between the
folds of space to attack enemies as though from thin air. They can cross
from the Ethereal Plane with a move action but take 2 rounds to cross
back, during which time they are immobile. As a xill fades away, it
becomes harder to hit: Opponents have a 20% miss chance in

the first round and a 50% miss chance in the second. A xill can
planewalk with a willing or helpless creature.

Minor xorns are about 3 feet tall and wide and weigh about 120 pounds.
Average xorns are about 5 feet tall and wide, weighing about 600 pounds.
Elder xorns are about 8 feet tall and wide and weigh about 9,000 pounds.

Xorns speak Common and Terran.

### Combat

Xorns do not attack fleshly beings except to defend themselves or their
property, since they cannot digest meat. Xorns are indifferent to
creatures of the Material Plane---with the sole exception of anyone
carrying a significant amount of precious metals or minerals, which
xorns eat. They can smell food up to 20 feet away. A xorn can be quite
aggressive when seeking food, especially on the Material Plane, where
such sustenance is harder to find than it is on its native plane.

A xorn's favorite mode of attack is to wait just beneath a stone surface
until a foe comes within reach, then emerge suddenly. Groups of xorns
often send one of their number to the surface to negotiate for food
while the remainder position themselves for a surprise attack.

### All-Around Vision (Ex)
A xorn's symmetrically placed eyes allow it
to look in any direction, providing a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search
checks. A xorn can't be flanked.

### Earth Glide (Ex)
A xorn can glide through stone, dirt, or almost
any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through
water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create
any ripple or other signs of its presence. A *move earth* spell cast on
an area containing a burrowing xorn flings the xorn back 30 feet,
stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15
Fortitude save.

A yeth hound stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 400
pounds.

Yeth hounds cannot speak, but understand Infernal.

### Combat

Yeth hounds hunt only at night. They fear the sun and never venture out
in daylight, even if their lives depend on it.

A yeth hound's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Bay (Su)
When a yeth hound howls or barks, all creatures except
other evil outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 11
Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic
mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an
affected creature is immune to the same hound's bay for 24 hours. The
save DC is Charisma-based.

### Trip (Ex)
A yeth hound that hits with its bite attack can attempt

A yrthak is blind. It senses sound and movement by means of a special
organ on its long tongue. It emits powerfully focused beams of sound
from the protrusion on its head. The creature is a yellowish-green
color, with the wings and fin being more yellow and the head and body
more green. The teeth are yellow.

A yrthak is about 20 feet long, with a wingspan of 40 feet. It weighs
about 5,000 pounds.

Despite their intelligence, yrthaks do not speak.

### Combat

A yrthak prefers to attack from the air, strafing the ground with sonic
attacks or snatching up and dropping prey.

### Sonic Lance (Su)
Once every 2 rounds, a yrthak can focus sonic
energy in a ray up to 60 feet long. This is a ranged touch attack that
deals 6d6 points of damage to a single target.

### Explosion (Su)
A yrthak can fire its sonic lance at the ground, a
large rock, a stone wall, or the like to create an explosion of
shattered stone. This attack deals 2d6 points of piercing damage to all
within 10 feet of the effect's center. This counts as a use of the sonic
lance attack and thus is usable only once every 2 rounds, and never on
the round following a sonic lance attack.

### Blindsight (Ex)
A yrthak can ascertain all foes within 120 feet.
Beyond that range it is considered blinded. Yrthaks are invulnerable to
gaze attacks, visual effects of spells such as illusions, and other
attack forms that rely on sight. A yrthak whose sense of hearing is
impaired is effectively blinded, treating all targets as having total
concealment.

### Immunities
Yrthaks have immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects,
illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.

### Skills
Yrthaks have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.

## Zombie

Zombies are corpses reanimated through dark and sinister magic.

Because of their utter lack of intelligence, the instructions given to a
newly created zombie must be very simple.

### Creating a Zombie

"Zombie" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal
creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to
hereafter as the base creature).

### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any
subtypes except alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. It
does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's
statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

### Hit Dice
Drop any Hit Dice from class levels (to a minimum of 1),
double the number of Hit Dice left, and raise them to d12s. If the base
creature has more than 10 Hit Dice (not counting those gained with
experience), it can't be made into a zombie with the *animate dead*
spell.

### Speed
If the base creature can fly, its maneuverability rating
drops to clumsy.

### Armor Class
Natural armor bonus increases by a number based on the
zombie's size:

  ----------------- -----
  Tiny or smaller   +0
  Small             +1
  Medium            +2
  Large             +3
  Huge              +4
  Gargantuan        +7
  Colossal          +11
  ----------------- -----

### Base Attack
A zombie has a base attack bonus equal to 1/2 its Hit
Dice.

### Attacks
A zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured
weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A zombie
also gains a slam attack.

### Damage
Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A
slam attack deals damage depending on the zombie's size. (Use the base
creature's slam damage if it's better.)

  ------------ -----
  Fine         1
  Diminutive   1d2
  Tiny         1d3
  Small        1d4
  Medium       1d6
  Large        1d8
  Huge         2d6
  Gargantuan   2d8
  Colossal     4d6
  ------------ -----

### Special Attacks
A zombie retains none of the base creature's
special attacks.

### Special Qualities
A zombie loses most special qualities of the base
creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve
its melee or ranged attacks. A zombie gains the following special
quality.

*Single Actions Only (Ex):* Zombies have poor reflexes and can perform
only a single move action or attack action each round. A zombie can move
up to its speed and attack in the same round, but only if it attempts a
charge.

### Saves
Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will
+1/2 HD + 2.

### Abilities
A zombie's Strength increases by +2, its Dexterity
decreases by 2, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom
changes to 10, and its Charisma changes to 1.

### Skills
A zombie has no skills.

### Feats
A zombie loses all feats of the base creature and gains
Toughness.

### Environment
Any land and underground.

### Organization
Any.

### Challenge Rating
Depends on Hit Dice, as follows:

  ---------- ------------------
  Hit Dice   Challenge Rating
  1/2        1/8
  1          1/4
  2          1/2
  4          1
  6          2
  8--10      3
  12--14     4
  15--16     5
  18--20     6
  ---------- ------------------

### Treasure
None.

### Alignment
Always neutral evil.

Advancement: As base creature, but double Hit Dice (maximum 20), or ---
if the base creature advances by character class.

### Level Adjustment
---.
