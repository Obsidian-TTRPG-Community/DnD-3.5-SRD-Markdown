# IMPROVING MONSTERS

Each of the monster entries describes a typical creature of its kind.
However, there are several methods by which extraordinary or unique
monsters can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by
adding character classes, increasing a monster's Hit Dice, or by adding
a template to a monster. These methods are not mutually exclusive---it's
possible for a monster with a template to be improved by both increasing
its Hit Dice and adding character class levels.

### Class Levels
Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in
shape most commonly advance by adding class levels. Creatures that fall
into this category have an entry of "By character class" in their
Advancement line. When a monster adds a class level, that level usually
represents an increase in experience and learned skills and
capabilities.

### Increased Hit Dice
Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in
shape, and nonintelligent monsters, can advance by increasing their Hit
Dice. Creatures with increased Hit Dice are usually superior specimens
of their race, bigger and more powerful than their run-of-the-mill
fellows.

### Templates
Both intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an
unusual heritage or an inflicted change in their essential nature may be
modified with a template. Templates usually result in tougher monsters
with capabilities that differ from those of their common kin.

Each of these three methods for improving monsters is discussed in more
detail below.

## Ability Score Arrays

Monsters are assumed to have completely average (or standard) ability
scores---a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as modified by their racial
bonuses. However, improved monsters are individuals and often have
better than normal ability scores, and usually make use of either the
elite array or the nonelite array of ability scores. Monsters who
improve by adding a template, and monsters who improve by increasing
their Hit Dice, may use any of the three arrays (standard, nonelite, or
elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be
considered elite.

### Elite Array
The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. While the
monster has one weakness compared to a typical member of its race, it is
significantly better overall. The elite array is most appropriate for
monsters who add levels in a player character class.

### Nonelite Array
The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. The
nonelite array does not necessarily make a monster better than normal,
but it does customize the monster as an individual with strengths and
weaknesses compared to a typical member of its race. The nonelite array
is most appropriate for monsters who add class levels in a NPC class.

### Ability Score Improvement
Treat monster Hit Dice the same as
character level for determining ability score increases. This only
applies to Hit Dice increases, monsters do not gain ability score
increases for levels they "already reached" with their racial Hit Dice,
since these adjustments are included in their basic ability scores.

## Monsters and Class Levels

If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules for
multiclass characters.

The creature's Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it has plus its
racial Hit Dice. A creature's "monster class" is always a favored class,
and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it. Additional Hit
Dice gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a
creature's size.

### Humanoids and Class Levels
Creatures with 1 or less HD replace
their monster levels with their character levels. The monster loses the
attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted by its 1
monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills, feats, and
other class abilities of a 1st-level character of the appropriate class.

### Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level
To determine the
effective character level (ECL) of a monster character, add its level
adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels. The
monster is considered to have experience points equal to the minimum
needed to be a character of its ECL.

If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its character
level for purposes of determining how much equipment it can purchase.
Generally, only monsters with an Advancement entry of "By character
class" receive NPC gear; other creatures adding character levels should
be treated as monsters of the appropriate CR and assigned treasure, not
equipment.

### Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases
A monster's total Hit
Dice, not its ECL, govern its acquisition of feats and ability score
increases.

## Increasing Hit Dice

As its Hit Dice increase, a creature's attack bonuses and saving throw
modifiers might improve. It gains more feats and skills, depending on
its type, as shown on Table: Creature Improvement by Type.

Note that if a creature acquires a character class, it improves
according to its class, not its type.

### Size Increases

A creature may become larger when its Hit Dice are increased (the new
size is noted parenthetically in the monster's Advancement entry).

A size increase affects any special ability the creature has that is
affected by size. Increased size also affects a creature's ability
scores, AC, attack bonuses, and damage values as indicated on the tables
below.

## Templates

Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing
creature. A templated creature can represent a freak of nature, the
individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of
offspring from parents of different species.

### Acquired and Inherited Templates

Some templates can be added to creatures anytime. Templates such as
these are referred to as acquired templates, indicating that the
creature did not always have the attributes of the template.

Other templates, known as inherited templates, are part of a creature
from the beginning of its existence. Creatures are born with these
templates.

It's possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type.

### Reading a Template

A template's description provides a set of instructions for altering an
existing creature, known as the base creature. The changes that a
template might cause to each line of a creature 's statistics block are
discussed below. Generally, if a template does not cause a change to a
certain statistic, that entry is missing from the template description.
For clarity, the entry for a statistic or attribute that is not changed
is sometimes given as "Same as the base creature."

### Size and Type
Templates often change a creature's type, and may
change the creature's size.

If a template changes the base creature's type, the creature also
acquires the augmented subtype unless the template description indicates
otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature's
original type. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the new creature
has the traits of the new type but the features of the original type.

If a template changes a creature's size, use Table: Changes to
Statistics by Size to calculate changes to natural armor, Armor Class,
attack rolls, and grapple bonus.

### Hit Dice and Hit Points
Most templates do not change the number of
Hit Dice a monster has, but some do. Some templates change the size of a
creature's Hit Dice (usually by changing the creature type). A few
templates change previously acquired Hit Dice, and continue to change
Hit Dice gained with class levels, but most templates that change Hit
Dice change only the creature's original HD and leave class Hit Dice
unchanged.

If the Hit Dice entry in a template description is missing, Hit Dice and
hit points do not change unless the creature's Constitution modifier
changes.

### Initiative
If a template changes the monster's Dexterity, or if it
adds or removes the Improved Initiative feat, this entry changes.

### Speed
If a template modifies a creature's speed, the template
states how that happens. More commonly, a template adds a new movement
mode.

### Armor Class
If a template changes the creature's size, see Table:
Changes to Statistics by Size to determine its new Armor Class and to
see whether its natural armor changes. In some cases the method of
determining Armor Class changes radically; the template description
explains how to adjust the creature's AC.

### Base Attack/Grapple
Templates usually do not change a creature's
base attack bonus. If a template modifies a creature's base attack
bonus, the template description states how that happens. Changes to a
creature's Strength score can change a creature's grapple bonus, as can
changes to its size.

### Attack and Full Attack
Most templates do not change a creature's
attack bonus or modes of attack, even when the creature's type changes
(the creature's base attack bonus is the same as a creature of the
original type). Of course, any change in ability scores may affect
attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use the new modifier
to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster's size also changes
its attack bonus; see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.

### Damage
Damage changes with Strength. If the creature uses a
two-handed weapon or has a single natural weapon, it adds 1-1/2 times
its Strength bonus to the damage. If it has more than a single attack
then it adds its Strength bonus to damage rolls for the primary attack
and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all secondary attacks.

### Space/Reach
A template may change this entry if it changes the
monster's size. Note that this table does not take into account special
situations such as exceptional reach.

### Special Attacks
A template may add or remove special attacks. The
template description gives the details of any special attacks a template
provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if applicable.

### Special Qualities
A template may add or remove special qualities.
The template description gives the details of any special qualities a
template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if
applicable. Even if the special qualities entry is missing from a
template description, the creature still gains any qualities associated
with its new type.

### Base Saves
As with attacks, changing a monster's type does not
always change its base saving throw bonuses. You only need to adjust
them for new modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom. A
template may, however, state that a monster has a different "good"
saving throw.

### Abilities
If a template changes one or more ability scores, these
changes are noted here.

### Skills
As with attacks, changing a monster's type does not always
change its skill points. Most templates don't change the number of Hit
Dice a creature has, so you don't need to adjust skills in that case
unless the key abilities for those skills have changed, or the template
gives a bonus on one or more skills, or unless the template gives a feat
that provides a bonus on a skill check.

Some templates change how skill points are determined, but this change
usually only affects skill points gained after the template is applied.
Treat skills listed in the base creature's description as class skills,
as well as any new skills provided by the template.

### Feats
Since most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a
creature has, a template will not change the number of feats the
creature has. Some templates grant one or more bonus feats.

### Environment
Usually the same as the base creature.

### Organization
Usually the same as the base creature.

### Challenge Rating
Most templates increase the creature's Challenge
Rating. A template might provide a modifier to be added to the base
creature's CR, or it might specify a range of modifiers depending on the
base creature's original Hit Dice or CR.

### Treasure
Usually the same as the base creature.

### Alignment
Usually the same as the base creature, unless the
template is associated with a certain alignment.

### Advancement
Usually the same as the base creature.

### Level Adjustment
This entry is a modifier to the base creature's
level adjustment. Any level adjustment is meaningless unless the
creature retains a high enough Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain class
levels after applying the template.

#### Adding More Than One Template

In theory, there's no limit to the number of templates you can add to a
creature. To add more than one template, just apply each template one at
a time. Always apply inherited templates before applying acquired
templates. Whenever you add multiple templates, pay attention to the
creature's type---you may add a template that makes the creature
ineligible for other templates you might want to add.

## Advanced Monster Challenge Rating

When adding class levels to a creature with 1 or less HD, you advance
the creature like a character. Otherwise, use the following guidelines.

### Adding Class Levels

If you are advancing a monster by adding player character class levels,
decide if the class levels directly improve the monster's existing
capabilities.

When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it typical
ability scores appropriate for that class. Most creatures are built
using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10,
adjusted by racial modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use the
elite array of ability scores before racial adjustments: 15, 14, 13, 12,
10, 8. Creatures with NPC classes use the nonelite array of 13, 12, 11,
10, 9, 8. T

#### Associated Class Levels

Class levels that increase a monster's existing strengths are known as
associated class levels. Each associated class level a monster has
increases its CR by 1.

Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes for a
creature that relies on its fighting ability.

Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on
stealth to surprise its foes, or on skill use to give itself an
advantage.

A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature that already
has the ability to cast spells as a character of the class in question,
since the monster's levels in the spellcasting class stack with its
innate spellcasting ability.

#### Nonassociated Class Levels

If you add a class level that doesn't directly play to a creature's
strength the class level is considered nonassociated, and things get a
little more complicated. Adding a nonassociated class level to a monster
increases its CR by 1/2 per level until one of its nonassociated class
levels equals its original Hit Dice. At that point, each additional
level of the same class or a similar one is considered associated and
increases the monster's CR by 1.

Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.

### Adding Hit Dice

When you improve a monster by adding Hit Dice, use Table: Improved
Monster CR Increase to determine the effect on the creature's CR. Keep
in mind that many monsters that advance by adding Hit Dice also increase
in size. Do not stack this CR increase with any increase from class
levels. In general, once you've doubled a creature's CR, you should
closely watch any additional increases in its abilities. Adding Hit Dice
to a creature improves several of its abilities, and radical increases
might not follow this progression indefinitely. Compare the monster's
improved attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and any DCs of its special
abilities from the HD increase to typical characters of the appropriate
level and adjust the CR accordingly.

  : Table: Improved Monster CR Increase

### Increasing Size

Generally, increasing a monster's size increases its combat
effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased Strength, reach, and other
benefits. Apply this modifier if you increase a creature beyond Medium
and in conjunction with any other increases.

Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size may
actually lose effectiveness because of a size increase. Monsters that
don't benefit from size increases don't advance in that manner for this
reason.

### Adding Special Abilities

You can add any sort of spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary
ability to a creature. As with a class level, you should determine how
much, or how little, this ability adds to the creature's existing
repertoire. A suite of abilities that work together should be treated as
a single modifier for this purpose. If the ability (or combination of
abilities) significantly increases the monster's combat effectiveness,
increase its CR by 2. Minor abilities increase the creature's CR by 1,
and truly trivial abilities may not increase CR at all. If the special
abilities a monster gains are not tied to a class or Hit Die increase,
this CR increase stacks.

A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance of
incapacitating or crippling a character in one round. A significant
special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster's
vulnerability to common attacks. Do not add this factor twice if a
monster has both special attacks and special qualities.

Make sure to "scale" your evaluation of these abilities by the monster's
current CR.
