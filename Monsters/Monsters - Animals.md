# MONSTERS (ANIMALS)

This section provides statistics and basic information for many common
kinds of mundane animals. These creatures generally operate on instinct,
driven by simple needs such as food and reproduction. Most animals, even
predators, do not attack unless they or their young are threatened.

Animals are not capable of detailed reasoning, although with the Handle
Animal skill it is possible to tame an animal and teach it to perform
certain tricks.

Some herbivorous animals do not normally use their natural weapons to
attack. As such, their natural weapons are treated as secondary attacks.
The animal's attack and damage entries note this fact, with an
explanatory footnote.

### Animal Traits
An animal possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

---Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence score
of 3 or higher can be an animal).

---Low-light vision.

---*Alignment:* Always neutral. Animals are not governed by a human
sense of morality.

---*Treasure:* None. Animals never possess treasure.

Crocodiles are aggressive predators 11 to 12 feet long. They lie mostly
submerged in rivers or marshes, with only their eyes and nostrils
showing, waiting for prey to come within reach.

### Combat

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a crocodile must hit with
its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, the crocodile establishes a hold on the opponent with its mouth
and drags it into deep water, attempting to pin it to the bottom.

### Hold Breath (Ex)
A crocodile can hold its breath for a number of
rounds equal to 4 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

### Skills
A crocodile has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. \*A
crocodile gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in the water.
Further, a crocodile can lie in the water with only its eyes and
nostrils showing, gaining a +10 cover bonus on Hide checks.

adds only half the pony's Strength bonus to damage.

### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a pony is up to 75 pounds; a
medium load, 76--150 pounds; and a heavy load, 151--225 pounds. A pony
can drag 1,125 pounds.

Porpoises are mammals that tend to be playful, friendly, and helpful. A
typical porpoise is 4 to 6 feet long and weighs 110 to 160 pounds. The
statistics presented here can describe any small whale of similar size.

### Combat

### Blindsight (Ex)
Porpoises can "see" by emitting high-frequency
sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate
objects and creatures within 120 feet. A *silence* spell negates this
and forces the porpoise to rely on its vision, which is approximately as
good as a human's.

### Hold Breath (Ex)
A porpoise can hold its breath for a number of
rounds equal to 6 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

### Skills
A porpoise has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. \*A
porpoise has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses
are lost if its blindsight is negated.

These carnivorous fish are aggressive and liable to make unprovoked
attacks against anything that approaches them. Smaller sharks are from 5
to 8 feet long and not usually dangerous to creatures other than their
prey. Large sharks can reach around 15 feet in length and are a serious
threat. Huge sharks are true monsters, like great whites, that can
exceed 20 feet in length.

### Combat

their powerful jaws.

### Blindsense (Ex)
A shark can locate creatures underwater within a
30-foot radius. This ability works only when the shark is underwater.

### Keen Scent (Ex)
A shark can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot
radius and detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.

### Skills
A shark has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10

### Skills
Snakes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot
checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. A snake can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

Constrictor snakes usually are not aggressive and flee when confronted.
They hunt for food but do not attempt to make a meal out of any creature
that is too large to constrict.

#### Combat

Constrictor snakes hunt by grabbing prey with their mouths and then
squeezing it with their powerful bodies.

### Constrict (Ex)
On a successful grapple check, a constrictor snake
deals 1d3+4 points of damage.

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

These creatures range widely in size. They are not particularly
aggressive, but will often lash out with a bite attack before attempting
to retreat.

#### Combat

secondary damage of 1d6 Con. The save DC varies by the snake's size, as
shown on the table below. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

These free-swimming mollusks are fairly aggressive. They are more feared
than sharks in some locales.

### Combat

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a squid must hit an
opponent of any size with its arms attack. It can then attempt to start
a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and automatically
deals bite damage. \*A squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.

### Ink Cloud (Ex)
A squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet
high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action.
The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally uses to
escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.

### Jet (Ex)
A squid can jet backward once per round as a full-round
action, at a speed of 240 feet. It must move in a straight line, but
does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

### Skills
A squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line

These voracious creatures can have bodies more than 20 feet long and
attack almost anything they meet.

### Combat

An opponent can attack a giant squid's tentacles with a sunder attempt
as if they were weapons. A giant squid's tentacles have 10 hit points
each. If a giant squid is currently grappling a target with the tentacle
that is being attacked, it usually uses another limb to make its attack
of opportunity against the opponent making the sunder attempt. Severing
one of a giant squid's tentacles deals 5 points of damage to the
creature. A giant squid usually withdraws from combat if it loses five
tentacles. The creature regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.

### Constrict (Ex)
A giant squid deals 1d6+8 points of damage with a
successful grapple check.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a giant squid must hit an
opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can
constrict. \*A giant squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.

### Ink Cloud (Ex)
A giant squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 20
feet high by 20 feet wide by 20 feet long once per minute as a free
action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally
uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.

### Jet (Ex)
A giant squid can jet backward once per round as a
full-round action, at a speed of 320 feet. It must move in a straight
line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

### Skills
A giant squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

These little mammals are aggressive predators but usually confine
themselves to smaller prey. The statistics presented here can also apply
to ferrets.

### Combat

### Attach (Ex)
If a weasel hits with a bite attack, it uses its
powerful jaws to latch onto the opponent's body and automatically deals
bite damage each round it remains attached. An attached weasel loses its
Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and has an AC of 12. An attached weasel
can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached
weasel through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the
creature.

### Skills
Weasels have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks and a
+8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. They use their Dexterity
modifier for Climb checks. A weasel can always choose to take 10 on a
Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

## Whale

Some varieties of these seagoing mammals are among the largest animals
known. Relatively small whales (such as the orca presented here) can be
vicious predators, attacking virtually anything they detect.

### Blindsight (Ex)
Whales can "see" by emitting high-frequency sounds,
inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and
creatures within 120 feet. A *silence* spell negates this and forces the
whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a
human's.

### Hold Breath (Ex)
A whale can hold its breath for a number of rounds
equal to 8 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

### Skills
A whale has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. \*A whale
has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost
if its blindsight is negated.

The statistics here describe a plankton-feeding whale between 30 and 60
feet long, such as gray, humpback, and right whales. These massive
creatures are surprisingly gentle. If harassed or provoked, they are as
likely to flee as they are to retaliate.

Wolves are pack hunters known for their persistence and cunning.

### Combat

A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe's front
while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or rear.

### Trip (Ex)
A wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip
the opponent (+1 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch
attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the
opponent cannot react to trip the wolf.

### Skills
\*Wolves have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when
tracking by scent.
