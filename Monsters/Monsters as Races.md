# MONSTERS AS RACES

While every monsterhas the statistics that a player would need to play
the creature as a character, most monsters are not suitable as PCs.
Creatures who have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower, who have no way
to communicate, or who are so different from other PCs that they disrupt
the campaign should not be used. Some creatures have strange innate
abilities or great physical power, and thus are questionable at best as
characters (except in high-level campaigns).

### Starting Level of a Monster PC
Monsters suitable for play have a
level adjustment given in their statistics. Add a monster's level
adjustment to its Hit Dice and class levels to get the creature's
effective character level, or ECL. Effectively, monsters with a level
adjustment become multiclass character when they take class levels. A
creature's "monster class" is always a favored class, and the creature
never takes XP penalties for having it.

### Humanoids and Class Levels
Creatures with 1 or less HD replace
their monster levels with their character levels. The monster loses the
attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted by its 1
monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills, feats, and
other class abilities of a 1st-level character of the appropriate class.

Characters with more than 1 Hit Die because of their race do not get a
feat for their first class level as members of the common races do, and
they do not multiply the skill points for their first class level by
four. Instead, they have already received a feat for their first Hit Die
because of race, and they have already multiplied their racial skill
points for their first Hit Die by four.

### Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level
To determine the
effective character level (ECL) of a monster character, add its level
adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels.

Use ECL instead of character levelto determine how many experience
points a monster character needs to reach its next level. Also use ECL
to determine starting wealth for a monster character.

Monster characters treat skills mentioned in their monster entry as
class skills.

If a monster has 1 Hit Die or less, or if it is a template creature, it
must start the game with one or more class levels, like a regular
character. If a monster has 2 or more Hit Dice, it can start with no
class levels (though it can gain them later).

Even if the creature is of a kind that normally advances by Hit Dice
rather than class levels a PC can gain class levels rather than Hit
Dice.

### Hit Dice
The creature's Hit Dice equal the number of class levels
it has plus its racial Hit Dice. Additional Hit Dice gained from taking
levels in a character class never affect a creature's size like
additional racial Hit Dice do.

### Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases
A monster's total Hit
Dice, not its ECL, govern its acquisition of feats and ability score
increases.

### Ability Scores for Monster PCs
While a monsters statistics give the
ability scores for a typical creature of a certain kind, any "monster"
creature that becomes an adventurer is definitely not typical.
Therefore, when creating a PC from a creature, check to see if the
creature's entry has any ability scores of 10 or higher. If so, for each
score, subtract 10 (if the score is even) or 11 (if the score is odd) to
get the creature's modifier for that ability based on its race or kind.
Generate the character's ability scores as normal, then add the racial
ability modifiers to get their ability scores.

### Note
Some monsters have base ability scores other than 10 and 11.
If alternate scores were used this will be indicated in the monster
entry. Also, some monsters that make good PCs have their racial ability
modifiers and other traits already listed in their monster entry.

For ability scores lower than 10, the procedure is different. First,
determine the character's ability scores, and compare that number to the
monster's average ability score, using either the table below that
applies to Intelligence or the table that applies to the other five
ability scores.

The separate table for Intelligence ensures that no PC ends up with an
Intelligence score lower than 3. This is important, because creatures
with an Intelligence score lower than 3 are not playable characters.
Creatures with any ability score lower than 1 are also not playable.

### Other Statistics for Monsters
Creatures with Hit Dice of 1 or less
have normal, class-based Hit Dice and features. They get skills and
feats appropriate to a 1st-level character (even if they have a level
adjustment).

Those with 2 or more Hit Dice have statistics based on these Hit Dice
plus Hit Dice for class levels (if any).

### Experience for Monsters
A monster with Hit Dice of 1 or less, no
level adjustment, and class levels uses the same tables as standard PC
races when determining experience needed.

A monster with Hit Dice of 1 or less, a level adjustment, and class
levels adds its class levels, Hit Die, and level adjustment together
when determining experience needed (class level + HD + level
adjustment).

A monster with more than one Hit Die, a level adjustment, and class
levels adds its Hit Dice, class levels, and level adjustment together
when determining experience needed (HD + level adjustment + class
level).
