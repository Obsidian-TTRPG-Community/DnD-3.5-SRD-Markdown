# MONSTERS (VERMIN)

These creatures operate on instinct, driven by simple needs such as food
and reproduction. Except where noted, vermin attack only when hungry or
threatened.

### Vermin Traits
Vermin possess the following traits (unless otherwise
noted in a creature's entry).

---Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mind-affecting
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---*Alignment:* Always neutral. Vermin are not governed by a human sense
of morality.

---*Treasure:* Vermin generally possess no treasure. For those that do,
this treasure consists of possessions formerly owned by a creature that
the monster has killed.

### Poison (Ex)
A monstrous centipede has a poisonous bite. The details
vary by the centipede's size, as shown on the table above. The save DCs
are Constitution-based. The indicated damage is both initial and
secondary damage.

### Skills
Monstrous centipedes have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks,
and a +8 racial bonus on Climb and Hide checks. They can use either
their Strength or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks, whichever is
higher. Monstrous scorpions can take 10 on Climb checks, even if
threatened or distracted.

Monstrous scorpions are likely to attack any creature that approaches,
and they usually charge when attacking prey.

### Constrict (Ex)
A monstrous scorpion deals automatic claw damage on
a successful grapple check.

### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a monstrous scorpion must
hit with a claw attack. A monstrous scorpion can use either its Strength
modifier or Dexterity modifier for grapple checks, whichever is better.

### Poison (Ex)
A monstrous scorpion has a poisonous sting. The details
vary by the scorpion's size, as follows. The save DCs are Constitution-
based. The indicated damage is initial and secondary damage.

All monstrous spiders are aggressive predators that use their poisonous
bites to subdue or kill prey.

Monstrous spiders come in two general types: hunters and web-spinners.
Hunters rove about, while web-spinners usually attempt to trap prey.
Hunting spiders can spin webs to use as lairs, but cannot use their webs
as weapons the way web-spinners can. A hunting spider has a base land
speed 10 feet faster than the figures given in the statistics blocks.

### Poison (Ex)
A monstrous spider has a poisonous bite. The details
vary by the spider's size, as shown on the table below. The save DCs are
Constitution-based. The indicated damage is initial and secondary
damage.

  -------- --------- --------- ------------ --------- ---------
  Size     Fort DC   Damage    Size         Fort DC   Damage
  Tiny     10        1d2 Str   Huge         16        1d8 Str
  Small    10        1d3 Str   Gargantuan   20        2d6 Str
  Medium   12        1d4 Str   Colossal     28        2d8 Str
  Large    13        1d6 Str                          
  -------- --------- --------- ------------ --------- ---------

### Web (Ex)
Both types of monstrous spiders often wait in their webs
or in trees, then lower themselves silently on silk strands and leap
onto prey passing beneath. A single strand is strong enough to support
the spider and one creature of the same size. Web-spinners can throw a
web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has
a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is
effective against targets up to one size category larger than the
spider. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist
check or burst it with a Strength check. Both are standard actions whose
DCs are given in the table below. The check DCs are Constitution-based,
and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.

Web-spinners often create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet
square, depending on the size of the spider. They usually position these
sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the
ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to
notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as
though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the
webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on
or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has the hit points given
on the table, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/---.

A monstrous spider can move across its own web at its climb speed and
can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.

  ------------ ------------------ ---------- ------------
  Size         Escape Artist DC   Break DC   Hit Points
  Tiny         10                 14         2
  Small        10                 14         4
  Medium       12                 16         6
  Large        13                 17         12
  Huge         16                 20         14
  Gargantuan   20                 24         16
  Colossal     28                 32         18
  ------------ ------------------ ---------- ------------

### Tremorsense (Ex)
A monstrous spider can detect and pinpoint any
creature or object within 60 feet in contact with the ground, or within
any range in contact with the spider's webs.

### Skills
Monstrous spiders have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Spot
checks and a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. A monstrous spider can
always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.
Monstrous spiders use either their Strength or Dexterity modifier for
Climb checks, whichever is

higher. \*Hunting spiders have a +10 racial bonus on Jump checks and a
+8 racial bonus on Spot checks. Web-spinning spiders have a +8 racial
bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks when using their webs.
