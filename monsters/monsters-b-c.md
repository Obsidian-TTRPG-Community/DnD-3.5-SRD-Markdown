A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a
goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a goblin--wolf hybrid with
terrible jaws and sharp claws. As whelps, barghests are nearly
indistinguishable from wolves, except for their size and claws. As they
grow larger and stronger, their skin darkens to bluishred and eventually
becomes blue altogether.

A full-grown barghest is about 6 feet long and weighs 180 pounds. A
barghest's eyes glow orange when the creature becomes excited.

Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal.

### Combat {#barghest--combat}

Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their form, and usually
disdain weapons. Though they love killing, they have little stomach for
direct combat and attack from ambush whenever possible. Barghests start
a combat by using *crushing despair* and *charm monster* to keep
opponents off balance. They try to stay away from the enemy's main
strength.

A barghest's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*blink, levitate, misdirection* (DC
14), *rage* (DC 15); 1/day---*charm monster* (DC 16), *crushing despair*
(DC 16), *dimension door.* Caster level equals the barghest's HD.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Feed (Su):** When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on
the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action.
Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or
resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance
that a *wish, miracle,* or *true resurrection* spell can restore a
devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the
check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal
magic.

A barghest advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion.
For every three suitable corpses a barghest devours, it gains 1 Hit Die,
and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its
attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit
Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements
normally.

The barghest only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose
Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A
barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a
greater barghest upon completion of the act.

**Change Shape (Su):** A barghest can assume the shape of a goblin or a
wolf as a standard action. In goblin form, a barghest cannot use its
natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In wolf form, a
barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.

**Pass Without Trace (Ex):** A barghest in wolf form can use pass
without trace (as the spell) as a free action.

**Skills:** \*A barghest in wolf form gains a +4 circumstance bonus on
Hide checks.

### Greater Barghest

A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding becomes a greater
barghest. These creatures can change shape into a goblinlike creature of
Large size (about 8 feet tall and 400 pounds) or a dire wolf. In goblin
form, a greater barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield
weapons and wear armor. In dire wolf form, a greater barghest loses its
claw attacks but retains its bite attack.

A greater barghest can reach a maximum of 18 Hit Dice through feeding.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** In addition to the spelllike abilities all
barghests possess, a greater barghest gains the following abilities. At
will---*invisibility sphere;* 1/day---*mass bull's strength*, *mass
enlarge.* Caster level equals the greater barghest's HD.

#### Combat {#greater-barghest--combat}

Occasionally, a greater barghest uses a magic two-handed weapon in
combat instead of its claws, giving it multiple attacks (attack bonus
+13/+8). It can also make one bite attack (attack bonus +8) each round.
The save DC against a greater barghest's spell-like abilities is 14 +
spell level.

A basilisk is a reptilian monster that petrifies living creatures with a
mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish
underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An
adult basilisk's body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its
tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature
weighs about 300 pounds.

### Combat {#basilisk--combat}

A basilisk relies on its gaze attack, biting only when opponents come
within reach. Though it has eight legs, its slow metabolism renders it
relatively sluggish, so it does not expend energy unnecessarily.
Intruders who flee a basilisk rather than fight can expect, at best, a
halfhearted pursuit. These creatures tend to spend most of their time
lying in wait for prey, which includes small mammals, birds, reptiles,
and similar creatures.

**Petrifying Gaze (Su):** Turn to stone permanently, range 30 feet;
Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Skills:** \*The basilisk's dull coloration and its ability to remain
motionless for long periods of time grant it a +4 racial bonus on Hide
checks in natural settings.

### Abyssal Greater Basilisk

#### Combat {#abyssal-greater-basilisk--combat}

The save DC for the abyssal greater basilisk's petrifying gaze (DC 21)
is adjusted for its greater Hit Dice and higher Charisma score.

An abyssal greater basilisk's natural weapons are treated as magic
weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Smite Good (Su):** Once per day an abyssal greater basilisk can make a
normal melee attack to deal an extra 18 points of damage against a good
foe.

The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or use
its dozen legs to move with considerable speed. A behir is about 40 feet
long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. It can fold its limbs close to its
long, narrow body and slither in snake fashion if it desires. The
coloration of behirs ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of
gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back
over the head look dangerous but are actually used for preening the
creature's scales, not for fighting.

Behirs speak Common.

### Combat {#behir--combat}

A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows or
constricts the opponent. It can employ its claws only against foes
caught in its coils. If beset by a large number of foes, it uses its
breath weapon.

**Breath Weapon (Su):** 20-foot line, once every 10 rounds, damage 7d6
electricity, Reflex DC 19 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Constrict (Ex):** A behir deals 2d8+8 points of damage with a
successful grapple check. It can make six rake attacks against a
grappled foe as well.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a behir must hit a creature
of any size with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple
as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it it establishes a hold and can attempt
to constrict the opponent or swallow the opponent in the following
round.

**Rake (Ex):** Six claws, attack bonus +15 melee, damage 1d4+4.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** A behir can try to swallow a grabbed Medium or
smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check.

A behir that swallows an opponent can use its Cleave feat to bite and
grab another opponent.

A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8
points of acid damage per round from the behir's gizzard. A swallowed
creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing
weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the
creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out.

A behir's gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive
or smaller opponents.

**Skills:** Behirs have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always
choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

Belkers are creatures from the Plane of Air. They are composed primarily
of smoke. Although undeniably evil, they are very reclusive and usually
have no interest in the affairs of others. A belker's winged shape makes
it look distinctly demonic. It is about 7 feet long and weighs about 8
pounds.

Belkers speak Auran.

### Combat {#belker--combat}

In most cases, a belker fights with its nasty claws and painful bite.

**Smoke Claws (Ex):** A belker in smoke form (see below) can engulf
opponents by moving on top of them. It fills the air around one Medium
or smaller opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity. The
target must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or inhale part of the
creature. The save DC is Constitution-based. Smoke inside the victim
solidifies into a claw and begins to rip at the surrounding organs,
dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. An affected creature can attempt
another Fortitude save each subsequent round to cough out the
semivaporous menace.

**Smoke Form (Su):** Most of the time a belker is more or less solid,
but at will it can assume smoke form. It can switch forms once per round
as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in smoke form. A
belker in smoke form can fly at a speed of 50 feet (perfect). The
ability is otherwise similar to a *gaseous form* spell (caster level
7th).

**Skills:** Belkers have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited teleportation
ability.

Blink dogs have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps, whines,
and growls that can transmit complex information.

### Combat {#blink-dog--combat}

Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in a seemingly random fashion
until they surround their prey, allowing some of them to take advantage
of flanking.

**Blink (Su):** A blink dog can use *blink* as the spell (caster level
8th), and can evoke or end the effect as a free action.

**Dimension Door (Su):** A blink dog can teleport, as *dimension door*
(caster level 8th), once per round as a free action. The ability affects
only the blink dog, which never appears within a solid object and can
act immediately after teleporting.

Humanoids who die from this attack are transformed into bodaks 24 hours
later. The save DC is Charisma-based.

merest touch burns their impure flesh. Each round of exposure to the
direct rays of the sun deals 1 point of damage to the creature.

In addition to their natural form, bralanis can assume the shape of a
whirlwind or zephyr of dust, snow, or sand.

Bralanis speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate
with almost any creature, thanks to their *tongues* ability.

### Combat {#bralani--combat}

Bralanis prefer the scimitar and bow, the weapons of the desert nomads
they most closely resemble.

A bralani's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will--- *blur, charm person* (DC 13), *gust
of wind* (DC 14), *mirror image, wind wall;* 2/day---*lightning bolt*
(DC 15), *cure serious wounds* (DC 15). Caster level 6th. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

**Whirlwind Blast (Su):** When in whirlwind form, a bralani can attack
with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of damage in a 20-foot
line (Reflex DC 16 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Alternate Form (Su):** A bralani can shift between its humanoid and
whirlwind forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or
use its whirlwind blast, but it can use its spell-like abilities and its
weapons. In whirlwind form, it can fly, make slam attacks and whirlwind
blast attacks, and use spell-like abilities.

A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A
change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any
particular form when killed. A *true seeing* spell, however, reveals
both forms simultaneously.

**Tongues (Su):** Bralanis can speak with any creature that has a
language, as though using a *tongues* spell (caster level 14th). This
ability is always active.

Also known as the landshark, the bulette is a terrifying predator that
lives only to eat.

### Combat {#bulette--combat}

A bulette attacks anything it regards as edible, choosing the easiest or
closest prey first. The only creatures it refuses to eat are elves (and
it dislikes the taste of dwarves). When burrowing underground, a
landshark relies on its tremorsense ability to detect prey.

When it senses something edible (that is, senses movement), it breaks to
the surface, crest first, and begins its attack.

**Leap (Ex):** A bulette can jump into the air during combat. This
allows it to make four claw attacks instead of two, each with a +15
attack bonus, but it cannot bite.

## Celestial Creature

Celestial creatures dwell on the upper planes, the realms of good,
although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more
regal and more beautiful than their earthly counterparts.

Celestial creatures often come in metallic colors (usually silver, gold,
or platinum). They can be mistaken for half-celestials, more powerful
creatures that are created when a celestial mates with a non-celestial
creature.

### Creating a Celestial Creature

"Celestial" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal
animal, aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast,
monstrous humanoid, plant, or vermin of good or neutral alignment
(referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A celestial creature uses all the base creature's statistics and
abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit
Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes.

**Size and Type:** Animals or vermin with this template become magical
beasts, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged.
Celestial creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the
extraplanar subtype.

**Special Attacks:** A celestial creature retains all the special
attacks of the base creature and also gains the following attack.

*Smite Evil (Su):* Once per day a celestial creature can make a normal
melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20)
against an evil foe.

**Special Qualities:** A celestial creature retains all the special
qualities of the base creature and also gains the following qualities.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Damage reduction (see the table below).

---Resistance to acid, cold, and electricity (see the table below).

---Spell resistance equal to HD + 5 (maximum 25).

The horrific creatures known as chaos beasts have mutable, ever-changing
forms. A chaos beast's dimensions vary, but it always weighs about 200
pounds.

Chaos beasts do not speak.

### Combat {#chaos-beast--combat}

For all its fearsome appearances, whether it has claws, fangs, pincers,
tentacles, or spines, a chaos beast does little physical harm.
Regardless of form, the creature seems unable to manage more than two
attacks per round. Its continual transmutations prevent the coordination
needed to do more.

A chaos beast's claw attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

**Corporeal Instability (Su):** A blow from a chaos beast against a
living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must
succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass.
Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape
melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC is Constitution-based.

An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor,
rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried---armor,
backpacks, even shirts---hamper more than help, reducing the victim's
Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10
feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses
along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The
victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly,
unable to distinguish friend from foe (--4 penalty on attack rolls and a
50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).

Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of
Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom score falls to 0,
it becomes a chaos beast.

A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt
a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast
with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the
creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still
repeat this check each round until successful.

Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to
remove. A *shapechange* or *stoneskin* spell does not cure an afflicted
creature but fixes its form for the duration of the spell. A
*restoration, heal,* or *greater restoration* spell removes the
affliction (a separate *restoration* is necessary to restore any drained
points of Wisdom).

**Immunity to Transformation (Ex):** No mortal magic can permanently
affect or fix a chaos beast's form. Effects such as polymorphing or
petrification force the creature into a new shape, but at the start of
its next turn it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free
action.

A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and
weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera's dragon head might be black, blue,
green, red, or white.

Chimeras can speak Draconic but seldom bother to do so, except when
toadying to more powerful creatures.

### Combat {#chimera--combat}

The chimera prefers to surprise prey. It often swoops down from the sky
or lies concealed until it charges. The dragon head can loose a breath
weapon instead of biting. Several chimeras attack in concert.

**Breath Weapon (Su):** A chimera's breath weapon depends on the color
of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its
type, a chimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals
3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 17 Reflex save for half damage.
The save DC is Constitution-based.

To determine a chimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll
1d10 and consult the table below.

  ------- ------------ ----------------------------
  1d10    Head Color   Breath Weapon
  1--2    Black        40-foot line of acid
  3--4    Blue         40-foot line of lightning
  5--6    Green        20-foot cone of gas (acid)
  7--8    Red          20-foot cone of fire
  9--10   White        20-foot cone of cold
  ------- ------------ ----------------------------

**Skills:** A chimera's three heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Spot
and Listen checks.

\*In areas of scrubland or brush, a chimera gains a +4 racial bonus on
Hide checks.

**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a chimera is up to 348 pounds; a
medium load, 349--699 pounds, and a heavy load, 700--1,050 pounds.

These vicious little predators lurk underground, grabbing whatever prey
happens by. Its hands and feet have spiny pads that help the choker grip
almost any surface. The creature weighs about 35 pounds.

Chokers speak Undercommon.

### Combat {#choker--combat}

A choker likes to perch near the ceiling, often at intersections,
archways, wells, or staircases, and reach down to attack its prey. A
choker attacks creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of
its size or larger. If one is very hungry, it may attack a group, but it
waits to grab the last creature in line.

**Constrict (Ex):** A choker deals 1d3+3 points of damage with a
successful grapple check against a Large or smaller creature. Because it
seizes its victim by the neck, a creature in the choker's grasp cannot
speak or cast spells with verbal components.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a choker must hit a Large
or smaller opponent with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start
a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Chokers receive a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks, which is already
included in the statistics block.

**Quickness (Su):** Although not particularly dexterous, a choker is
supernaturally quick. It can take an extra standard action or move
action during its turn each round.

**Skills:** A chokers has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------

A horrible mix of crustacean, insect, and serpent, the chuul is an
abomination that lurks submerged or partially submerged, awaiting
intelligent prey to devour. Although amphibious, chuuls are not good
swimmers and actually prefer to be on land or in very shallow water when
they attack. A chuul is about 8 feet long and weighs 650 pounds.

Chuuls speak Common (or Undercommon, for the underground variety).

### Combat {#chuul--combat}

A chuul prefers to wait by the shore, submerged in murky water, until it
hears nearby prey (in or out of the water) that it can attack with
surprise. A chuul grabs with its claws and constricts its foe, then
passes the opponent to its paralytic tentacles. It tries to always have
one claw free, so if it faces a large number of opponents, it drops a
paralyzed or dead victim and continues attempting to grab, constrict,
and paralyze the rest.

**Constrict (Ex):** On a successful grapple check, a chuul deals 3d6+5
points of damage.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a chuul must hit with a
claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict or on its next turn
transfer a grabbed opponent to its tentacles.

**Paralytic Tentacles (Ex):** A chuul can transfer grabbed victims from
a claw to its ten- tacles as a move action. The tentacles grapple with
the same strength as the claw but deal no damage. However, they exude a
paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a DC
19 Fortitude save each round on the chuul's turn or be paralyzed for 6
rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles,
paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes 1d8+2 points of damage
each round from the creature's mandibles.

**Amphibious (Ex):** Although chuuls are aquatic, they can survive
indefinitely on land.

**Skills:** A chuul has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

When resting or lying in wait, these creatures are almost impossible to
distinguish from common black cloaks (the cloaker's ivory claws look
very much like bone clasps). Only when it unfurls does the horrific
nature of the creature become apparent.

A cloaker has a wingspan of about 8 feet. It weighs about 100 pounds.

Cloakers speak Undercommon.

### Combat {#cloaker--combat}

Cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for prey. If facing a
single opponent, a cloaker uses its engulf attack. Against multiple
foes, it lashes with its tail in concert with its moan and shadow shift
abilities to reduce the opposition's numbers, then engulfs a survivor.
Multiple cloakers usually split up, leaving one or two behind to use
special abilities while the rest make melee attacks.

**Moan (Ex):** A cloaker can emit a dangerous subsonic moan as a
standard action. By changing the frequency, the cloaker can cause one of
four effects. Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mindaffecting attacks.
Unless otherwise specified, a creature that successfully saves against
one of these effects cannot be affected by the same moan effect from the
same cloaker for 24 hours. All save DCs for moan effects are
Charisma-based.

*Unnerve:* Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a --2
penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced to hear the moan for
more than 6 consecutive rounds must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or
enter a trance, unable to attack or defend themselves until the moaning
stops.

*Fear:* Anyone within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will save
or become panicked for 2 rounds.

*Nausea:* Anyone in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude
save or be overcome by nausea and weakness.

Affected characters fall prone and become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds.

*Stupor:* A single creature within 30 feet of the cloaker must succeed
on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a *hold monster*
spell for 5 rounds. Even after a successful save, the creature must
repeat the save if the cloaker uses this effect again.

**Engulf (Ex):** A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature
in its body as a standard action. The cloaker attempts a grapple that
does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,
it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on
its attack roll. It can still use its whiplike tail to strike at other
targets.

Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the
monster and half to the trapped victim.

**Shadow Shift (Su):** A cloaker can manipulate shadows. This ability is
effective only in shadowy areas and has three possible effects.

*Obscure Vision:* The cloaker gains concealment (20% miss chance) for
1d4 rounds.

*Dancing Images:* This effect duplicates a *mirror image* spell (caster
level 6th).

*Silent Image:* This effect duplicates a *silent image* spell (DC 15,
caster level 6th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

A male cockatrice has wattles and a comb, just like a rooster. Females,
much rarer than males, differ only in that they have no wattles or comb.
A cockatrice weighs about 25 pounds.

### Combat {#cockatrice--combat}

A cockatrice fiercely attacks anything that it deems a threat to itself
or its lair. Flocks of cockatrices do their utmost to overwhelm and
confuse their foes, and sometimes fly directly into their opponents'
faces.

**Petrification (Su):** Creatures hit by a cockatrice's bite attack must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or instantly turn to stone. The save
DC is Constitution-based. Cockatrices have immunity to the petrification
ability of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect
them normally.

A couatl is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of about 15 feet. It
weighs about 1,800 pounds.

Couatls speak Celestial, Common, and Draconic, and also have the power
of telepathy (see below).

### Combat {#couatl--combat}

A couatl uses its *detect thoughts* ability on any creature that arouses
its suspicions. Since it is highly intelligent, a couatl usually casts
spells from a distance before closing. If more than one couatl is
involved, they discuss their strategy before a battle.

**Constrict (Ex):** A couatl deals 2d8+6 points of damage with a
successful grapple check.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a couatl must hit a
creature of up to two size categories larger with its bite attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking
an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a
hold and can constrict.

**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial damage 2d4 Str,
secondary damage 4d4 Str.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Psionics (Sp):** At will---*detect chaos, detect evil, detect good,
detect law, detect thoughts* (DC 15), *invisibility, plane shift* (DC
20), *polymorph* (self only). Effective caster level 9th. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

**Spells:** A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.

It can choose its spells known from the sorcerer list, the cleric list,
and from the lists for the Air, Good, and Law domains. The cleric spells
and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning
that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.

*Typical Spells Known* (6/7/7/7/4; save DC 13 + spell level): 0---*cure
minor wounds, daze, disrupt undead, light, obscuring mist, ray of frost,
read magic, resistance;* 1st---*endure elements, mage armor, protection
from chaos, true strike, wind wall;* 2nd---*cure moderate wounds,
eagle's splendor, scorching ray, silence;* 3rd---*gaseous form, magic
circle against evil, summon monster III;* 4th--- *charm monster, freedom
of movement.*

**Ethereal Jaunt (Su):** This ability works like the *ethereal jaunt*
spell (caster level 16th).

**Telepathy (Su):** A couatl can communicate telepathically with any
creature within 90 feet that has an Intelligence score. The creature can
respond to the couatl if it wishes---no common language is needed.
