  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their
skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing
consists of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally
repellent odor.

Ogres speak Giant, and those specimens who boast Intelligence scores of
at least 10 also speak Common.

### Combat {#ogre--combat}

Ogres favor overwhelming odds, sneak attacks, and ambushes over a fair
fight. They are intelligent enough to fire ranged weapons first to
soften up their foes before closing, but ogre gangs and bands fight as
unorganized individuals.

### Ogre Barbarian

Their inherent bent toward chaos combines with their size and strength
to make ogres natural barbarians. Indeed, their leaders are almost
always barbarians of low to middle level, monstrous brutes whose fury in
battle is truly fearsome. A raging ogre barbarian is an inspiration to
other ogres.

#### Combat {#ogre-barbarian--combat}

Marginally more intelligent than his brutish fellows, an ogre barbarian
is slightly more likely to enter a fair fight, but in general prefers
the brutish tactics common to all its kind.

**Rage (Ex):** Twice per day, an ogre barbarian can enter a state of
fierce rage that last for 9 rounds. The following changes are in effect
as long as he rages: AC 17 (touch 8, flat-footed 17); hp 95; Atk +18/+13
melee (2d6+16, *+1 greatclub*); SV Fort +14, Will +4; Str 30, Con 22;
Climb +15, Jump +16. At the end of his rage, the ogre barbarian is
fatigued for the duration of the encounter.

**Trap Sense (Ex):** An ogre barbarian has a +1 bonus on Reflex saves
made to avoid traps. He also has a +1 bonus to his AC against attacks by
traps.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** An ogre barbarian retains his Dex bonus to AC
regardless of being caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible
opponent. His Dex bonus to AC is +0, but this means that he is not
subject to a rogue's sneak attack in these circumstances.

### Merrow

These cousins of the ogre have the aquatic subtype.

They dwell in freshwater lakes and rivers. They have a base land speed
of 30 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet and are found only in aquatic
environments.

Instead of the typical ogre's greatclub, they prefer to use longspears
in melee (attack +8 melee, damage 1d8+7).

### Ogres as Characters

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ogre mage is a more intelligent and dangerous variety of its mundane
cousin.

An ogre mage stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 700 pounds. Its
skin varies in color from light green to light blue, and its hair is
black or very dark brown. Ogre mages favor loose, comfortable clothing
and lightweight armor.

Ogre mages speak Giant and Common.

### Combat {#ogre-mage--combat}

Ogre mages rely on their spell-like abilities, resorting to physical
combat only when necessary. When faced with obviously superior forces,
they prefer to retreat using *gaseous form* rather than fight a losing
battle.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*darkness, invisibility;* 1/day---
*charm person* (DC 14)*, cone of cold* (DC 18)*, gaseous form,
polymorph, sleep* (DC 14). Caster level 9th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

**Flight (Su):** An ogre mage can cease or resume flight as a free
action. While using *gaseous form* it can fly at its normal speed and
has perfect maneuverability.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Fire and acid deal normal damage to an ogre mage.

An ogre mage that loses a limb or body part can reattach it by holding
the severed member to the stump. Reattachment takes 1 minute. If the
head or some other vital organ is severed, it must be reattached within
10 minutes or the creature dies. An ogre mage cannot regrow lost body
parts.

### Ogre Mages as Characters

Ogre mage characters possess the following racial traits.

--- +10 Strength, +6 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +6
Charisma.

---Large size. --1 penalty to Armor Class, --1 penalty on attack rolls,
--4 penalty on Hide checks, +4 bonus on grapple checks, lifting and
carrying limits double those of Medium characters.

---Space/Reach: 10 feet/10 feet.

---An ogre mage's base land speed is 40 feet. It also has a fly speed of
40 feet (good).

---Darkvision: Ogre mages can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

---Racial Hit Dice: An ogre mage begins with five levels of giant, which
provide 5d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +3, and base saving throw
bonuses of Fort +4, Ref +1, and Will +1.

---Racial Skills: An ogre mage's giant levels give it skill points equal
to 8 x (2 + Int modifier \[minimum 1\]). Its class skills are
Concentration, Listen, Spellcraft, and Spot.

---Racial Feats: An ogre mage's giant levels give it two feats.

--- +5 natural armor bonus.

---Special Attacks (see above): Spell-like abilities.

---Special Qualities (see above): Regeneration 5, spell resistance 19.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Giant. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Goblin,
Infernal, Orc.

---Favored Class: Sorcerer.

---Level adjustment +7.

## Ooze

Oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit
underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and
dungeons in search of organic matter---living or dead.

### Combat {#ooze--combat}

Oozes attack any creatures they encounter. They lash out with pseudopods
or simply engulf opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that
help them catch or digest their prey.

**Blindsight (Ex):** An ooze's entire body is a primitive sensory organ
that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.

The typical black pudding measures 15 feet across and 2 feet thick. It
weighs about 18,000 pounds.

#### Combat {#black-pudding--combat}

A black pudding attacks by grabbing and squeezing their prey.

**Acid (Ex):** The creature secretes a digestive acid that dissolves
organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Any melee
hit or constrict attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's armor and
clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless they succeed on
DC 21 Reflex saves. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a black
pudding also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex
save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

The pudding's acidic touch deals 21 points of damage per round to wooden
or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object
for 1 full round to deal this damage.

**Constrict (Ex):** A black pudding deals automatic slam and acid damage
with a successful grapple check. The opponent's clothing and armor take
a --4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a black pudding must hit
with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

**Split (Ex):** Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a black
pudding. Instead the creature splits into two identical puddings, each
with half of the original's current hit points (round down). A pudding
with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced
to 0 hit points.

**Skills:** A black pudding has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and
can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or
threatened.

### Elder Black Pudding

The most ancient black puddings are vast pools of inky death.

#### Combat {#elder-black-pudding--combat}

The save DC for the elder black pudding's acid attack (DC 29) is
adjusted for its additional Hit Dice and higher Constitution score.

The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon
corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash.
Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the cube's body.

A typical gelatinous cube is 15 feet on a side and weighs about 50,000
pounds, though much larger specimens are not unknown.

#### Combat {#gelatinous-cube--combat}

A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It is
capable of lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes.

**Acid (Ex):** A gelatinous cube's acid does not harm metal or stone.

**Engulf (Ex):** Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can simply
mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make
a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube
merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can
cover. Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the cube, but if
they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not
attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex save or be
engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's
choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the
cube's paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped
within its body. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial
bonus.

**Paralysis (Ex):** A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing slime. A
target hit by a cube's melee or engulf attack must succeed on a DC 20
Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can
automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

**Transparent (Ex):** Gelatinous cubes are hard to see, even under ideal
conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who
fail to notice a cube and walk into it are automatically engulfed.

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

A gray ooze can grow to a diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of
about 6 inches. A typical specimen weighs about 700 pounds.

#### Combat {#gray-ooze--combat}

A gray ooze strikes like a snake, slamming opponents with its body.

**Acid (Ex):** A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly
dissolves organic material and metal, but not stone. Any melee hit or
constrict attack deals acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and
becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A
metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze also dissolves
immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. The save DCs are
Constitution-based.

The ooze's acidic touch deals 16 points of damage per round to wooden or
metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1
full round to deal this damage.

**Constrict (Ex):** A gray ooze deals automatic slam and acid damage
with a successful grapple check. The opponent's clothing and armor take
a --4 penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a gray ooze must hit with
its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

**Transparent (Ex):** A gray ooze is hard to identify, even under ideal
conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who
fail to notice a gray ooze and walk into it are automatically hit with a
melee attack for slam and acid damage.

An ochre jelly can grow to a diameter of about 15 feet and a thickness
of about 6 inches, but can compress its body to fit into cracks as small
as 1 inch wide. A typical specimen weighs about 5,600 pounds.

#### Combat {#ochre-jelly--combat}

An ochre jelly attempts to envelop and squeeze its prey.

**Acid (Ex):** An ochre jelly secretes a digestive acid that dissolves
only flesh. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage.

**Constrict (Ex):** An ochre jelly deals automatic slam and acid damage
with a successful grapple check.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, an ochre jelly must hit
with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

**Split (Ex):** Slashing and piercing weapons and electricity attacks
deal no damage to an ochre jelly. Instead the creature splits into two
identical jellies, each with half of the original's current hit points
(round down). A jelly with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split
and dies if reduced to 0 it points.

**Skills:** An ochre jelly has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

An orc's hair usually is black. It has lupine ears and reddish eyes.
Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider
unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep
purple. Their equipment is dirty and unkempt. An adult male orc is a
little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds.

Females are slightly smaller.

The language an orc speaks varies slightly from tribe to tribe, but any
orc is understandable by someone else who speaks Orc. Some orcs know
Goblin or Giant as well.

Most orcs encountered away from their homes are warriors; the
information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.

### Combat {#orc--combat}

Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that cause
the most damage in the least time. Many orcs who take up the warrior or
fighter class also gain proficiency with the falchion or the greataxe as
a martial weapon. They enjoy attacking from concealment and setting
ambushes, and they obey the rules of war (such as honoring a truce) only
as long as it is convenient for them.

**Light Sensitivity (Ex):** Orcs are dazzled in bright sunlight or
within the radius of a *daylight* spell.

### Orcs as Characters

**Orc Traits (Ex):** Orcs possess the following racial traits.

--- +4 Strength, --2 Intelligence, --2 Wisdom, --2 Charisma.

---An orc's base land speed is 30 feet.

---Darkvision out to 60 feet.

---Light Sensitivity: Orcs are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the
radius of a *daylight* spell.

---Automatic Languages: Common, Orc. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Giant,
Gnoll, Goblin, Undercommon.

---Favored Class: Barbarian.

The orc warrior presented here had the following ability scores before
racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### Half-Orcs

These orc--human crossbreeds can be found in either orc or human society
(where their status varies according to local sentiments), or in
communities of their own. Half-orcs usually inherit a good blend of the
physical characteristics of their parents. They are as tall as humans
and a little heavier, thanks to their muscle. They have greenish
pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and
coarse body hair. Half-orcs who have lived among or near orcs have
scars, in keeping with orcish tradition.

**Half-Orc Traits (Ex):** Half-orcs possess the following racial traits.

--- +2 Strength, --2 Intelligence, --2 Charisma.

---Medium size.

---A half-orc's base land speed is 30 feet.

---Orc Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-orc is considered
an orc.

Gnoll, Goblin, Abyssal.

---Favored Class: Barbarian.

Giant owls are nocturnal birds of prey, feared for their ability to hunt
and attack in near silence. They are intelligent, and though naturally
suspicious, sometimes associate with good creatures. A typical giant owl
stands about 9 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and resembles
its smaller cousins in nearly every way except size.

Giant owls speak Common and Sylvan.

### Combat {#owl-giant--combat}

A giant owl attacks by gliding silently just a few feet above its prey
and plunging to strike when directly overhead.

**Superior Low-Light Vision (Ex):** A giant owl can see five times as
far as a human can in dim light.

**Skills:** Giant owls have a +8 racial bonus on Listen checks and a +4
racial bonus on Spot checks.

\*When in flight, giant owls gain a +8 bonus on Move Silently checks.

### Training a Giant Owl

Although intelligent, a giant owl requires training before it can bear a
rider in combat. To be trained, a giant owl must have a friendly
attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful
Diplomacy check). Training a friendly giant owl requires six weeks of
work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a giant owl requires an
exotic saddle. A giant owl can fight while carrying a rider, but the
rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Giant owl eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while
chicks are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to
rear or train a giant owl.

**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a giant owl is up to 300 pounds;
a medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the
cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild
and shy creatures not easily tamed.

A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500
pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Pegasi cannot speak, but they
understand Common.

### Combat {#pegasus--combat}

within a 60-foot radius. Caster level 5th.

**Skills:** Pegasi have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

### Training a Pegasus

Although intelligent, a pegasus requires training before it can bear a
rider in combat. To be trained, a pegasus must have a friendly attitude
toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy
check). Training a friendly pegasus requires six weeks of work and a DC
25 Handle Animal check. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle. A
pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also
attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Pegasus eggs are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are
worth 3,000 gp per head. Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses.
Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which
serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.

**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a
medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a cluster
of nodules atop the main mass, though it is visible only when dead. A
cluster of nodules atop the main mass serve as sensory organs. The
creature feeds and attacks with a gaping maw lined with rows of teeth.
Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it to move about. This
ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared predator
among subterranean inhabitants.

### Combat {#phantom-fungus--combat}

A phantom fungus usually roams quietly, hunting for prey. It attacks
lone individuals almost anywhere, but when tackling groups it prefers an
open space where it has a better chance .

**Greater Invisibility (Su):** This ability is constant, allowing a
phantom fungus to remain invisible even when attacking. It works like
*greater invisibility* (caster level 12th) and lasts as long as the
phantom fungus is alive. This ability is not subject to the
*invisibility purge* spell. A phantom fungus becomes visible 1 minute
after it is killed.

**Skills:** A phantom fungus has a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently
checks.

Phase spiders are aggressive predators that can move quickly from the
Ethereal Plane to attack opponents on the Material Plane.

A typical phase spider's body is 8 feet long. It weighs about 700
pounds.

Phase spiders cannot speak.

### Combat {#phase-spider--combat}

Phase spiders dwell and hunt on the Material Plane. Once a spider
locates prey, however, it shifts to the Ethereal Plane to attack,
attempting to catch its victim flat-footed. The spider shifts in, bites
its victim, and retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane.

**Ethereal Jaunt (Su):** A phase spider can shift from the Ethereal
Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a
move action (or during a move action). The ability is otherwise
identical with *ethereal jaunt* (caster level 15th).

**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage
1d8 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Skills:** A phase spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

A phasm is an amorphous creature that can assume the guise of almost any
other creature or object. A phasm in its natural form is about 5 feet in
diameter and 2 feet high at the center. Swirls of color indicate sensory
organs. In this form, a phasm slithers about like an ooze and can attack
with a pseudopod. It weighs about 400 pounds.

Phasms can speak Common but prefer telepathic communication.

### Combat {#phasm--combat}

When faced with potential danger, a phasm is equally likely to retreat,
parley, or attack, as its fancy strikes.

If pursued or harassed, a phasm transforms into the most fearsome
creature it knows and attacks. When seriously hurt, it changes to some
fast or agile form and tries to escape.

**Amorphous (Ex):** A phasm in its natural form has immunity to poison,
*sleep,* paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. It is not subject
to critical hits and, having no clear front or back, cannot be flanked.

**Resilient (Ex):** A phasm has a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude and
Reflex saves (included in the statistics block).

Alternate Form (Su): A phasm can assume any form of Large size or
smaller as a standard action. This ability functions as a *polymorph*
spell cast on itself (caster level 15th), except that the phasm does not
regain hit points for changing form. A phasm can remain in its alternate
form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.

**Tremorsense (Ex):** A phasm can automatically sense the location of
anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground, so long as
it is touching the ground itself.

**Skills:** \*When using shapechange, a phasm gains a +10 circumstance
bonus on Disguise checks.

## Planetouched

Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can trace his or
her bloodline back to an outsider, usually a fiend or celestial.

The effects of having a supernatural being in one's heritage last for
many generations. Although not as dramatically altered as a
half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special
qualities.

The two planetouched varieties described here are the most common.
Aasimars are humans with some trace of celestial blood in their veins,
and tieflings have some fiendishness in their family tree.

Aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and generally pleasant. Some
have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as silver
hair, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare.

Most aasimars are decidedly good-aligned. They fight against evil causes
and attempt to sway others to do the right thing. Occasionally they take
on the vengeful, judgmental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this
is rare.

#### Combat {#aasimar--combat}

Aasimars usually like a fair, straightforward contest. Against a
particularly evil foe, however, they fight with utter conviction and to
the death.

***Daylight* (Sp):** An aasimar can use day*light* once per day as a
1^st^-level caster or a caster of his class levels, whichever is higher.

The body of a mature purple worm is 5 feet in diameter and 80 feet long,
weighing about 40,000 pounds. The creature has a poisonous stinger in
its tail.

### Combat {#purple-worm--combat}

In battle, a purple worm forms into a coil 20 feet in diameter, biting
and stinging anything within reach.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a purple worm must hit with
its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can attempt to swallow the foe the
following round.

**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 25, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** A purple worm can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of a smaller size than itself by making a successful grapple
check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of crushing damage
plus 8 points of acid damage per round from the worm's gizzard. A
swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or
piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 17). Once
the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan worm's interior can hold
2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller
opponents.

**Skills:** A purple worm has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands are
where the backs of the hands would be on a human.

A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human.

Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon.

### Combat {#rakshasa--combat}

In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its
sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever possible, it uses its other
abilities to make such encounters unnecessary.

**Detect Thoughts (Su):** A rakshasa can continuously use detect
thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can
suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

**Spells:** A rakshasa casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.

*Typical Sorcerer Spells Known* (6/7/7/5; save DC 13 + spell level):
0---*detect magic, light, mage hand, message, read magic, resistance,
touch of fatigue;* 1st---*charm person, mage armor, magic missile,
shield, silent image;* 2nd---*bear's endurance, invisibility, acid
arrow;* 3rd---*haste, suggestion.*

**Change Shape (Su):** A rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or
revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a
rakshasa loses its claw and bite attacks (although it often equips
itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains in one form
until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be
dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form when killed. A
*true seeing* spell reveals its natural form.

**Skills:** A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise
checks. \*When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10
circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If reading an opponent's mind,
its circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by a
further +4.

A rast has anywhere from ten to fifteen claws, though it can only use
four at once.

A rast has a body about the size of a large dog's, with a head almost as
large as the body. It weighs about 200 pounds.

### Combat {#rast--combat}

are still moving. A rast can claw or bite, but cannot do both during the
same round.

DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity.

**Blood Drain (Ex):** A rast drains blood from a grabbed opponent,
dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round it maintains the hold.

**Flight (Su):** A rast can cease or resume flight as a free action. A

Ravids are creatures from the Positive Energy Plane. These bizarre
entities imbue creatures with energy by their touch and animate lifeless
objects around them. Ravids that make their way to the Material Plane
wander about aimlessly, followed by the objects to which they have given
life.

A ravid is about 7 feet long and weighs about 75 pounds.

### Combat {#ravid--combat}

Ravids fight only in self-defense. A ravid itself is not very powerful
but is always accompanied by at least one animated object that defends
it.

**Positive Energy Lash (Su):** A ravid can make a touch attack or hit
with a claw or tail slap attack to infuse a target with positive energy.
The energy produces an unpleasant tingle in living creatures, and
against undead foes (even incorporeal ones) it deals 2d10 points of
damage.

Animate Objects (Su): Once per round, a random object within 20 feet of
a ravid animates as though by the spell *animate objects* (caster level
20th). These objects defend the ravid to the best of their ability, but
the ravid isn't intelligent enough to employ elaborate tactics with
them.

**Flight (Su):** A ravid can cease or resume flight as a free action. A
rast that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action
(either a move action or an attack action) each round.

**Feats:** A ravid has the Multiattack feat even through it does not
have the requisite three natural weapons.

A remorhaz is whitish-blue in color but pulses with a reddish glow from
the heat its body produces. The creature is a little more than 20 feet
long, with a body about 5 feet wide. It weighs about 10,000 pounds.

Remorhazes cannot speak.

### Combat {#remorhaz--combat}

Remorhazes hide under the snow and ice until they hear movement above
them, then attack from below and surprise prey.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a remorhaz must hit an
opponent least one size category smaller than itself with its bite
attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and can attempt to swallow the opponent the following
round.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** When a remorhaz begins its turn with a grappled
opponent in its mouth, it can swallow that opponent with a successful
grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of
bludgeoning damage plus 8d6 points of fire damage per round from the
remorhaz's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a
light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the
gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the
hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge
remorhaz's interior can hold 2 Large, 4 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, 128
Diminutive, or 512 Fine or smaller opponents.

**Heat (Ex):** An enraged remorhaz generates heat so intense that
anything touching its body takes 8d6 points of fire damage. Creatures
striking a remorhaz with natural attacks or unarmed attacks are subject
to this damage, but creatures striking with melee weapons do not take
damage from the remorhaz's heat. This heat can melt or char weapons; any
weapon that strikes a remorhaz is allowed a DC 18 Fortitude save to
avoid destruction. The save DC is Constitution-based. Skills: Remorhazes
have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.

A roc's plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. These
enormous creatures are 30 feet long from the beak to the base of the
tail, with wingspans as wide as 80 feet. A roc weighs about 8,000
pounds.

### Combat {#roc--combat}

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its
powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. A
solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any Medium or larger
creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert,
fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings.

**Skills:** Rocs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A roper stands some 9 feet tall and tapers from 3 or 4 feet in diameter
at the base to 1 foot across at the top. It weighs 2,200 pounds. A
roper's coloration and temperature change to match the features of the
surrounding cave.

Ropers speak Terran and Undercommon.

### Combat {#roper--combat}

A roper hunts by standing very still and imitating a bit of rock. This
tactic often allows it to attack with surprise. When prey comes within
reach, it lashes out with its strands. In melee, it bites adjacent
opponents with its powerful maw.

**Drag (Ex):** If a roper hits with a strand attack, the strand latches
onto the opponent's body. This deals no damage but drags the stuck
opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of
opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which requires a DC 23
Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check. The check DCs are
Strength-based, and the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial bonus. A
roper can draw in a creature within 10 feet of itself and bite with a +4
attack bonus in the same round. A strand has 10 hit points and can be
attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a
roper's strand does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the strand
is currently attached to a target, the roper takes a --4 penalty on its
opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a strand
deals no damage to a roper.

**Strands (Ex):** Most encounters with a roper begin when it fires
strong, sticky strands. The creature can have up to six strands at once,
and they can strike up to 50 feet away (no range increment). If a strand
is severed, the roper can extrude a new one on its next turn as a free
action.

**Weakness (Ex):** A roper's strands can sap an opponent's strength.
Anyone grabbed by a strand must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or
take 2d8 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Skills:** \*Ropers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in stony or
icy areas.

The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan
underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust monster's prehensile antennae
can rust metals on contact.

The typical rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high, weighing
200 pounds.

### Combat {#rust-monster--combat}

A rust monster can scent a metal object from up to 90 feet away. When it
detects one, it dashes toward the source and attempts to strike it with
its antennae. The creature is relentless, chasing characters over long
distances if they still possess intact metal objects but usually ceasing
its attacks to devour a freshly rusted meal.

The creature targets the largest metal object available, striking first
at armor, then at shields and smaller items. It prefers ferrous metals
(steel or iron) over precious metals (such as gold or silver) but will
devour the latter if given the opportunity.

**Rust (Ex):** A rust monster that makes a successful touch attack with
its antennae causes the target metal to corrode, falling to pieces and
becoming useless immediately. The touch can destroy up to a 10-foot cube
of metal instantly. Magic armor and weapons, and other magic items made
of metal, must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or be dissolved. The save
DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.

A metal weapon that deals damage to a rust monster corrodes immediately.
Wooden, stone, and other nonmetallic weapons are unaffected.
