Magmins are small, human-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire
that radiate intense heat and are wreathed in an aura of searing flames.
A typical magmin is 4 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.

Magmins speak Ignan.

### Combat {#magmin--combat}

Although small, magmins are dangerous opponents. Their touch is
effective against those who lack protection or immunity from heat and
flames, but if faced with opponents who have immunity to fire, magmins
rely on their slam attack. In any case, magmins are not valiant
fighters. They usually flee if injured, although often only far enough
to set up a fiery ambush for their enemies.

A magmin's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction.

**Combustion (Ex):** Anyone a magmin touches must succeed on a DC 12
Reflex save or take an extra 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes ignite
or armor becomes searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d4+2
rounds after the magmin's last successful attack. Magmins can also
ignite flammable materials with a touch. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

**Fiery Aura (Ex):** Anyone within 20 feet of a magmin must succeed on a
DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of heat damage per round from
the intense heat. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Melt Weapons (Ex):** Any metal weapon that strikes a magmin must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds.
Manticores speak Common.

### Combat {#manticore--combat}

A manticore begins most attacks with a volley of spikes, then closes. In
the outdoors, it often uses its powerful wings to stay aloft during
battle.

**Spikes (Ex):** With a snap of its tail, a manticore can loose a volley
of six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike).
This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets
must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only
twenty-four spikes in any 24-hour period.

**Skills:** \*Manticores have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A medusa is indistinguishable from a normal human at distances greater
than 30 feet (or closer, if its face is concealed). The creature often
wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood
or veil.

A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a
human.

Medusas speak Common.

### Combat {#medusa--combat}

A medusa tries to disguise its true nature until the intended victim is
within range of its petrifying gaze, using subterfuge and bluffing games
to convince the target that there is no danger. It uses normal weapons
to attack those who avert their eyes or survive its gaze, while its
poisonous snakes strike at adjacent opponents.

**Petrifying Gaze (Su):** Turn to stone permanently, 30 feet, Fortitude
DC 15 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage 1d6 Str,
secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

## Mephit

Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid
features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental
origins are apparent at first glance.

### Combat {#mephit--combat}

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the
nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction.

**Breath Weapon (Su):** A mephit can use its breath weapon once every
1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for
details.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** All mephits have one or more spell-like
abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions
for details.

***Summon Mephit* (Sp):** Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon
another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a *summon
monster* spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a
failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has
just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This
ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

**Fast Healing (Ex):** Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round,
provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See
the individual descriptions for details.

feet long. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5
feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 4,500 pounds.

Mimics speak Common.

### Combat {#mimic--combat}

A mimic often surprises an unsuspecting adventurer, lashing out with a
heavy pseudopod. The creature does not necessarily fight to the death if
it can succeed in extorting treasure or food from a party.

**Adhesive (Ex):** A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful
adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An
adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with
its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic
is alive without removing the adhesive first.

A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the
wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A successful DC 16 Strength
check is needed to pry it off.

Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple
normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance
breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.

**Crush (Ex):** A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful
grapple check.

**Mimic Shape (Ex):** A mimic can assume the general shape of any object
that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as
a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The creature cannot
substantially alter its size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a
rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who
examines the mimic can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check
opposed by the mimic's Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is
generally far too late.

**Skills:** A mimic has a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks.

A minotaur stands more than 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.

Minotaurs speak Giant.

### Combat {#minotaur--combat}

Minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great strength serves them
well.

**Powerful Charge (Ex):** A minotaur typically begins a battle by
charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty horns
into play. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge,
this allows the beast to make a single gore attack with a +9 attack
bonus that deals 4d6+6 points of damage.

**Natural Cunning (Ex):** Although minotaurs are not especially
intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives
them immunity to *maze* spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost,
and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught
flat-footed.

**Skills:** Minotaurs have a +4 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen
checks.

points equal to 9 x (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1). Its class skills are

Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains
who died without atoning for their crimes. Most mohrgs are 5 to 6 feet
tall and weigh about 120 pounds.

### Combat {#mohrg--combat}

Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their fists. They
often catch opponents flat-footed, for they move much faster than
zombies.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature
of its size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity.

**Paralyzing Touch (Su):** A mohrg lashes out with its tongue in combat.
An opponent the tongue touches must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or
become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Create Spawn (Su):** Creatures killed by a mohrg rise after 1d4 days
as zombies under the morhg's control. They do not possess any of the
abilities they had in life.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mummies are preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark
desert gods best forgotten.

Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.

Mummies can speak Common, but seldom bother to do so.

### Combat {#mummy--combat}

**Despair (Su):** At the mere sight of a mummy, the viewer must succeed
on a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether
or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by
the same mummy's despair ability for 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

**Mummy Rot (Su):** Supernatural disease---slam, Fortitude DC 16,
incubation period 1 minute; damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot continues until the victim reaches
Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described below.

Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character
attempting to cast any conjuration (healing) spell on a creature
afflicted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or
the spell has no effect on the afflicted character.

To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with *break
enchantment* or *remove curse* (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for
either spell), after which a caster level check is no longer necessary
to cast healing spells on the victim, and the mummy rot can be magically
cured as any normal disease.

An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand and
dust that blow away into nothing at the first wind.

### Mummy Lord

Unusually powerful or evil individuals preserved as mummies sometimes
rise as greater mummies after death. A mummy lord resembles its lesser
fellows, but often wears or carries equipment it used in life.

Mummy lords are often potent spellcasters. They are found as guardians
of the tombs of high lords, priests, and mages. Most are sworn to defend
for eternity the resting place of those whom they served in life, but in
some cases a mummy lord's unliving state is the result of a terrible
curse or rite designed to punish treason, infidelity, or crimes of an
even more abhorrent nature. A mummy lord of this sort is usually
imprisoned in a tomb that is never meant to be opened again.

**Despair (Su):** The save DC against this mummy lord's despair is 17.

**Mummy Rot (Su):** The save DC against this mummy lord's mummy rot is
17.

*Typical Cleric Spells Prepared* (6/7/6/5/5/4; save DC 15 + spell
level): 0---*detect magic* (2), *guidance, read magic, resistance,

\*Domain Spell. Domains: Death and Protection.

Possessions: +2 half-plate armor, cloak of resistance +2, ring of minor
elemental resistance (fire), brooch of shielding. (Different mummy lords
may have different possessions.)

## Naga

All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales,
and more or less human faces. They range in length from 10 to 20 feet
and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and
intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light.

### Combat {#naga--combat}

Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost
always found in the lairs they guard and know well, they can arrange
most encounters to suit their wishes.

Dark nagas speak Common and Infernal.

#### Combat {#dark-naga--combat}

Dark nagas prefer to fight from an elevated position where they get a
good view of the battlefield while also staying out of reach.

**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 16 or lapse into a
nightmare-haunted sleep for 2d4 minutes. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

**Spells:** Dark nagas cast spells as 7th-level sorcerers.

*Typical Sorcerer Spells Known* (6/7/7/5; save DC 13 + spell level):
0---*daze, detect magic, light, mage hand, open/close, ray of frost,
read magic;* 1st---*expeditious retreat, magic missile, ray of
enfeeblement, shield, silent image;* 2nd---*cat's grace, invisibility,
scorching ray;* 3rd---*displacement, lightning bolt.*

**Resistance to *Charm*:** Dark nagas have a +2 racial bonus on saving
throws against all *charm* effects (not included in the statistics
block).

**Detect Thoughts (Su):** A dark naga can continuously use detect
thoughts as the spell (caster level 9th; Will DC 15 negates). This
ability is always active. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Guarded Thoughts (Ex):** Dark nagas are immune to any form of mind
reading.

Guardian nagas speak Celestial and Common.

#### Combat {#guardian-naga--combat}

Guardian nagas usually warn off intruders before attacking. If the
warning is ignored, they may begin a spell assault or spit poison.

**Poison (Ex):** Injury or contact, Fortitude DC 19, initial and
secondary damage 1d10 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Spit (Ex):** A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a
standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment.
Opponents hit by this attack must make successful saves (see above) to
avoid the effect.

**Spells:** Guardian nagas cast spells as 9th-level sorcerers, and can
also cast spells from the cleric list and from the Good and Law domains.
The cleric spells and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a
guardian naga, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to
cast them.

*Typical Spells Known* (6/7/7/7/5; save DC 14 + spell level): 0--- *cure
minor wounds, daze, detect magic, light, mage hand, open/close, ray of
frost, read magic;* 1st---*cure light wounds, divine favor, expeditious
retreat, mage armor, magic missile;* 2nd---*detect thoughts, lesser
restoration, see invisibility, scorching ray;* 3rd---*cure serious

Spirit nagas speak Abyssal and Common.

#### Combat {#spirit-naga--combat}

Spirit nagas meet foes boldly so as to use their gaze attacks to best
effect. They quickly slither forward to bite foes that avert their eyes.

**Charming Gaze (Su):** As *charm person,* 30 feet, Will DC 19 negates.
The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial and secondary damage

**Spells:** Spirit nagas cast spells as 7th-level sorcerers, and can
also cast spells from the cleric spell list and from the Chaos and Evil
domains as arcane spells. The cleric spells and domain spells are
considered arcane spells for a spirit naga, meaning that the creature
does not need a divine focus to cast them.

A night hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.

Night hags speak Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal.

### Combat {#night-hag--combat}

Night hags attack good creatures on sight if the odds of success seem
favorable.

These creatures rip through armor and flesh with their deadly teeth.
They love to use *sleep* and then strangle those who are overcome by it.

A night hag's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

**Disease (Ex):** Demon fever---bite, Fortitude DC 18, incubation period
1 day, damage 1d6 Con. Each day after the first, on a failed save, an
afflicted creature must immediately succeed on another DC 18 Fortitude
save or take 1 point of Constitution drain. The save DC is Constitution
based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*detect chaos, detect evil, detect
good, detect law, detect magic, magic missile, polymorph* (self only),
*ray of enfeeblement* (DC 12)*, sleep* (DC 12). Caster level 8th. A
night hag can use *etherealness* at will (caster level 16th) so long as
it possesses its *heartstone* (see below). The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

**Dream Haunting (Su):** Night hags can visit the dreams of chaotic or
evil individuals by using a special periapt known as a *heartstone* to
become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once a hag invades
someone's dreams, it rides on the victim's back until dawn. The sleeper
suffers from tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain
upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal
intrusions, by confronting and defeating the night hag.

### Heartstone

All night hags carry a periapt known as a *heartstone,* which instantly
cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a *heartstone*
provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is
included in the statistics block). A night hag that loses this charm can
no longer use *etherealness* until it can manufacture another (which
takes one month). Creatures other than the hag can benefit from the
*heartstone*'s powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses (any
disease cured or saving throw affected

counts as a use) and it does not bestow *etherealness* to a bearer that
is not a night hag. If sold, an intact *heartstone* brings 1,800 gp.

combustible materials alight.

**Smoke (Su):** During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and
neighs with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot,
sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone
must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a --2 penalty on all
attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The
cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action
during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against
creatures 5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or
farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare's vision at all.

**Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su):** These abilities function
just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare
can use either at will.

**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a nightmare is up to 300 pounds;
a medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

### Cauchemar

The cauchemar is a horrible, especially malevolent version of a
nightmare. The sight of one of these great horrors bearing down is
enough to shake the heart of the boldest champion.

#### Combat {#cauchemar--combat}

The save DC for the cauchemar's smoke attack (DC 24) is adjusted for its
greater number of Hit Dice and higher Constitution score.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a cauchemar is up to 612 pounds; a
medium load, 613--1,224 pounds; and a heavy load, 1,225--1,840 pounds.

## Nightshade

Nightshades are powerful undead composed of equal parts darkness and
absolute evil.

Nightshades can read and understand all forms of communication; however,
they communicate with others by telepathy.

### Combat {#nightshade--combat}

Each of the three known varieties of nightshade is a terrible creature
with unique powers and abilities. Their tactics vary according to their
abilities, but they all make liberal use of *haste*.

### Nightshade Abilities

All nightshades have the following special abilities.

**Aversion to Daylight (Ex):** If exposed to natural daylight (not
merely a *daylight* spell), nightshades take a --4 penalty on all attack
rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

**Desecrating Aura (Su):** All nightshades give off a 20-footradius
emanation of utter desecration, imbuing their surroundings with negative
energy. This ability works much like a *desecrate* spell, except that
the nightshade's evil is so great that it is treated as the shrine of an
evil power. All undead within 20 feet of the nightshade (including the
creature itself ) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls,
and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The nightshade Hit Dice,
attack, and save entries given here include these profane bonuses.)
Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area take a --6 penalty.

A nightshade's desecrating aura cannot be dispelled except by a *dispel
evil* spell or similar effect. If the effect is dispelled, the
nightshade can resume it as a free action on its next turn. Its
desecrating aura is suppressed if a nightshade enters a *consecrated* or
*hallowed* area, but the nightshade's presence also suppresses the
*consecrated* or *hallowed* effect for as long as it remains in the
area.

A nightcrawler is a massive behemoth similar to a purple worm, though
utterly black in color.

A nightcrawler measures about 7 feet in diameter and is 100 feet long
from its toothy maw to the tip of its stinging tail. It weighs about
55,000 pounds.

#### Combat {#nightcrawler--combat}

A nightcrawler attacks by burrowing through the ground and emerging to
strike.

A nightcrawler's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Energy Drain (Su):** Living creatures inside a nightcrawler's gizzard
gain one negative level each round. The DC is 26 for the Fortitude save
to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

For each such negative level bestowed, the nightcrawler gains 5
temporary hit points.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a nightcrawler must hit
with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent
in the following round.

**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial and secondary damage
2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*contagion* (DC 18), *deeper
darkness, detect magic, greater dispel magic, haste, invisibility, see
invisibility, unholy blight* (DC 18); 3/day---*cone of cold* (DC 19),
*confusion* (DC 18), *hold monster* (DC 19); 1/day---*finger of death*
(DC 21), *mass hold monster* (DC 23), *plane shift* (DC 21). Caster
level 25th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Summon Undead (Su):** A nightcrawler can summon undead creatures once
per night: 9--16 shadows, 3--6 greater shadows, or 2--4 dread wraiths.
The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** A nightcrawler can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check.
Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus
12 points of acid damage per round from the nightcrawler's gizzard and
is subject to the creature's energy drain. A swallowed creature can cut
its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35
points of damage to the gizzard (AC 21). Once the creature exits,
muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its
own way out. A nightcrawler's interior can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32
Medium, 128 Small, 512 Tiny or smaller opponents.

Nightwalkers are human-shaped horrors that haunt the darkness.

A nightwalker is about 20 feet tall and weighs about 12,000 pounds.

#### Combat {#nightwalker--combat}

Nightwalkers lurk in dark areas where they can almost always surprise
the unwary.

A nightwalker's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Crush Item (Su):** A nightwalker can destroy any weapon or item of
Large size or smaller (even magic ones, but not artifacts) by picking it
up and crushing it between its hands. The nightwalker must make a
successful disarm attempt to grab an item held by an opponent. The item
is entitled to a DC 34 Fortitude save to resist destruction. The save DC
is Strength-based.

**Evil Gaze (Su):** Fear, 30 feet. A creature that meets the
nightwalker's gaze must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be paralyzed
with fear for 1d8 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that
creature cannot be affected again by the same nightshade's gaze for 24
hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*contagion* (DC 18), *deeper
darkness, detect magic, greater dispel magic, haste, see invisibility,*
and *unholy blight* (DC 18); 3/day---*confusion* (DC 18), *hold monster*
(DC 19), *invisibility;* 1/day---*cone of cold* (DC 19), *finger of
death* (DC 21), *plane shift* (DC 21). Caster level 21st. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

**Summon Undead (Su):** A nightwalker can summon undead creatures once
per night: 7--12 shadows, 2--5 greater shadows, or 1--2 dread wraiths.
The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.

**Skills:** \*When hiding in a dark area, a nightwalker gains a +8
racial bonus on Hide checks.

#### Tactics Round-by-Round

The nightwalker is an exceedingly intelligent foe that makes the best
use of all its abilities. It favors using its spell-like abilities to
divide and disable its enemies, then closing to melee with opponents it
has isolated from their allies.

*Prior to combat:* The nightwalker keeps its *see invisibility* power
active most of the time. It uses *haste* and *invisibility* to prepare
for battle.

*Round 1:* Move to within 30 feet to make use of gaze attack and strike
with *confusion* or *hold monster,* coupled with a quickened *unholy
blight.*

*Round 2:* Hit a spellcaster with *finger of death* and another
quickened *unholy blight.*

*Round 3:* Move up to engage the enemy and attempt to disarm an enemy
fighter.

*Round 4:* Crush the disarmed weapon (or use gaze attack if disarm
attempt failed).

*Round 5:* Full attack against the unarmed foe (or on a nearby
spellcaster).

Nightwings are batlike flyers that hunt on the wing.

A nightwing has a wingspan of about 40 feet and weighs about 4,000
pounds.

#### Combat {#nightwing--combat}

Nightwings prowl the night sky and dive onto their victims. They are all
but invisible, detectable only because of the stars they obscure in
their passing.

A nightwing's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Magic Drain (Su):** A nightwing can weaken magic armor, weapons, and
shields by making a successful touch attack. The targeted item must
succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or lose 1 point of its enhancement
bonus. The save DC is Charisma-based. An item that loses its entire
enhancement bonus becomes merely a masterwork item and loses any special
abilities (such as flaming) as well. Casting *dispel evil* upon the item
reverses the effect of the magic drain, provided this occurs within a
number of days after the attack equal to the caster's level and the
caster succeeds on a DC 29 caster level check.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*contagion* (DC 18), *deeper
darkness, detect magic, haste, see invisibility, unholy blight* (DC 18);
3/day---*confusion* (DC 18), *greater dispel magic, hold monster* (DC
19), *invisibility;* 1/day---*cone of cold* (DC 19), *finger of death*
(DC 21), *plane shift* (DC 21). Caster level 17th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

**Summon Undead (Su):** A nightwing can summon undead creatures once per
night: 5--12 shadows, 2--4 greater shadows, or 1 dread wraith. The
undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.

**Skills:** \*When hiding in a dark area or flying in a dark sky, a
nightwing gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks.

A nymph is about the height and weight of a female elf.

Nymphs speak Sylvan and Common.

### Combat {#nymph--combat}

**Blinding Beauty (Su):** This ability affects all humanoids within 30
feet of a nymph. Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC
17 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently as though by the *blindness*
spell. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 1/day---*dimension door.* Caster level 7th.

**Spells:** A nymph casts divine spells as a 7th-level druid.

*Typical Druid Spells Prepared* (6/5/4/3/1, save DC 13 + spell level):
0---*cure minor wounds, detect magic, flare, guidance, light,
resistance;* 1st---*calm animal, cure light wounds, entangle,
longstrider, speak with animals;* 2nd---*barkskin, heat metal, lesser
restoration, tree shape;* 3rd--- *call lightning, cure moderate wounds,
protection from energy;* 4th---*rusting grasp.*

**Stunning Glance (Su):** As a standard action, a wrathful nymph can
stun a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target creature must
succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save
DC is Charisma-based.

**Unearthly Grace (Su):** A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus
on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
(The statistics block already reflects these bonuses).

**Wild Empathy (Ex):** This power works like the druid's wild empathy
class feature, except that a nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check.

**Skills:** A nymph has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
some special action or avoid a hazard. She can always choose to take 10
on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. She can use the run
action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.
