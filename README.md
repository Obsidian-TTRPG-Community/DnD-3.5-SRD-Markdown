# Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 SRD in Markdown
Revised (v.3.5) System Reference Document in Markdown Format

Conversion in Progress

## Plan
This SRD will be made [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) Ready, utilizing markdown links as outlined in my [SRD Conversion Guidelines](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/issues/4).

What it will include:
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) Inline Inquirieswhere it makes sense, like spells.
- Basic Frontmatter Tags
- [Dice Roller](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller) support
- Fantasy Statblock Support (Maybe not at release)
