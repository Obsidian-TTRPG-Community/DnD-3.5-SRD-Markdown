# Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 SRD in Markdown
The Dungeons and Dragons Revised (v.3.5) System Reference Document in Markdown Format, ready for Obsidian.

> Original credits go to [Olimot](https://github.com/olimot/srd-v3.5) for their 3.5 SRD in HTML format. It saved us 
 much time having this resource be ready.

**Conversion Status**: In-Progress

## Plan
This SRD will be made [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) Ready, utilizing markdown links as outlined in my [SRD Conversion Guidelines](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGShare/issues/4).

What it will include:
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) Inline Inquiries where it makes sense, such as spells.
- Basic Frontmatter Tags
- [Dice Roller](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller) support
- Fantasy Statblock Support (Maybe not at release)
- Initiative Tracker Support
