#### Hallow

*   Evocation \[Good\]
*   **Level:** Clr 5, Drd 5
*   **Components:** V, S, M, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 24 hours
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Area:** 40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** See text

_Hallow_ makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects.

First, the site or structure is guarded by a _magic circle against evil_ effect.

Second, all Charisma checks made to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus, and Charisma checks to command undead take a –4 penalty. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.)

Third, any dead body interred in a _hallowed_ site cannot be turned into an undead creature.

Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the _hallowed_ site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting _hallow_ again.

Spell effects that may be tied to a _hallowed_ site include _aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues,_ and _zone of truth_. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells’ effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)

An area can receive only one _hallow_ spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. _Hallow_ counters but does not dispel _unhallow_.

_Material Component:_ Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in the _hallowed_ area.

#### Hallucinatory Terrain

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level:** Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Area:** One 30-ft. cube/level (S)
*   **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.

_Material Component:_ A stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant.

#### Halt Undead

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Targets:** Up to three undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of _hold person_ on a living creature). The effect is broken if the _halted_ creatures are attacked or take damage.

_Material Component:_ A pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic.

Harm
----

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 6, Destruction 6
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will half; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Harm_ charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, _harm_ deals half this amount, but it cannot reduce the target’s hit points to less than 1.

If used on an undead creature, _harm_ acts like _heal_.

Haste
-----

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

A _hasted_ creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

All of the _hasted_ creature’s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for increased speed.

Multiple _haste_ effects don’t stack. _Haste_ dispels and counters _slow._

_Material Component:_ A shaving of licorice root.

Heal
----

*   Conjuration (Healing)
*   **Level:** Clr 6, Drd 7, Healing 6
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

_Heal_ enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the Target: ability damage, blinded, _confused,_ dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, _feebleminded,_ insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.

_Heal_ does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore permanently drained ability score points.

If used against an undead creature, _heal_ instead acts like _harm_.

#### Heal, Mass

*   Conjuration (Healing)
*   **Level:** Clr 9, Healing 9
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _heal,_ except as noted above. The maximum number of hit points restored to each creature is 250.

#### Heal Mount

*   Conjuration (Healing)
*   **Level:** Pal 3
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Your mount touched
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

This spell functions like _heal,_ but it affects only the paladin’s special mount (typically a warhorse).

#### Heat Metal

*   Transmutation \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Drd 2, Sun 2
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** Metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lb. of metal/level, all of which must be within a 30-ft. circle
*   **Duration:** 7 rounds
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

_Heat metal_ makes metal extremely warm. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it’s carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.

On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell’s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.

Round

Metal Temperature

Damage

1

Warm

None

2

Hot

1d4 points

3–5

Searing

2d4 points

6

Hot

1d4 points

7

Warm

None

Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. If cast underwater, _heat metal_ deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.

_Heat metal_ counters and dispels _chill metal_.

#### Helping Hand

*   Evocation
*   **Level:** Clr 3
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 5 miles
*   **Effect:** Ghostly hand
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.

When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is.

Distance

Time to Locate

100 ft. or less

1 round

1,000 ft.

1 minute

1 mile

10 minutes

2 miles

1 hour

3 miles

2 hours

4 miles

3 hours

5 miles

4 hours

Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears.

The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate you.

If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.

If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.

The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can’t pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.

#### Heroes’ Feast

*   Conjuration \[Creation\]
*   **Level:** Brd 6, Clr 6
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** Feast for one creature/level
*   **Duration:** 1 hour plus 12 hours; see text
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table, chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every creature partaking of the feast is cured of all diseases, sickness, and nausea; becomes immune to poison for 12 hours; and gains 1d8 temporary hit points +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) after imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is part of the feast. The ambrosial food that is consumed grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and Will saves and immunity to fear effects for 12 hours.

If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.

#### Heroism

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

This spell imbues a single creature with great bravery and morale in battle. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks.

#### Heroism, Greater

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level

This spell functions like _heroism,_ except the creature gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum 20).

#### Hide From Animals

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Drd 1, Rgr 1
*   **Components:** S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Targets:** One creature touched/level
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Animals cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.

#### Hide From Undead

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Clr 1
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Targets:** One touched creature/level
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless); see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Undead cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead creature gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can’t see any of the warded creatures. However, if it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded creature attempts to turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients.

#### Hideous Laughter

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One creature; see text
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally.

A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster’s receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn’t “translate” well.

_Material Component:_ Tiny tarts that are thrown at the target and a feather that is waved in the air.

#### Hold Animal

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Animal 2, Drd 2, Rgr 2
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Target:** One animal

This spell functions like _hold person,_ except that it affects an animal instead of a humanoid.

#### Hold Monster

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 4, Law 6, Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Target:** One living creature

This spell functions like _hold person,_ except that it affects any living creature that fails its Will save.

_Arcane Material Component:_ One hard metal bar or rod, which can be as small as a three-penny nail.

#### Hold Monster, Mass

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Targets:** One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _hold person,_ except that it affects multiple creatures and holds any living creature that fails its Will save.

#### Hold Person

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Clr 2, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, F/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Target:** One humanoid creature
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D); see text
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.)

A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.

_Arcane Focus:_ A small, straight piece of iron.

#### Hold Person, Mass

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Targets:** One or more humanoid creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _hold person,_ except as noted above.

#### Hold Portal

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Component:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Target:** One portal, up to 20 sq. ft./level
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A _knock_ spell or a successful _dispel magic_ spell can negate a _hold portal_ spell.

For a portal affected by this spell, add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open the portal.

#### Holy Aura

*   Abjuration \[Good\]
*   **Level:** Clr 8, Good 8
*   **Components:** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 20 ft.
*   **Targets:** One creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike _protection from evil_, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.

Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as _protection from evil_ does.

Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as _blindness/deafness_, but against _holy aura’s_ save DC).

_Focus:_ A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.

#### Holy Smite

*   Evocation \[Good\]
*   **Level:** Good 4
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** 20-ft.-radius burst
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous (1 round); see text
*   **Saving Throw:** Will partial; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

#### Holy Sword

*   Evocation \[Good\]
*   **Level:** Pal 4
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Melee weapon touched
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a _+5 holy weapon_ (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a _magic circle against evil_ effect (as the spell). If the _magic circle_ ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one _holy sword_ at a time.

If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with _bless weapon_ or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.

This spell does not work on artifacts.

_Note:_ A masterwork weapon’s bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.

#### Holy Word

*   Evocation \[Good, Sonic\]
*   **Level:** Clr 7, Good 7
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 40 ft.
*   **Area:** Nongood creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Any nongood creature within the area that hears the _holy word_ suffers the following ill effects.

HD

Effect

Equal to caster level

Deafened

Up to caster level

–1 Blinded, deafened

Up to caster level

–5 Paralyzed, blinded, deafened

Up to caster level

–10 Killed, paralyzed, blinded, deafened

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. No saving throw is allowed against these effects.

_Deafened:_ The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds.

_Blinded:_ The creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds.

_Paralyzed:_ The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes.

_Killed:_ Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the _holy word._ The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a –4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by _holy word._

#### Horrid Wilting

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 8, Water 8
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Targets:** Living creatures, no two of which can be more than 60 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell evaporates moisture from the body of each subject living creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, which instead take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8).

_Arcane Material Component:_ A bit of sponge.

#### Hypnotic Pattern

*   Illusion (Pattern) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V (Brd only), S, M; see text
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** Colorful lights in a 10-ft.-radius spread
*   **Duration:** Concentration + 2 rounds
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of Hit Dice of creatures affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.

A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must sing, play music, or recite a rhyme as a verbal component.

_Material Component:_ A glowing stick of incense or a crystal rod filled with phosphorescent material.

#### Hypnotism

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 round
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Area:** Several living creatures, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** 2d4 rounds (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total Hit Dice of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be fascinated.

If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of –2.

While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request.

A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.

#### Ice Storm

*   Evocation \[Cold\]
*   **Level:** Drd 4, Sor/Wiz 4, Water 5
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)
*   **Duration:** 1 full round
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Great magical hailstones pound down for 1 full round, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area. A –4 penalty applies to each Listen check made within the _ice storm_’s effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).

_Arcane Material Component:_ A pinch of dust and a few drops of water.

#### Identify

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Magic 2, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 hour
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Targets:** One touched object
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

The spell determines all magic properties of a single magic item, including how to activate those functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if any).

_Identify_ does not function when used on an artifact.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A pearl of at least 100 gp value, crushed and stirred into wine with an owl feather; the infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting.

#### Illusory Script

*   Illusion (Phantasm) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 minute or longer; see text
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** One touched object weighing no more than 10 lb.
*   **Duration:** One day/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The _illusory script_ appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it’s unintelligible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as _illusory script._

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include “Close the book and leave,” “Forget the existence of the book,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by _dispel magic,_ the _illusory script_ and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the _true seeing_ spell with the _read magic_ or _comprehend languages_ spell.

The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.

_Material Component:_ A lead-based ink (cost of not less than 50 gp).

#### Illusory Wall

*   Illusion (Figment)
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** Image 1 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.
*   **Duration:** Permanent
*   **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear.

#### Imbue with Spell Ability

*   Evocation
*   **Level:** Clr 4, Magic 4
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched; see text
*   **Duration:** Permanent until discharged (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the ability to cast them, to another creature. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 5 and a Wisdom score of at least 9 can receive this bestowal. Only cleric spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration (healing) can be transferred. The number and level of spells that the subject can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of _imbue with spell ability_ can’t exceed this limit.

HD of Recipient

Spells Imbued

2 or lower

One 1st-level spell

3–4

One or two 1st-level spells

5 or higher

One or two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell

The transferred spell’s variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and the like) function according to your level, not the level of the recipient.

Once you cast _imbue with spell ability,_ you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued spells or is slain, or until you dismiss the _imbue with spell ability_ spell. In the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put. If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active _imbue with spell ability_ spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.

To cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic component, it must have humanlike hands. To cast a spell with a material component or focus, it must have the materials or focus.

#### Implosion

*   Evocation
*   **Level:** Clr 9, Destruction 9
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** One corporeal creature/round
*   **Duration:** Concentration (up to 4 rounds)
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You create a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature’s body. For each round you concentrate, you cause one creature to collapse in on itself, killing it. (This effect, being instantaneous, cannot be dispelled.)

You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell.

_Implosion_ has no effect on creatures in gaseous form or on incorporeal creatures.

#### Imprisonment

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

When you cast _imprisonment_ and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the _temporal stasis_ spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a _freedom_ spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a _crystal ball,_ a _locate object_ spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but _discern location_ does. A _wish_ or _miracle_ spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target’s name and some facts about its life, the target takes a –4 penalty on its save.

#### Incendiary Cloud

*   Conjuration (Creation) \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Fire 8, Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

An _incendiary cloud_ spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a _fog cloud_ does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 4d6 points of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each round to take half damage.

As with a _cloudkill_ spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke’s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud (actually its point of origin) move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder’s spread thereafter.

As with _fog cloud_, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can’t be cast underwater.

#### Inflict Critical Wounds

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 4, Destruction 4

This spell functions like _inflict light wounds_, except that you deal 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

#### Inflict Critical Wounds, Mass

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 8

This spell functions like _mass inflict light wounds_, except that it deals 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +40).

#### Inflict Light Wounds

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 1, Destruction 1
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.

#### Inflict Light Wounds, Mass

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 5, Destruction 5
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Negative energy spreads out in all directions from the point of origin, dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +25) to nearby living enemies.

Like other _inflict_ spells, _mass inflict light wounds_ cures undead in its area rather than damaging them. A cleric capable of spontaneously casting _inflict_ spells can also spontaneously cast _mass inflict_ spells.

#### Inflict Minor Wounds

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 0
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates

This spell functions like _inflict light wounds,_ except that you deal 1 point of damage and a Will save negates the damage instead of halving it.

#### Inflict Moderate Wounds

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 2

This spell functions like _inflict light wounds_, except that you deal 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).

#### Inflict Moderate Wounds, Mass

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 6

This spell functions like _mass inflict light wounds_, except that it deals 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +30).

#### Inflict Serious Wounds

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 3

This spell functions like _inflict light wounds_, except that you deal 3d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15).

#### Inflict Serious Wounds, Mass

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 7

This spell functions like _mass inflict light wounds_, except that it deals 3d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +35).

#### Insanity

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Target:** One living creature
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The affected creature suffers from a continuous _confusion_ effect, as the spell.

_Remove curse_ does not remove _insanity_. _Greater restoration_, _heal_, _limited wish_, _miracle_, or _wish_ can restore the creature.

#### Insect Plague

*   Conjuration (Summoning)
*   **Level:** Clr 5, Drd 5
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 round
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** One swarm of locusts per three levels, each of which must be adjacent to at least one other swarm
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You summon a number of swarms of locusts (one per three levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level). The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). You may summon the locust swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won’t pursue creatures that flee.

#### Instant Summons

*   Conjuration (Summoning)
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** See text
*   **Target:** One object weighing 10 lb. or less whose longest dimension is 6 ft. or less
*   **Duration:** Permanent until discharged
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You call some nonliving item from virtually any location directly to your hand.

First, you must place your _arcane mark_ on the item. Then you cast this spell, which magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.

If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but you know who the possessor is and roughly where that creature is located when the summons occurs.

The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a _read magic_ spell, to anyone but you.

The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it.

_Material Component:_ A sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp.

#### Interposing Hand

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components:** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** 10-ft. hand
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Interposing hand_ creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand—it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.

An _interposing hand_ is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you’re undamaged, and its AC is 20 (–1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don’t cause damage do not affect it.

The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a _wall of force_ or enter an _antimagic field_, but it suffers the full effect of a _prismatic wall_ or _prismatic sphere._ The hand makes saving throws as its caster.

_Disintegrate_ or a successful _dispel magic_ destroys it.

Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature’s attacks.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

_Focus:_ A soft glove.

#### Invisibility

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2, Trickery 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal or touch
*   **Target:** You or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lb./level
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless) or Yes (harmless, object)

The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

Of course, the subject is not magically _silenced,_ and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as _bless_ that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

_Invisibility_ can be made permanent (on objects only) with a _permanency_ spell.

_Arcane Material Component:_ An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

#### Invisibility, Greater

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level:** Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Target:** You or creature touched
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

This spell functions like _invisibility_, except that it doesn’t end if the subject attacks.

#### Invisibility, Mass

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Targets:** Any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 180 ft. apart

This spell functions like _invisibility,_ except that the effect is mobile with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the group cannot see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. (If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.)

_Material Component:_ An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

#### Invisibility Purge

*   Evocation
*   **Level:** Clr 3
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5 feet per caster level that negates all forms of invisibility.

Anything invisible becomes visible while in the area.

#### Invisibility Sphere

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Area:** 10-ft.-radius emanation around the creature or object touched

This spell functions like _invisibility,_ except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the _invisibility sphere_ ends.

#### Iron Body

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Earth 8, Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities.

You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a –6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50% and a –8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can’t use potions) or play wind instruments.

Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.

Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean—at least until the spell duration expires.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A small piece of iron that was once part of either an iron golem, a hero’s armor, or a war machine.

#### Ironwood

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 minute/lb. created
*   **Range:** 0 ft.
*   **Effect:** An _ironwood_ object weighing up to 5 lb./level
*   **Duration:** One day/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

_Ironwood_ is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, _ironwood_ is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on _ironwood_. Spells that affect wood do affect _ironwood_, although _ironwood_ does not burn. Using this spell with _wood shape_ or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.

Further, if you make only half as much _ironwood_ as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.

_Material Component:_ Wood shaped into the form of the intended _ironwood_ object.

#### Irresistible Dance

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Living creature touched
*   **Duration:** 1d4+1 rounds
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a –4 penalty to Armor Class and a –10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn.

Jump
----

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 1, Rgr 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The subject gets a +10 enhancement bonus on Jump checks. The enhancement bonus increases to +20 at caster level 5th, and to +30 (the maximum) at caster level 9th.

_Material Component:_ A grasshopper’s hind leg, which you break when the spell is cast.

#### Keen Edge

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** One weapon or fifty projectiles, all of which must be in contact with each other at the time of casting
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless, object)

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19–20, a threat range of 19–20 becomes 17–20, and a threat range of 18–20 becomes 15–20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the _keen edge_ on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. (Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.)

Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as the _keen edge_ spell and the Improved Critical feat) don’t stack. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Target:** One door, box, or chest with an area of up to 10 sq. ft./level
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous; see text
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

The _knock_ spell opens stuck, barred, locked, _held,_ or _arcane locked_ doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a _arcane locked_ door, the spell does not remove the _arcane lock_ but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. _Knock_ does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.

#### Know Direction

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Brd 0, Drd 0
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous

You instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which “north” exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don’t find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction.

#### Legend Lore

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Brd 4, Knowledge 7, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M, F
*   **Casting Time:** See text
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** See text

_Legend lore_ brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4x10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better _legend lore_ result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better _legend lore_ result next time).

During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are “legendary,” as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

_Material Component:_ Incense worth at least 250 gp.

_Focus:_ Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle.

#### Lesser (Spell Name)

*   Any spell whose name begins with _lesser_ is alphabetized in this chapter according to the second word of the spell name. Thus, the description of a _lesser_ spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains that have _lesser_ spells in them include those based on the spells _confusion, geas, globe of invulnerability, planar ally, planar binding,_ and _restoration._

#### Levitate

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** You or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lb./level)
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

_Levitate_ allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be _levitated,_ and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).

A _levitating_ creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 penalty on attack rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.

_Focus:_ Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end.

Light
-----

*   Evocation \[Light\]
*   **Level:** Brd 0, Clr 0, Drd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
*   **Components:** V, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Object touched
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell causes an object to glow like a torch, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for an additional 20 feet) from the point you touch. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical _darkness_ does not function.

A light spell (one with the light descriptor) counters and dispels a darkness spell (one with the darkness descriptor) of an equal or lower level.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.

#### Lightning Bolt

*   Evocation \[Electricity\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 120 ft.
*   **Area:** 120-ft. line
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.

The _lightning bolt_ sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

_Material Component:_ A bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass rod.

#### Limited Wish

*   Universal
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V, S, XP
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** See text
*   **Target, Effect, or Area:** See text
*   **Duration:** See text
*   **Saving Throw:** None; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A _limited wish_ lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a _limited wish_ can do any of the following things.

*   Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
*   Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
*   Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it’s of a prohibited school.
*   Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, even if it’s of a prohibited school.
*   Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as _geas/quest_ or _insanity_.
*   Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a –7 penalty on its next saving throw.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell). When a _limited wish_ duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more. When a _limited wish_ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component.

_XP Cost:_ 300 XP or more (see above).

#### Liveoak

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 6
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Tree touched
*   **Duration:** One day/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while _liveoak_ is in effect, you can’t cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect.

_Liveoak_ must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The _liveoak_ spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.

If _liveoak_ is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.

#### Locate Creature

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level

This spell functions like _locate object,_ except this spell locates a known or familiar creature.

You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.

The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.

Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by _mislead_, _nondetection_, and _polymorph_ spells.

_Material Component:_ A bit of fur from a bloodhound.

#### Locate Object

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 2, Travel 2
*   **Components:** V, S, F/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Circle, centered on you, with a radius of 400 ft. + 40 ft./level
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination).

The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. _Polymorph any object_ fools it.

_Arcane Focus:_ A forked twig.

#### Longstrider

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 1, Rgr 1, Travel 1
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)

This spell increases your base land speed by 10 feet. (This adjustment counts as an enhancement bonus.) It has no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim.

_Material Component:_ A pinch of dirt.

#### Lullaby

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 0
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius burst
*   **Duration:** Concentration + 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Any creature within the area that fails a Will save becomes drowsy and inattentive, taking a –5 penalty on Listen and Spot checks and a –2 penalty on Will saves against _sleep_ effects while the _lullaby_ is in effect. _Lullaby_ lasts for as long as the caster concentrates, plus up to 1 round per caster level thereafter.
