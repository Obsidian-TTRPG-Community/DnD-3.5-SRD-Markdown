#### Passwall

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Effect::** 5 ft. by 8 ft. opening, 10 ft. deep plus 5 ft. deep per three additional levels
- **Duration::** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single _passwall_ simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several _passwall_ spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When _passwall_ ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the _passwall_ or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.

_Material Component:_ A pinch of sesame seeds.

#### Pass Without Trace

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Drd 1, Rgr 1
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Targets::** One creature/level touched
- **Duration::** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

The subject or subjects can move through any type of terrain and leave neither footprints nor scent. Tracking the subjects is impossible by nonmagical means.

#### Permanency

- Universal
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
- **Components::** V, S, XP
- **Casting Time::** 2 rounds
- **Range::** See text
- **Target, Effect, or Area::** See text
- **Duration::** Permanent; see text
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

This spell makes certain other spells permanent.

Depending on the spell, you must be of a minimum caster level and must expend a number of XP.

You can make the following spells permanent in regard to yourself.

You cast the desired spell and then follow it with the _permanency_ spell. You cannot cast these spells on other creatures. This application of _permanency_ can be dispelled only by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.

In addition to personal use, _permanency_ can be used to make the following spells permanent on yourself, another creature, or an object (as appropriate).

| Spell                                                 | Minimum Caster Level | XP Cost  |

Spells cast on other creatures, objects, or locations (not on you) are vulnerable to _dispel magic_ as normal.

_XP Cost:_ See tables above.

#### Permanent Image

- Illusion (Figment)
- **Level::** Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
- **Effect::** Figment that cannot extend beyond a 20-ft. cube + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)
- **Duration::** Permanent (D)

This spell functions like _silent image,_ except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, and the spell is permanent. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating.

_Material Component:_ A bit of fleece plus powdered jade worth 100 gp.

#### Persistent Image

- Illusion (Figment)
- **Level::** Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5
- **Duration::** 1 min./level (D)

This spell functions like _silent image,_ except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and the figment follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish.

_Material Component:_ A bit of fleece and several grains of sand.

#### Phantasmal Killer

- Illusion (Phantasm) \[Fear, Mind-Affecting\]
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 4
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Target::** One living creature
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Will disbelief (if interacted with), then Fortitude partial; see text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject’s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell’s subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.

If the subject of a _phantasmal killer_ attack succeeds in disbelieving and is wearing a _helm of telepathy,_ the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.

#### Phantom Steed

- Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level::** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
- **Range::** 0 ft.
- **Effect::** One quasi-real, horselike creature
- **Duration::** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature. The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

The mount has an AC of 18 (–1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its rider’s weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount’s abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

_8th Level:_ The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

_10th Level:_ The mount can use _water walk_ at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).

_12th Level:_ The mount can use _air walk_ at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.

_14th Level:_ The mount can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).

#### Phantom Trap

- Illusion (Glamer)
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 2
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Object touched
- **Duration::** Permanent (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100% certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is “sprung”; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.

If another _phantom trap_ is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.

_Material Component:_ A piece of iron pyrite touched to the object to be trapped while the object is sprinkled with a special dust requiring 50 gp to prepare.

#### Phase Door

- Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 7, Travel 8
- **Components::** V
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 0 ft.
- **Effect::** Ethereal 5 ft. by 8 ft. opening, 10 ft. deep + 5 ft. deep per three levels
- **Duration::** One usage per two levels
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The _phase door_ is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the _phase door_ and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A _gem of true seeing_ or similar magic reveals the presence of a _phase door_ but does not allow its use.

A _phase door_ is subject to _dispel magic._ If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a _passwall_ effect.

You can allow other creatures to use the _phase door_ by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.

_Phase door_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

#### Planar Ally

- Conjuration (Calling) \[see text for _lesser planar ally_\]
- **Level::** Clr 6
- **Effect::** One or two called elementals or outsiders, totaling no more than 12 HD, which cannot be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear

This spell functions like _lesser planar ally_, except you may call a single creature of 12 HD or less, or two creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 12. The creatures agree to help you and request your return payment together.

_XP Cost:_ 250 XP.

#### Planar Ally, Greater

- Conjuration (Calling) \[see text for _lesser planar ally_\]
- **Level::** Clr 8
- **Effect::** Up to three called elementals or outsiders, totaling no more than 18 HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear.

This spell functions like _lesser planar ally_, except that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. The creatures agree to help you and request your return payment together.

_XP Cost:_ 500 XP.

#### Planar Ally, Lesser

- Conjuration (Calling) \[see text\]
- **Level::** Clr 4
- **Components::** V, S, DF, XP
- **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect::** One called elemental or outsider of 6 HD or less
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity’s choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature’s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).

You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.

The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature’s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.

A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.

A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature’s ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.

At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).

_Note:_ When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

_XP Cost:_ 100 XP.

#### Planar Binding

- Conjuration (Calling) \[see text for _lesser planar binding_\]
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 6
- **Components::** V, S
- **Targets::** Up to three elementals or outsiders, totaling no more than 12 HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear

This spell functions like _lesser planar binding,_ except that you may call a single creature of 12 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 12. Each creature gets a save, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.

#### Planar Binding, Greater

- Conjuration (Calling) \[see text for _lesser planar binding_\]
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 8
- **Components::** V, S
- **Targets::** Up to three elementals or outsiders, totaling no more than 18 HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear.

This spell functions like _lesser planar binding,_ except that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes independent attempts to escape, and must be persuaded to aid you individually.

#### Planar Binding, Lesser

- Conjuration (Calling) \[see text\]
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text
- **Target::** One elemental or outsider with 6 HD or less
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance::** No and Yes; see text

Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell’s range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.

To create the trap, you must use a _magic circle_ spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual’s proper name in casting the spell.

The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A _dimensional anchor_ cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see _magic circle against evil_) to make the trap more secure.

If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature’s Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.

Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

#### Plane Shift

- Conjuration (Teleportation)
- **Level::** Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 7
- **Components::** V, S, F
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the _plane shift_ at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination.

_Note: Plane shift_ transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.

_Focus:_ A small, forked metal rod. The size and metal type dictates to which plane of existence or alternate dimension the spell sends the affected creatures.

#### Plant Growth

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Drd 3, Plant 3, Rgr 3
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** See text
- **Target or Area::** See text
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

_Plant growth_ has different effects depending on the version chosen.

_Overgrowth:_ This effect causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level) to become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures. The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect.

At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter circle.

You may designate places within the area that are not affected.

_Enrichment:_ This effect targets plants within a range of one-half mile, raising their potential productivity over the course of the next year to one-third above normal.

_Plant growth_ counters _diminish plants_.

This spell has no effect on plant creatures.

#### Poison

- Necromancy
- **Level::** Clr 4, Drd 3
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Living creature touched
- **Duration::** Instantaneous; see text
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

Calling upon the venomous powers of natural predators, you infect the subject with a horrible poison by making a successful melee touch attack. The poison deals 1d10 points of temporary Constitution damage immediately and another 1d10 points of temporary Constitution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Wis modifier).

#### Polar Ray

- Evocation \[Cold\]
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 8
- **Components::** V, S, F
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect::** Ray
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

A blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d6).

_Focus:_ A small, white ceramic cone or prism.

#### Polymorph

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 4
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Willing living creature touched
- **Duration::** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

This spell functions like _alter self,_ except that you change the willing subject into another form of living creature. The new form may be of the same type as the subject or any of the following types: aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin. The assumed form can’t have more Hit Dice than your caster level (or the subject’s HD, whichever is lower), to a maximum of 15 HD at 15th level. You can’t cause a subject to assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you cause a subject to assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. The subject’s creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form.

Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal the subject further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains dead.

The subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form or any supernatural or spell-like abilities.

Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being _polymorphed_, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.

_Material Component:_ An empty cocoon.

#### Polymorph Any Object

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 8, Trickery 8
- **Components::** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target::** One creature, or one nonmagical object of up to 100 cu. ft./level
- **Duration::** See text
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude negates (object); see text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (object)

This spell functions like _polymorph,_ except that it changes one object or creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The duration is determined by using the following guidelines.

Changed Subject Is:

Unlike _polymorph, polymorph any object_ does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form. If the original form didn’t have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.

Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force.

A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren’t affected by this spell.

This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.

This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of _baleful polymorph, polymorph, flesh to stone_, _stone to flesh_, _transmute mud to rock_, _transmute metal to wood,_ or _transmute rock to mud._

_Arcane Material Component:_ Mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.

- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 40 ft.
- **Area::** All allies and foes within a 40-ft.-radius burst centered on you
- **Duration::** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You bring special favor upon yourself and your allies while bringing disfavor to your enemies. You and your each of your allies gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks, while each of your foes takes a –1 penalty on such rolls.

#### Prestidigitation

- Universal
- **Level::** Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 10 ft.
- **Target, Effect, or Area::** See text
- **Duration::** 1 hour
- **Saving Throw::** See text
- **Spell Resistance::** No

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a _prestidigitation_ spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. _Prestidigitation_ can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a _prestidigitation_ spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a _prestidigitation_ lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

#### Prismatic Sphere

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Protection 9, Sor/Wiz 9, Sun 9
- **Components::** V
- **Range::** 10 ft.
- **Effect::** 10-ft.-radius sphere centered on you

This spell functions like _prismatic wall,_ except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum.

The sphere’s _blindness_ effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4x10 minutes.

You can pass into and out of the _prismatic sphere_ and remain near it without harm. However, when you’re inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.

Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on.

The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a _prismatic wall._

_Prismatic sphere_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

#### Prismatic Spray

- Evocation
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 7
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 60 ft.
- **Area::** Cone-shaped burst
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** See text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

This spell causes seven shimmering, intertwined, multicolored beams of light to spray from your hand. Each beam has a different power. Creatures in the area of the spell with 8 HD or less are automatically blinded for 2d4 rounds. Every creature in the area is randomly struck by one or more beams, which have additional effects.

#### Prismatic Wall

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 8
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect::**Wall 4 ft./level wide, 2 ft./level high
- **Duration::** 10 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** See text
- **Spell Resistance::** See text

_Prismatic wall_ creates a vertical, opaque wall—a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall.

The wall’s maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A _prismatic wall_ spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.

Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.

The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A _rod of cancellation_ or a_mage’s disjunction_ spell destroys a _prismatic wall_, but an _antimagic field_ fails to penetrate it. _Dispel magic_ and _greater dispel magic_ cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a _prismatic wall_, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.

_Prismatic wall_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

#### Produce Flame

- Evocation \[Fire\]
- **Level::** Drd 1, Fire 2
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 0 ft.
- **Effect::** Flame in your palm
- **Duration::** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.

This spell does not function underwater.

#### Programmed Image

- Illusion (Figment)
- **Level::** Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
- **Effect::** Visual figment that cannot extend beyond a 20-ft. cube + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)
- **Duration::** Permanent until triggered, then 1 round/level

This spell functions like _silent image,_ except that this spell’s figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.

You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. (See _magic mouth_ for more details about such triggers.)

_Material Component:_ A bit of fleece and jade dust worth 25 gp.

#### Project Image

- Illusion (Shadow)
- **Level::** Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 7
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect::** One shadow duplicate
- **Duration::** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance::** No

You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action).

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.

If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The projected image can’t cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image.

Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had succeeded on their Will save.

You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use _dimension door, teleport, plane shift,_ or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

_Material Component:_ A small replica of you (a doll), which costs 5 gp to create.

#### Protection From Arrows

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 2
- **Components::** V, S, F
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature touched
- **Duration::** 1 hour/level or until discharged
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

The warded creature gains resistance to ranged weapons. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons. (This spell doesn’t grant you the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.

_Focus:_ A piece of shell from a tortoise or a turtle.

#### Protection From Chaos

- Abjuration \[Lawful\]
- **Level::** Clr 1, Law 1, Pal 1, Sor/Wiz 1

This spell functions like _protection from evil_, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks from chaotic creatures, and chaotic summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.

#### Protection From Energy

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Clr 3, Drd 3, Luck 3, Protection 3, Rgr 2, Sor/Wiz 3
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature touched
- **Duration::** 10 min./level or until discharged
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

_Protection from energy_ grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.

_Note: Protection from energy_ overlaps (and does not stack with) _resist energy._ If a character is warded by _protection from energy_ and _resist energy,_ the _protection_ spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.

#### Protection From Evil

- Abjuration \[Good\]
- **Level::** Clr 1, Good 1, Pal 1, Sor/Wiz 1
- **Components::** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature touched
- **Duration::** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** No; see text

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a _magic jar_ attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as _dominate person_). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the _protection from evil_ effect. If the _protection from evil_ effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

#### Protection From Good

- Abjuration \[Evil\]
- **Level::** Clr 1, Evil 1, Sor/Wiz 1

This spell functions like _protection from evil_, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks from good creatures, and good summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.

#### Protection From Law

- Abjuration \[Chaotic\]
- **Level::** Chaos 1, Clr 1, Sor/Wiz 1

This spell functions like _protection from evil_, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks from lawful creatures, and lawful summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.

#### Protection From Spells

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Magic 8, Sor/Wiz 8
- **Components::** V, S, M, F
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Targets::** Up to one creature touched per four levels
- **Duration::** 10 min./level
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

The subject gains a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities (but not against supernatural and extraordinary abilities).

_Material Component:_ A diamond of at least 500 gp value, which must be crushed and sprinkled over the targets.

_Focus:_ One 1,000 gp diamond per creature to be granted the protection. Each subject must carry one such gem for the duration of the spell. If a subject loses the gem, the spell ceases to affect him.

#### Prying Eyes

- Divination
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 minute
- **Range::** One mile
- **Effect::** Ten or more levitating eyes
- **Duration::** 1 hour/level; see text (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called “eyes”) equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.

While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.

When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.

In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.

If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won’t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.

The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. _Dispel magic_ can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

_Material Component:_ A handful of crystal marbles.

#### Prying Eyes, Greater

- Divination
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 8

This spell functions like _prying eyes,_ except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had _true seeing_ with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at full normal speed. Also, a _greater prying eye_’s maximum Spot modifier is +25 instead of +15.

#### Purify Food and Drink

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Clr 0, Drd 0
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 10 ft.
- **Target::** 1 cu. ft./level of contaminated food and water
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (object)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (object)

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by _purify food and drink,_ but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.

_Note:_ Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

#### Pyrotechnics

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
- **Target::** One fire source, up to a 20-ft. cube
- **Duration::** 1d4+1 rounds, or 1d4+1 rounds after creatures leave the smoke cloud; see text
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates or Fortitude negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes or No; see text

_Pyrotechnics_ turns a fire into either a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on the version you choose.

_Fireworks:_ The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness.

_Smoke Cloud:_ A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud. The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.

_Material Component:_ The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.

#### Quench

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Drd 3
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Area or Target::** One 20-ft. cube/level (S) or one fire-based magic item
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** None or Will negates (object)
- **Spell Resistance::** No or Yes (object)

_Quench_ is often used to put out forest fires and other conflagrations. It extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. The spell also dispels any fire spells in its area, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.

Each elemental (fire) creature within the area of a _quench_ spell takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6, no save allowed).

Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame. The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless it succeeds on a Will save. (Artifacts are immune to this effect.)

Rage
----

- Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
- **Level::** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 3
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Targets::** One willing living creature per three levels, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Duration::** Concentration + 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical with a barbarian’s rage except that the subjects aren’t fatigued at the end of the rage.

#### Rainbow Pattern

- Illusion (Pattern) \[Mind-Affecting\]
- **Level::** Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 4
- **Components::** V (Brd only), S, M, F; see text
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect::** Colorful lights with a 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration::** Concentration +1 round/ level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within it. _Rainbow pattern_ fascinates a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern.

With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area each fascinated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked creatures who can’t see them are no longer affected.

The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

_Verbal Component:_ A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must sing, play music, or recite a rhyme as a verbal component.

_Material Component:_ A piece of phosphor.

_Focus:_ A crystal prism.

#### Raise Dead

- Conjuration (Healing)
- **Level::** Clr 5
- **Components::** V, S, M, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 minute
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Dead creature touched
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** None; see text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.

A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

_Material Component:_ Diamonds worth a total of least 5,000 gp.

#### Ray of Enfeeblement

- Necromancy
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 1
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect::** Ray
- **Duration::** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject’s Strength score cannot drop below 1.

#### Ray of Exhaustion

- Necromancy
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 3
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect::** Ray
- **Duration::** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude partial; see text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell’s duration. A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only fatigued.

A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell’s duration expires.

_Material Component:_ A drop of sweat.

#### Ray of Frost

- Evocation \[Cold\]
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 0
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect::** Ray
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

A ray of freezing air and ice projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d3 points of cold damage.

#### Read Magic

- Divination
- **Level::** Brd 0, Clr 0, Drd 0, Pal 1, Rgr 1, Sor/Wiz 0
- **Components::** V, S, F
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Personal
- **Target::** You
- **Duration::** 10 min./level

By means of _read magic,_ you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the like—that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of _read magic._ You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a _glyph of warding_ with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a _greater glyph of warding_ with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any _symbol_ spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

_Read magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

_Focus:_ A clear crystal or mineral prism.

#### Reduce Animal

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Drd 2, Rgr 3
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** One willing animal of Small, Medium, Large, or Huge size
- **Duration::** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

This spell functions like _reduce person,_ except that it affects a single willing animal. Reduce the damage dealt by the animal’s natural attacks as appropriate for its new size.

#### Reduce Person

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 1
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 round
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target::** One humanoid creature
- **Duration::** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude negates
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature’s size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a –2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size.

A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent’s square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn’t change the target’s speed.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.

Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any _reduced_ item that leaves the _reduced_ creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).

Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack.

_Reduce person_ counters and dispels _enlarge person_.

_Reduce person_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

_Material Component:_ A pinch of powdered iron.

#### Reduce Person, Mass

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 4
- **Target::** One humanoid creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _reduce person_, except that it affects multiple creatures.

#### Refuge

- Conjuration (Teleportation)
- **Level::** Clr 7, Sor/Wiz 9
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Object touched
- **Duration::** Permanent until discharged
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

You create powerful magic in some specially prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is transmuted, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character’s heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar that is touching the subject).

You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the _refuge_ spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.

_Material Component:_ The specially prepared object, whose construction requires gems worth 1,500 gp.

#### Regenerate

- Conjuration (Healing)
- **Level::** Clr 7, Drd 9, Healing 7
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 3 full rounds
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Living creature touched
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

The subject’s severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.

_Regenerate_ also cures 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and/or fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including undead).

#### Reincarnate

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Drd 4
- **Components::** V, S, M, DF
- **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Dead creature touched
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** None; see text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.

Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.

A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject’s racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can’t be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.

It’s possible for the change in the subject’s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.

For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.

A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.

A _wish_ or a _miracle_ spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.

_Material Component:_ Rare oils and unguents worth a total of least 1,000 gp, spread over the remains.

- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature touched
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

_Remove blindness/deafness_ cures blindness or deafness (your choice), whether the effect is normal or magical in nature. The spell does not restore ears or eyes that have been lost, but it repairs them if they are damaged.

_Remove blindness/deafness_ counters and dispels _blindness/deafness_.

#### Remove Curse

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Brd 3, Clr 3, Pal 3, Sor/Wiz 4

- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature or item touched
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

_Remove curse_ instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. _Remove curse_ does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.

_Remove curse_ counters and dispels _bestow curse_.

#### Remove Disease

- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature touched
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

_Remove disease_ cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from. The spell also kills parasites, including green slime and others. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.

_Note:_ Since the spell’s duration is instantaneous, it does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease at a later date.

#### Remove Fear

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Brd 1, Clr 1
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

You instill courage in the subject, granting it a +4 morale bonus against _fear_ effects for 10 minutes. If the subject is under the influence of a _fear_ effect when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the spell.

_Remove fear_ counters and dispels _cause fear_.

#### Remove Paralysis

- Conjuration (Healing)
- **Level::** Clr 2, Pal 2
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Targets::** Up to four creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Duration::** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

You can free one or more creatures from the effects of any temporary paralysis or related magic, including a ghoul’s touch or a _slow_ spell. If the spell is cast on one creature, the paralysis is negated. If cast on two creatures, each receives another save with a +4 resistance bonus against the effect that afflicts it. If cast on three or four creatures, each receives another save with a +2 resistance bonus.

The spell does not restore ability scores reduced by penalties, damage, or drain.

#### Repel Metal or Stone

- Abjuration \[Earth\]
- **Level::** Drd 8
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 60 ft.
- **Area::** 60-ft. line from you
- **Duration::** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

Like _repel wood,_ this spell creates waves of invisible and intangible energy that roll forth from you. All metal or stone objects in the path of the spell are pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Fixed metal or stone objects larger than 3 inches in diameter and loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. Anything else, including animated objects, small boulders, and creatures in metal armor, moves back. Fixed objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller bend or break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round.

Objects such as metal armor, swords, and the like are pushed back, dragging their bearers with them. Even magic items with metal components are repelled, although an _antimagic field_ blocks the effects.

The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell’s duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell’s power.

#### Repel Vermin

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Brd 4, Clr 4, Drd 4, Rgr 3
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 10 ft.
- **Area::** 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you
- **Duration::** 10 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None or Will negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

An invisible barrier holds back vermin. A vermin with Hit Dice of less than one-third your level cannot penetrate the barrier.

A vermin with Hit Dice of one-third your level or more can penetrate the barrier if it succeeds on a Will save. Even so, crossing the barrier deals the vermin 2d6 points of damage, and pressing against the barrier causes pain, which deters most vermin.

#### Repel Wood

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Drd 6, Plant 6
- **Components::** V, S
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** 60 ft.
- **Area::** 60-ft. line-shaped emanation from you
- **Duration::** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

Waves of energy roll forth from you, moving in the direction that you determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects are. Objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round.

Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them along. (A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action and drop it as a free action.) If a spear is planted (set) to prevent this forced movement, it splinters. Even magic items with wooden sections are repelled, although an _antimagic field_ blocks the effects.

The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell’s duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell’s power.

#### Repulsion

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Clr 7, Protection 7, Sor/Wiz 6
- **Components::** V, S, F/DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Up to 10 ft./level
- **Area::** Up to 10-ft.-radius/level emanation centered on you
- **Duration::** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting (to the limit your level allows). Any creature within or entering the field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures’ actions are not otherwise restricted.

They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. (The creature is not forced back.) The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell’s area.

_Arcane Focus:_ A pair of small iron bars attached to two small canine statuettes, one black and one white, the whole array worth 50 gp.

#### Resilient Sphere

- Evocation \[Force\]
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 4
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect::** 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around a creature
- **Duration::** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** Reflex negates
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes

A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell’s duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a _rod of cancellation_, a rod _of negation_, a _disintegrate_ spell, or a targeted _dispel magic_ spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally.

The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

_Material Component:_ A hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic.

#### Resistance

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Brd 0, Clr 0, Drd 0, Pal 1, Sor/Wiz 0
- **Components::** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature touched
- **Duration::** 1 minute
- **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

You imbue the subject with magical energy that protects it from harm, granting it a +1 resistance bonus on saves.

_Resistance_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A miniature cloak.

#### Resist Energy

- Abjuration
- **Level::** Clr 2, Drd 2, Fire 3, Pal 2, Rgr 1, Sor/Wiz 2
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** Creature touched
- **Duration::** 10 min./level
- **Saving Throw::** Fortitude negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature’s hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient’s equipment as well.

_Resist energy_ absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.

_Note: Resist energy_ overlaps (and does not stack with) _protection from energy._ If a character is warded by _protection from energy_ and _resist energy,_ the _protection_ spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.

#### Restoration

- Conjuration (Healing)
- **Level::** Clr 4, Pal 4
- **Components::** V, S, M

This spell functions like _lesser restoration,_ except that it also dispels negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. A character who has a level restored by_restoration has_ exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him or her to his or her previous level.

_Restoration_ cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.

_Restoration_ does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

_Material Component:_ Diamond dust worth 100 gp that is sprinkled over the target.

#### Restoration, Greater

- Conjuration (Healing)
- **Level::** Clr 7
- **Components::** V, S, XP
- **Casting Time::** 10 minutes

This spell functions like _lesser restoration,_ except that it dispels all negative levels afflicting the healed creature. This effect also reverses level drains by a force or creature, restoring the creature to the highest level it had previously attained. The drained levels are restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is no more than one week per caster level.

_Greater restoration_ also dispels all magical effects penalizing the creature’s abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity, _confusion,_ and similar mental effects. _Greater restoration_ does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

_XP Cost:_ 500 XP.

#### Restoration, Lesser

- Conjuration (Healing)
- **Level::** Clr 2, Drd 2, Pal 1
- **Components::** V, S

_Lesser restoration_ dispels any magical effects reducing one of the subject’s ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject’s ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the character, and improves an exhausted condition to fatigued. It does not restore permanent ability drain.

#### Resurrection

- Conjuration (Healing)
- **Level::** Clr 7
- **Casting Time::** 10 minutes

This spell functions like _raise dead,_ except that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature.

The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a _disintegrate_ spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level.

Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the subject loses one level, or 2 points of Constitution if the subject was 1st level. (If this reduction would bring its Con to 0 or lower, it can’t be resurrected). This level loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.

You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be resurrected.

_Material Component:_ A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth a total of at least 10,000 gp.

#### Reverse Gravity

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Drd 8, Sor/Wiz 7
- **Components::** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Area::** Up to one 10-ft. cube per two levels (S)
- **Duration::** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None; see text
- **Spell Resistance::** No

This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing all unattached objects and creatures within that area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.

Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself when the spell strikes. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A lodestone and iron filings.

#### Righteous Might

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Clr 5, Strength 5
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Personal
- **Target::** You
- **Duration::** 1 round/level (D)

Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one, and you gain a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. You gain damage reduction 5/evil (if you normally channel positive energy) or damage reduction 5/good (if you normally channel negative energy). At 12th level this damage reduction becomes 10/evil or 10/good, and at 15th level it becomes 15/evil or 15/good (the maximum). Your size modifier for AC and attacks changes as appropriate to your new size category. This spell doesn’t change your speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate to your new size.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you— the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.

All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

#### Rope Trick

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Sor/Wiz 2
- **Components::** V, S, M
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** One touched piece of rope from 5 ft. to 30 ft. long
- **Duration::** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (“planes”). Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope “disappear.” In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.

Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by- 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it’s invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can’t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The _rope trick_ spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

_Note:_ It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one.

_Material Component:_ Powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment.

#### Rusting Grasp

- Transmutation
- **Level::** Drd 4
- **Components::** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
- **Range::** Touch
- **Target::** One nonmagical ferrous object (or the volume of the object within 3 ft. of the touched point) or one ferrous creature
- **Duration::** See text
- **Saving Throw::** None
- **Spell Resistance::** No

Any iron or iron alloy item you touch becomes instantaneously rusted, pitted, and worthless, effectively destroyed. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell.

You may employ _rusting grasp_ in combat with a successful melee touch attack. _Rusting grasp_ used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered) through corrosion.

Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed.

_Note:_ Striking at an opponent’s weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around.

Against a ferrous creature, _rusting grasp_ instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.
