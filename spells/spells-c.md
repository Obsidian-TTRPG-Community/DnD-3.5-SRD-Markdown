Call Lightning
--------------

*   Evocation \[Electricity\]
*   **Level:** Drd 3
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 round
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** One or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell’s range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.

You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).

If you are outdoors and in a stormy area—a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)—each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.

This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.

Call Lightning Storm
--------------------

*   Evocation \[Electricity\]
*   **Level:** Drd 5
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

This spell functions like _call lightning_, except that each bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage (or 5d10 if created outdoors in a stormy area), and you may call a maximum of 15 bolts.

Calm Animals
------------

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Animal 1, Drd 1, Rgr 1
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** Animals within 30 ft. of each other
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not.

The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

Calm Emotions
-------------

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Clr 2, Law 2
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread
*   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but _calm emotions_ can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.

This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as _bless, good hope,_ and _rage,_ as well as negating a bard’s ability to inspire courage or a barbarian’s rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the _confused_ condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect. When the _calm emotions_ spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Cat’s Grace
-----------

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Drd 2, Rgr 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, adding the usual benefits to AC, Reflex saves, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier.

_Material Component:_ A pinch of cat fur.

Cat’s Grace, Mass
-----------------

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 6, Drd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _cat’s grace_, except that it affects multiple creatures.

Cause Fear
----------

*   Necromancy \[Fear, Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Clr 1, Death 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One living creature with 5 or fewer HD
*   **Duration:** 1d4 rounds or 1 round; see text
*   **Saving Throw:** Will partial
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The affected creature becomes frightened. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is shaken for 1 round. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are immune to this effect.

_Cause fear_ counters and dispels _remove fear_.

Chain Lightning
---------------

*   Evocation \[Electricity\]
*   **Level:** Air 6, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Targets:** One primary target, plus one secondary target/level (each of which must be within 30 ft. of the primary target)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike _lightning bolt_, _chain lightning_ strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.

The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (rounded down).

Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

_Focus:_ A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; plus one silver pin for each of your caster levels.

Changestaff
-----------

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 7
*   **Components:** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time:** 1 round
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Your touched staff
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.

_Focus:_ The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).

You cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during the shaping and carving of the staff.

Chaos Hammer
------------

*   Evocation \[Chaotic\]
*   **Level:** Chaos 4
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** 20-ft.-radius burst
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous (1d6 rounds); see text
*   **Saving Throw:** Will partial; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting energy. Only lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slows them for 1d6 rounds (see the _slow_ spell). A successful Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect.

The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.

Charm Animal
------------

*   Enchantment (Charm) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Drd 1, Rgr 1
*   **Target:** One animal

This spell functions like _charm person_, except that it affects a creature of the animal type.

Charm Monster
-------------

*   Enchantment (Charm) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Target:** One living creature
*   **Duration:** One day/level

This spell functions like _charm person_, except that the effect is not restricted by creature type or size.

Charm Monster, Mass
-------------------

*   Enchantment (Charm) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components:** V
*   **Targets:** One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** One day/level

This spell functions like _charm monster,_ except that _mass charm monster_ affects a number of creatures whose combined HD do not exceed twice your level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you choose a creature with too many HD.

Charm Person
------------

*   Enchantment (Charm) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One humanoid creature
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target’s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

The spell does not enable you to control the _charmed_ person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the _charmed_ person breaks the spell. You must speak the person’s language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

Chill Metal
-----------

*   Transmutation \[Cold\]
*   **Level:** Drd 2
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** Metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lb. of metal/level, none of which can be more than 30 ft. away from any of the rest
*   **Duration:** 7 rounds
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

_Chill metal_ makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it’s carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.

On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell’s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.

Round

Metal Temperature

Damage

1

Cold

None

2

Icy

1d4 points

3–5

Freezing

2d4 points

6

Icy

1d4 points

7

Cold

None

Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Underwater, _chill metal_ deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.

_Chill metal_ counters and dispels _heat metal_.

Chill Touch
-----------

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Targets:** Creature or creatures touched (up to one/level)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial or Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.

An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds +1 round per caster level.

Circle of Death
---------------

*   Necromancy \[Death\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Several living creatures within a 40-ft.-radius burst
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A _circle of death_ snuffs out the life force of living creatures, killing them instantly.

The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the burst’s point of origin are affected first. No creature of 9 or more HD can be affected, and Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

_Material Component:_ The powder of a crushed black pearl with a minimum value of 500 gp.

Clairaudience/Clairvoyance
--------------------------

*   Divination (Scrying)
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Knowledge 3, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, F/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** Magical sensor
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

_Clairaudience/clairvoyance_ creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don’t need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known—a place familiar to you or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn’t move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius around the center of the spell’s effect. _Clairaudience/clairvoyance_ functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.

_Arcane Focus:_ A small horn (for hearing) or a glass eye (for seeing).

Clenched Fist
-------------

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 8, Strength 8
*   **Components:** V, S, F/DF

This spell functions like _interposing hand,_ except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.

The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +11 for the hand’s Strength score (33), –1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save (against this spell’s save DC) or be stunned for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

The _clenched fist_ can also interpose itself as _interposing hand_ does, or it can bull rush an opponent as _forceful hand_ does, but at a +15 bonus on the Strength check.

Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.

_Arcane Focus:_ A leather glove.

Cloak of Chaos
--------------

*   Abjuration \[Chaotic\]
*   **Level:** Chaos 8, Clr 8
*   **Components:** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 20 ft.
*   **Targets:** One creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become _confused._ This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike _protection from law_, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.

Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as _protection from law_ does.

Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is _confused_ for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the _confusion_ spell, but against the save DC of _cloak of chaos_).

_Focus:_ A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a scrap of parchment from a chaotic text. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.

Clone
-----

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components:** V, S, M, F
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** 0 ft.
*   **Effect:** One clone
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original’s physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.

To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature’s living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.

When the clone is completed, the original’s soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character). If this Constitution adjustment would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which the original died.

The spell duplicates only the original’s body and mind, not its equipment.

A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.

_Material Component:_ The piece of flesh and various laboratory supplies (cost 1,000 gp).

_Focus:_ Special laboratory equipment (cost 500 gp).

Cloudkill
---------

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a _fog cloud,_ except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).

A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding one’s breath doesn’t help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.

Unlike a _fog cloud_, the _cloudkill_ moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.

Figure out the cloud’s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.

Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

Color Spray
-----------

*   Illusion (Pattern) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 15 ft.
*   **Area:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous; see text
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious.

Each creature within the cone is affected according to its Hit Dice.

_2 HD or less:_ The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)

_3 or 4 HD:_ The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.

_5 or more HD:_ The creature is stunned for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by _color spray_.

_Material Component:_ A pinch each of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue.

Command
-------

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Clr 1
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One living creature
*   **Duration:** 1 round
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.

_Approach:_ On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

_Drop:_ On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can’t pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

_Fall:_ On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.

_Flee:_ On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

_Halt:_ The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.

If the subject can’t carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.

Command, Greater
----------------

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Clr 5
*   **Targets:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level

This spell functions like _command,_ except that up to one creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature’s action after the first, it gets another Will save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.

Command Plants
--------------

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 4, Plant 4, Rgr 3
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** Up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** One day/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as friendly). They will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

You can affect a number of plant creatures whose combined level or HD do not exceed twice your level.

Command Undead
--------------

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** One undead creature
*   **Duration:** One day/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell allows you some degree of control over an undead creature. Assuming the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “come here,” “go there,” “fight,” “stand still,” and so on. Nonintelligent undead won’t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.

Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell.

Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.

_Material Component:_ A shred of raw meat and a splinter of bone.

Commune
-------

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Clr 5
*   **Components:** V, S, M, DF, XP
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level

You contact your deity—or agents thereof —and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity’s knowledge. “Unclear” is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.

The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.

_Material Component:_ Holy (or unholy) water and incense.

_XP Cost:_ 100 XP.

Commune with Nature
-------------------

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Animal 5, Drd 5, Rgr 4
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous

You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting.

In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings—caves, caverns, and the like—the radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.

Comprehend Languages
--------------------

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Clr 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level

You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.

Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the _secret page_ and _illusory script_ spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.

_Comprehend languages_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.

Cone of Cold
------------

*   Evocation \[Cold\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5, Water 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 60 ft.
*   **Area:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Cone of cold_ creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

_Arcane Material Component:_ A very small crystal or glass cone.

Confusion
---------

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 4, Trickery 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Targets:** All creatures in a 15-ft. radius burst
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell causes the targets to become _confused,_ making them unable to independently determine what they will do.

Roll on the following table at the beginning of each subject’s turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.

d%

Behavior

01–10

Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible).

11–20

Act normally.

21–50

Do nothing but babble incoherently.

51–70

Flee away from caster at top possible speed.

71–100

Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject’s self).

A _confused_ character who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a _confused_ character. Any _confused_ character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still _confused_ when its turn comes. Note that a _confused_ character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).

_Arcane Material Component:_ A set of three nut shells.

Confusion, Lesser
-----------------

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 1
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One living creature
*   **Duration:** 1 round

This spell causes a single creature to become _confused_ for 1 round. See the _confusion_ spell, above, to determine the exact effect on the subject.

Consecrate
----------

*   Evocation \[Good\]
*   **Level:** Clr 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Area:** 20-ft.-radius emanation
*   **Duration:** 2 hours/level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell blesses an area with positive energy. Each Charisma check made to turn undead within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a _consecrated_ area suffers minor disruption, giving it a –1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a _consecrated_ area.

If the _consecrated_ area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus on turning checks, –2 penalties for undead in the area). You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron.

If the area does contain an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the _consecrate_ spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

_Consecrate_ counters and dispels _desecrate_.

_Material Component:_ A vial of holy water and 25 gp worth (5 pounds) of silver dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the area.

Contact Other Plane
-------------------

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** Concentration

You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. (See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt.) The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. (All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or some other one-word answer.)

You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. For every two caster levels, you may ask one question.

Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease to Intelligence and Charisma, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the entity answering correctly, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes.

Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.)

On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.

_Avoid Int/Cha Decrease:_ You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. (The entries in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate Elemental Plane.)

**Results of a Successful Contact:** d% is rolled for the result shown on the table:

_True Answer:_ You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly.

_Don’t Know:_ The entity tells you that it doesn’t know.

_Lie:_ The entity intentionally lies to you.

_Random Answer:_ The entity tries to lie but doesn’t know the answer, so it makes one up.

Contagion
---------

*   Necromancy \[Evil\]
*   **Level:** Clr 3, Destruction 3, Drd 3, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Living creature touched
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The subject contracts a disease selected from the table below, which strikes immediately (no incubation period). The DC noted is for the subsequent saves (use _contagion_’s normal save DC for the initial saving throw).

Contingency
-----------

*   Evocation
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M, F
*   **Casting Time:** At least 10 minutes; see text
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** One day/level (D) or until discharged

You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting _contingency_. The _contingency_ spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead.

The spell to be brought into effect by the _contingency_ must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).

The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the _contingency_ immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (_contingency_ and the companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.

You can use only one _contingency_ spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

_Material Component:_ That of the companion spell, plus quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, rakshasa, or similar spell-using creature.

_Focus:_ A statuette of you carved from elephant ivory and decorated with gems (worth at least 1,500 gp). You must carry the focus for the _contingency_ to work.

Continual Flame
---------------

*   Evocation \[Light\]
*   **Level:** Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Object touched
*   **Effect:** Magical, heatless flame
*   **Duration:** Permanent
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A _continual flame_ can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.

Light spells counter and dispel darkness spells of an equal or lower level.

_Material Component:_ You sprinkle ruby dust (worth 50 gp) on the item that is to carry the flame.

Control Plants
--------------

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 8, Plant 8
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** Up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible the controlled plants do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.

Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.

Control Undead
--------------

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** Up to 2 HD/level of undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell enables you to command undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.

Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them.

_Material Component:_ A small piece of bone and a small piece of raw meat.

Control Water
-------------

*   Transmutation \[Water\]
*   **Level:** Clr 4, Drd 4, Sor/Wiz 6, Water 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Water in a volume of 10 ft./level by 10 ft./level by 2 ft./level (S)
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

Depending on the version you choose, the _control water_ spell raises or lowers water.

_Lower Water:_ This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a _slow_ spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.

_Raise Water:_ This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the _lower water_ version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A drop of water (for _raise water_) or a pinch of dust (for _lower water_).

Control Weather
---------------

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Air 7, Clr 7, Drd 7, Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes; see text
*   **Range:** 2 miles
*   **Area:** 2-mile-radius circle, centered on you; see text
*   **Duration:** 4d12 hours; see text
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest.You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.

Season

Possible Weather

Spring

Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather

Summer

Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm

Autumn

Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet

Winter

Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw

Late winter

Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area)

You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.

_Control weather_ can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.

A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle with a 3-mile radius.

Control Winds
-------------

*   Transmutation \[Air\]
*   **Level:** Air 5, Drd 5
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 40 ft./level
*   **Area:** 40 ft./level radius cylinder 40 ft. high
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an “eye” of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit.

_Wind Direction:_ You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell’s area.

*   A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.
*   An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center.
*   A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.
*   A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.

_Wind Strength:_ For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area.

Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.

A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.

A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.

Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.

A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees.

Create Food and Water
---------------------

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level:** Clr 3
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** Food and water to sustain three humans or one horse/level for 24 hours
*   **Duration:** 24 hours; see text
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice—highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a _purify food and water_ spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, and it doesn’t go bad as the food does.

Create Greater Undead
---------------------

*   Necromancy \[Evil\]
*   **Level:** Clr 8, Death 8, Sor/Wiz 8

This spell functions like create undead, except that you can create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead: shadows, wraiths, spectres, and devourers. The type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.

Caster Level

Undead Created

15th or lower

Shadow

16th–17th

Wraith

18th–19th

Spectre

20th or higher

Devourer

Create Undead
-------------

*   Necromancy \[Evil\]
*   **Level:** Clr 6, Death 6, Evil 6, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 hour
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One corpse
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

A much more potent spell than _animate dead,_ this evil spell allows you to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs. The type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.

Caster Level

Undead Created

11th or lower

Ghoul

12th–14th

Ghast

15th–17th

Mummy

18th or higher

Mohrg

You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms.

This spell must be cast at night.

_Material Component:_ A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The spell must be cast on a dead body. You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless shells.

Create Water
------------

*   Conjuration (Creation) \[Water\]
*   **Level:** Clr 0, Drd 0, Pal 1
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** Up to 2 gallons of water/level
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large—possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles.

_Note:_ Conjuration spells can’t create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

Creeping Doom
-------------

*   Conjuration (Summoning)
*   **Level:** Drd 7
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 round
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)/ 100 ft.; see text
*   **Effect:** One swarm of centipedes per two levels
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

When you utter the spell of _creeping doom,_ you call forth a mass of centipede swarms (one per two caster levels, to a maximum of ten swarms at 20th level), which need not appear adjacent to one another.

You may summon the centipede swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. The swarms remain stationary, attacking any creatures in their area, unless you command the creeping doom to move (a standard action). As a standard action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any prey within 100 feet of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but it can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet).

Crushing Despair
----------------

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 30 ft.
*   **Area:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

An invisible cone of despair causes great sadness in the subjects. Each affected creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.

_Crushing despair_ counters and dispels _good hope_.

_Material Component:_ A vial of tears.

Crushing Hand
-------------

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9, Strength 9
*   **Components:** V, S, M, F/DF

This spell functions like _interposing hand,_ except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or crush one opponent that you select.

The _crushing hand_ can grapple an opponent like _grasping hand_ does. Its grapple bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +12 for the hand’s Strength score (35), +4 for being Large. The hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage (lethal, not nonlethal) on each successful grapple check against an opponent.

The _crushing hand_ can also interpose itself as _interposing hand_ does, or it can bull rush an opponent as _forceful hand_ does, but at a +18 bonus.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.
