### Fabricate

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** See text
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** Up to 10 cu. ft./level; see text
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the _fabricate_ spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet.

You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be affected by the spell.

_Material Component:_ The original material, which costs the same amount as the raw materials required to craft the item to be created.

### Faerie Fire

*   Evocation \[Light\]
*   **Level:** Drd 1
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Creatures and objects within a 5-ft.-radius burst
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical _darkness_ effect functions normally), _blur_, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The _faerie fire_ can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The _faerie fire_ does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

### False Life

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level or until discharged; see text

You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 +1 per caster level (maximum +10).

_Material Component:_ A small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits, which you use to trace certain sigils on your body during casting. These sigils cannot be seen once the alcohol or spirits evaporate.

### False Vision

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level:** Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5, Trickery 5
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Area:** 40-ft.-radius emanation
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

Any divination (scrying) spell used to view anything within the area of this spell instead receives a false image (as the _major image_ spell), as defined by you at the time of casting. As long as the duration lasts, you can concentrate to change the image as desired. While you aren’t concentrating, the image remains static.

_Arcane Material Component:_ The ground dust of a piece of jade worth at least 250 gp, which is sprinkled into the air when the spell is cast.

Fear
----

*   Necromancy \[Fear, Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 30 ft.
*   **Area:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level or 1 round; see text
*   **Saving Throw:** Will partial
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in the area to become panicked unless it succeeds on a Will save. If cornered, a panicked creature begins cowering. If the Will save succeeds, the creature is shaken for 1 round.

_Material Component:_ Either the heart of a hen or a white feather.

### Feather Fall

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 free action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** One Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** Until landing or 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. _Feather fall_ instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.

The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature’s maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.

You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn’t your turn.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

_Feather fall_ works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

### Feeblemind

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Target:** One creature
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, its Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a _heal_, _limited wish_, _miracle_, or _wish_ spell is used to cancel the effect of the _feeblemind_. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw.

_Material Component:_ A handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres.

### Find the Path

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Brd 6, Clr 6, Drd 6, Knowledge 6, Travel 6
*   **Components:** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time:** 3 rounds
*   **Range:** Personal or touch
*   **Target:** You or creature touched
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No or Yes (harmless)

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a _maze_ spell. _Find the path_ works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a _glyph of warding._ The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. _Find the path_ can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a _maze_ spell in a single round.

This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians).

_Focus:_ A set of divination counters of the sort you favor.

### Find Traps

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Clr 2
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level

You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You can use the Search skill to detect traps just as a rogue can. In addition, you gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (maximum +10) on Search checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect.

Note that _find traps_ grants no ability to disable the traps that you may find.

### Finger of Death

*   Necromancy \[Death\]
*   **Level:** Drd 8, Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One living creature
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You can slay any one living creature within range. The target is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to survive the attack. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +25).

The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.

### Fire Seeds

*   Conjuration (Creation) \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Drd 6, Fire 6, Sun 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Targets:** Up to four touched acorns or up to eight touched holly berries
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level or until used
*   **Saving Throw:** None or Reflex half; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

Depending on the version of _fire seeds_ you choose, you turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command.

_Acorn Grenades:_ As many as four acorns turn into special splash weapons that can be hurled as far as 100 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), divided up among the acorns as you wish.

Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet. A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.

_Holly Berry Bombs:_ You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature in the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage.

_Material Component:_ The acorns or holly berries.

### Fire Shield

*   Evocation \[Fire or Cold\]
*   **Level:** Fire 5, Sor/Wiz 4, Sun 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).

Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if the _shield_ protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the _shield_ protects against cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.

When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)—blue or green if the _chill shield_ is cast, violet or blue if the _warm shield_ is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.

_Warm Shield:_ The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

_Chill Shield:_ The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A bit of phosphorus for the _warm shield;_ a live firefly or glowworm or the tail portions of four dead ones for the _chill shield_.

### Fire Storm

*   Evocation \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Clr 8, Drd 7, Fire 7
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 round
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Two 10-ft. cubes per level (S)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

When a _fire storm_ spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural vegetation, ground cover, and any plant creatures in the area that you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creature within the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).

### Fire Trap

*   Abjuration \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Object touched
*   **Duration:** Permanent until discharged (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Fire trap_ creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A _fire trap_ can ward any object that can be opened and closed.

When casting _fire trap,_ you select a point on the object as the spell’s center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell’s center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.

A _fire trapped_ item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.

A _knock_ spell does not bypass a _fire trap_. An unsuccessful _dispel magic_ spell does not detonate the spell.

Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.

You can use the _fire trapped_ object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a _fire trapped_ object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.

_Note:_ Magic traps such as _fire trap_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a _fire trap_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid’s _fire trap_ or DC 29 for the arcane version).

_Material Component:_ A half-pound of gold dust (cost 25 gp) sprinkled on the warded object.

### Fireball

*   Evocation \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Area:** 20-ft.-radius spread
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A _fireball_ spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the _fireball_ is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the _fireball_ at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The _fireball_ sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the _fireball_ may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

_Material Component:_ A tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur.

### Flame Arrow

*   Transmutation \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** Fifty projectiles, all of which must be in contact with each other at the time of casting
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You turn ammunition (such as arrows, bolts, shuriken, and stones) into fiery projectiles. Each piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage to any target it hits. A flaming projectile can easily ignite a flammable object or structure, but it won’t ignite a creature it strikes.

_Material Component:_ A drop of oil and a small piece of flint.

### Flame Blade

*   Evocation \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Drd 2
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 0 ft.
*   **Effect:** Sword-like beam
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the _flame blade_ are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A _flame blade_ can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

The spell does not function underwater.

### Flame Strike

*   Evocation \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Clr 5, Drd 4, Sun 5, War 5
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Cylinder (10-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A _flame strike_ produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward. The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.

### Flaming Sphere

*   Evocation \[Fire\]
*   **Level:** Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** 5-ft.-diameter sphere
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A _flaming sphere_ rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A _flaming sphere_ winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron.

Flare
-----

*   Evocation \[Light\]
*   **Level:** Brd 0, Drd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** Burst of light
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst directly in front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled for 1 minute unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by _flare_.

### Flesh to Stone

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Target:** One creature
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells such as _deathwatch_.

Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.

_Material Component:_ Lime, water, and earth.

Fly
---

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 3, Travel 3
*   **Components:** V, S, F/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a _fly_ spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a _fly_ spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the _fly_ spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an _antimagic field_.

_Arcane Focus:_ A wing feather from any bird.

### Floating Disk

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** 3-ft.-diameter disk of force
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. (If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.

_Material Component:_ A drop of mercury.

### Fog Cloud

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level:** Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 2, Water 2
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. level)
*   **Effect:** Fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can’t use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The spell does not function underwater.

### Forbiddance

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Clr 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 6 rounds
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** 60-ft. cube/level (S)
*   **Duration:** Permanent
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Forbiddance_ seals an area against all planar travel into or within it. This includes all teleportation spells (such as _dimension door_ and _teleport), plane shifting,_ astral travel, ethereal travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically.

In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see below). A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is affected as normal.

_Alignments identical:_ No effect. The creature may enter the area freely (although not by planar travel).

_Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or good/evil:_ The creature takes 6d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.

_Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil:_ The creature takes 12d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.

At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which case creatures of alignments different from yours can avoid the damage by speaking the password as they enter the area. You must select this option (and the password) at the time of casting.

_Dispel magic_ does not dispel a _forbiddance_ effect unless the dispeller’s level is at least as high as your caster level.

You can’t have multiple overlapping _forbiddance_ effects. In such a case, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older effect.

_Material Component:_ A sprinkling of holy water and rare incenses worth at least 1,500 gp, plus 1,500 gp per 60-foot cube. If a password is desired, this requires the burning of additional rare incenses worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

### Forcecage

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Area:** Barred cage (20-ft. cube) or windowless cell (10-ft. cube)
*   **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice).

Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

Like a _wall of force_ spell, a _forcecage_ resists _dispel magic,_ but it is vulnerable to a _disintegrate_ spell, and it can be destroyed by a _sphere of annihilation_ or a _rod of cancellation._

_Barred Cage:_ This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a _wall of force_ spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined. You can’t attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.

_Windowless Cell:_ This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.

_Material Component:_ Ruby dust worth 1,500 gp, which is tossed into the air and disappears when you cast the spell.

### Forceful Hand

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, F

This spell functions like _interposing hand,_ except that the _forceful hand_ pursues and pushes away the opponent that you designate. Treat this attack as a bull rush with a +14 bonus on the Strength check (+8 for Strength 27, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets). The hand always moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and it has no speed limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter would instantly reposition itself between the creature and you, but an opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing it.

_Focus:_ A sturdy glove made of leather or heavy cloth.

### Foresight

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Drd 9, Knowledge 9, Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal or touch
*   **Target:** See text
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No or Yes (harmless)

This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once _foresight_ is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.

When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A hummingbird’s feather.

### Fox’s Cunning

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The transmuted creature becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based skill checks and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on Intelligence) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell’s effect do increase. This spell doesn’t grant extra skill points.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a fox.

### Fox’s Cunning, Mass

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _fox’s cunning_, except that it affects multiple creatures.

### Freedom

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) or see text
*   **Target:** One creature
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The subject is freed from spells and effects that restrict its movement, including _binding_, _entangle_, grappling, _imprisonment_, _maze_, paralysis, _petrification_, pinning, _sleep_, _slow_, stunning, _temporal stasis_, and _web_. To free a creature from _imprisonment_ or _maze,_ you must know its name and background, and you must cast this spell at the spot where it was entombed or banished into the _maze_.

### Freedom of Movement

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Brd 4, Clr 4, Drd 4, Luck 4, Rgr 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal or touch
*   **Target:** You or creature touched
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, _solid fog_, _slow_, and _web_. The subject automatically succeeds on any grapple check made to resist a grapple attempt, as well as on grapple checks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.

The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The _freedom of movement_ spell does not, however, allow water breathing.

_Material Component:_ A leather thong, bound around the arm or a similar appendage.

### Freezing Sphere

*   Evocation \[Cold\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Target, Effect, or Area:** See text
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 round/level; see text
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Freezing sphere_ creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. An elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8).

If the _freezing sphere_ strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10- foot square) per caster level (maximum 1,500 square feet). This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the _freezing sphere_ bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.

_Focus:_ A small crystal sphere.

### Gaseous Form

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Air 3, Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Willing corporeal creature touched
*   **Duration:** 2 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and critical hits. It can’t attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials.) The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the _gaseous form_ spell takes effect.

A gaseous creature can’t run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet (maneuverability perfect). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can’t enter water or other liquid. It also can’t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke.

Gate
----

*   Conjuration (Creation or Calling)
*   **Level:** Clr 9, Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Components:** V, S, XP; see text
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** See text
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous or concentration (up to 1 round/level); see text
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

Casting a _gate_ spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.

Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the _gate._

The _gate_ itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster’s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.

A _gate_ has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the _gate_ from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.

_Planar Travel:_ As a mode of planar travel, a _gate_ spell functions much like a _plane shift_ spell, except that the _gate_ opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a _gate_ from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A _gate_ cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.

You may hold the _gate_ open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.

_Calling Creatures:_ The second effect of the _gate_ spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the _gate_ to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the _gate,_ although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a _gate_ that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).

If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.

A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature’s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.

If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the _lesser planar ally_ spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.

Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.

_Note:_ When you use a calling spell such as _gate_ to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.

_XP Cost:_ 1,000 XP (only for the _calling creatures_ function).

### Geas/Quest

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 6, Clr 6, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Target:** One living creature
*   **Saving Throw:** None

This spell functions similarly to _lesser geas,_ except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with _lesser geas_), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the _geas/quest_. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the _geas/ quest_.

A _remove curse_ spell ends a _geas/quest_ spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. _Break enchantment_ does not end a _geas/quest_, but _limited wish_, _miracle_, and _wish_ do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as _geas,_ while clerics call the same spell _quest_.

### Geas, Lesser

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 round
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target:** One living creature with 7 HD or less
*   **Duration:** One day/level or until discharged (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A _lesser geas_ places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you. While a _geas_ cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The _geased_ creature must follow the given instructions until the _geas_ is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions:

If the subject is prevented from obeying the _lesser geas_ for 24 hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the _lesser geas._

A _lesser geas_ (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by _break enchantment_, _limited wish_, _remove curse_, _miracle_, or _wish_. _Dispel magic_ does not affect a _lesser geas_.

### Gentle Repose

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Clr 2, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Corpse touched
*   **Duration:** One day/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see _raise dead_). Days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.

The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A pinch of salt, and a copper piece for each eye the corpse has (or had).

### Ghost Sound

*   Illusion (Figment)
*   **Level:** Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** Illusory sounds
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

_Ghost sound_ allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound _ghost sound_ creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound’s basic character.

The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a _ghost sound_ spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

_Ghost sound_ can enhance the effectiveness of a _silent image_ spell.

_Ghost sound_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

_Material Component:_ A bit of wool or a small lump of wax.

### Ghoul Touch

*   Necromancy
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Living humanoid touched
*   **Duration:** 1d6+2 rounds
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful melee touch attack.

Additionally, the paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become sickened (Fortitude negates). A _neutralize poison_ spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench.

_Material Component:_ A small scrap of cloth taken from clothing worn by a ghoul, or a pinch of earth from a ghoul’s lair.

### Giant Vermin

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Clr 4, Drd 4
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Targets:** Up to three vermin, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into larger forms. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size. The size to which the vermin can be grown depends on your level; see the table below.

Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (“Attack,” “Defend,” “Stop,” and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.

Caster Level

Vermin Size

9th or lower

Medium

10th–13th

Large

14th–17th

Huge

18th–19th

Gargantuan

20th or higher

Colossal

### Glibness

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 3
*   **Components:** S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Target:** You
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)

Your speech becomes fluent and more believable. You gain a +30 bonus on Bluff checks made to convince another of the truth of your words. (This bonus doesn’t apply to other uses of the Bluff skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a hidden message via innuendo.)

If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.

### Glitterdust

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area:** Creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (blinding only)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades.

Any creature covered by the dust takes a –40 penalty on Hide checks.

_Material Component:_ Ground mica.

### Globe of Invulnerability

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6

This spell functions like _lesser globe of invulnerability,_ except that it also excludes 4th-level spells and spell-like effects.

### Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 10 ft.
*   **Area:** 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the _lesser globe of invulnerability_. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a targeted _dispel magic_ spell, but not by an area _dispel magic._ You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.

Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.

If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether _lesser globe of invulnerability_ stops it.

_Material Component:_ A glass or crystal bead that shatters at the expiration of the spell.

### Glyph of Warding

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Clr 3
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target or Area:** Object touched or up to 5 sq. ft./level
*   **Duration:** Permanent until discharged (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** No (object) and Yes; see text

This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A _glyph of warding_ can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.

You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, _glyphs_ can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. _Glyphs_ can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. _Glyphs_ respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple _glyphs_ cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.

When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A _glyph_ can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the _glyph_ and tracery become nearly invisible.

_Glyphs_ cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. _Mislead_, _polymorph_, and _nondetection_ (and similar magical effects) can fool a _glyph_, though nonmagical disguises and the like can’t. _Read magic_ allows you to identify a _glyph of warding_ with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the _glyph_ does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the _glyph_ (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).

_Note:_ Magic traps such as _glyph of warding_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the _glyph_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for _glyph of warding_.

Depending on the version selected, a _glyph_ either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.

_Blast Glyph:_ A _blast glyph_ deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster’s choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.

_Spell Glyph:_ You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the _glyph._ If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the _glyph_.

_Material Component:_ You trace the _glyph_ with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp.

### Glyph of Warding, Greater

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Clr 6

This spell functions like _glyph of warding,_ except that a _greater blast glyph_ deals up to 10d8 points of damage, and a _greater spell glyph_ can store a spell of 6th level or lower.

_Material Component:_ You trace the _glyph_ with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 400 gp.

*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Targets:** 2d4 fresh berries touched
*   **Duration:** One day/level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Casting _goodberry_ upon a handful of freshly picked berries makes 2d4 of them magical. You (as well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level) can immediately discern which berries are affected. Each transmuted berry provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature. The berry also cures 1 point of damage when eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any 24-hour period.

### Good Hope

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level:** Brd 3
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Targets:** One living creature/level, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

This spell instills powerful hope in the subjects. Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.

_Good hope_ counters and dispels _crushing despair_.

### Grasping Hand

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7, Strength 7
*   **Components:** V, S, F/DF

This spell functions like _interposing hand,_ except the hand can also grapple one opponent that you select. The _grasping hand_ gets one grapple attack per round.

Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for wizards, clerics, and sorcerers, respectively), +10 for the hand’s Strength score (31), –1 for being Large. Its grapple bonus is this same figure, except with a +4 modifier for being Large instead of –1. The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

The _grasping hand_ can also bull rush an opponent as _forceful hand_ does, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check (+10 for Strength 35, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets), or interpose itself as _interposing hand_ does.

Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.

_Arcane Focus:_ A leather glove.

### Grease

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target or Area:** One object or a 10-ft. square
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

A _grease_ spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can’t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the _greased_ item. A creature wearing _greased_ armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.

_Material Component:_ A bit of pork rind or butter.

### Greater (Spell Name)

*   Any spell whose name begins with _greater_ is alphabetized in this chapter according to the second word of the spell name. Thus, the description of a _greater_ spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains that have _greater_ spells in them include those based on the spells _arcane sight, command, dispel magic, glyph of warding, invisibility, magic fang, magic weapon, planar ally, planar binding, prying eyes, restoration, scrying, shadow conjuration, shadow evocation, shout,_ and _teleport._

### Guards and Wards

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M, F
*   **Casting Time:** 30 minutes
*   **Range:** Anywhere within the area to be warded
*   **Area:** Up to 200 sq. ft./level (S)
*   **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** See text

This powerful spell is primarily used to defend your stronghold. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.

_Fog:_ Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.

_Arcane Locks:_ All doors in the warded area are _arcane locked._ Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.

_Webs:_ Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the _web_ spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for _web_. Spell Resistance: No.

_Confusion:_ Where there are choices in direction—such as a corridor intersection or side passage—a minor _confusion_\-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: Yes.

_Lost Doors:_ One door per caster level is covered by a _silent image_ to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: No.

In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.

1\. _Dancing lights_ in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.

2\. A _magic mouth_ in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.

3\. A _stinking cloud_ in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for _stinking cloud._ Spell Resistance: No.

4\. A _gust of wind_ in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.

5\. A _suggestion_ in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the _suggestion_ mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.

The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A _dispel magic_ cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful _Mage’s disjunction_ destroys the entire _guards and wards_ effect.

_Material Component:_ Burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of blood.

_Focus:_ A small silver rod.

### Guidance

*   Divination
*   **Level:** Clr 0, Drd 0
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Target:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** 1 minute or until discharged
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance. The creature gets a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.

### Gust of Wind

*   Evocation \[Air\]
*   **Level:** Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 60 ft.
*   **Effect:** Line-shaped gust of severe wind emanating out from you to the extreme of the range
*   **Duration:** 1 round
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path.

A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4x10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.

Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x10 feet.

Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x5 feet.

Large or larger creatures may move normally within a _gust of wind_ effect.

A _gust of wind_ can’t move a creature beyond the limit of its range.

Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a _gust of wind_.

The force of the _gust_ automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.

In addition to the effects noted, a _gust of wind_ can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

_Gust of wind_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.
