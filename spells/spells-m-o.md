#### Mage Armor

*   Conjuration (Creation) \[Force\]
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components::** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** Creature touched
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a _mage armor_ spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.

Unlike mundane armor, _mage armor_ entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since _mage armor_ is made of force, incorporeal creatures can’t bypass it the way they do normal armor.

_Focus_:: A piece of cured leather.

#### Mage Hand

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One nonmagical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lb.
*   **Duration::** Concentration
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell’s range.

#### Mage’s Disjunction

*   Abjuration
*   **Level::** Magic 9, Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Components::** V
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Area::** All magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft.-radius burst
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a _dispel magic_ spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature’s possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor’s Will save bonus, whichever is higher.

You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an _antimagic field._ If the _antimagic field_ survives the _disjunction,_ no items within it are disjoined.

Even artifacts are subject to _disjunction,_ though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even _miracle_ or _wish_.)

_Note:_ Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.

#### Mage’s Faithful Hound

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components::** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect::** Phantom watchdog
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/caster level or until discharged, then 1 round/caster level; see text
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.

If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature.

The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder’s turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.

The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.

_Material Component:_ A tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread.

#### Mage’s Lucubration

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Wiz 6
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Personal
*   **Target::** You
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous

You instantly recall any one spell of 5th level or lower that you have used during the past 24 hours. The spell must have been actually cast during that period. The recalled spell is stored in your mind as through prepared in the normal fashion.

If the recalled spell requires material components, you must provide them. The recovered spell is not usable until the material components are available.

#### Mage’s Magnificent Mansion

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components::** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect::** Extradimensional mansion, up to three 10-ft. cubes/level (S)
*   **Duration::** 2 hours/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell’s effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as _unseen servant_ spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

_Focus_:: A miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon (each item worth 5 gp).

#### Mage’s Private Sanctum

*   Abjuration
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components::** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Area::** 30-ft. cube/level (S)
*   **Duration::** 24 hours (D)
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally.

Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to _detect thoughts_. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other communication, such as a _sending_ or _message_ spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar.

The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.

_Mage’s private sanctum_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

_Material Component:_ A thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite.

#### Mage’s Sword

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components::** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect::** One sword
*   **Duration::** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

This spell brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Int bonus or your Cha bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19–20 and a critical multiplier of x2.

The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers.

Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round’s target.

The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but _dispel magic_, _disintegrate_, a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. The sword’s AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time _Mage’s sword_ strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

_Focus_:: A miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc. It costs 250 gp to construct.

#### Magic Aura

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level::** Brd 1, Magic 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components::** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** One touched object weighing up to 5 lb./level
*   **Duration::** One day/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw::** None; see text
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

You alter an item’s aura so that it registers to _detect_ spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify.

If the object bearing _magic aura_ has _identify_ cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object’s actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.

If the targeted item’s own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), _magic aura_ doesn’t work.

_Note:_ A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.

_Focus_:: A small square of silk that must be passed over the object that receives the aura.

#### Magic Circle Against Chaos

*   Abjuration \[Lawful\]
*   **Level::** Clr 3, Law 3, Pal 3, Sor/Wiz 3

This spell functions like _magic circle against evil,_ except that it is similar to _protection from chaos_ instead of _protection from evil_, and it can imprison a nonlawful called creature.

#### Magic Circle Against Evil

*   Abjuration \[Good\]
*   **Level::** Clr 3, Good 3, Pal 3, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components::** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Area::** 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature
*   **Duration::** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance::** No; see text

All creatures within the area gain the effects of a _protection from evil_ spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome a creature’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of _protection from evil_), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’ spell resistance.

This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A _magic circle against evil_ can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the _lesser planar binding, planar binding,_ and _greater planar binding_ spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the _magic circle_. The creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal _protection from evil_ spell for that creature only.

A _magic circle_ leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (_astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport,_ and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a _dimensional anchor_ spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the _anchor_ effect lasts as long as the _magic circle_ does. The creature cannot reach across the _magic circle,_ but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.

You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the _magic circle_ more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.

A successful diagram allows you to cast a _dimensional anchor_ spell on the _magic circle_ during the round before casting any summoning spell. The _anchor_ holds any called creatures in the _magic circle_ for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a _magic circle_ prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the _lesser planar binding_ spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.

This spell is not cumulative with _protection from evil_ and vice versa.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

#### Magic Circle Against Good

*   Abjuration \[Evil\]
*   **Level::** Clr 3, Evil 3, Sor/Wiz 3

This spell functions like _magic circle against evil,_ except that it is similar to _protection from good_ instead of _protection from evil_, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.

#### Magic Circle Against Law

*   Abjuration \[Chaotic\]
*   **Level::** Chaos 3, Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 3

This spell functions like _magic circle against evil,_ except that it is similar to _protection from law_ instead of _protection from evil_, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.

#### Magic Fang

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Drd 1, Rgr 1
*   **Components::** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** Living creature touched
*   **Duration::** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

_Magic fang_ gives one natural weapon of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon. (The spell does not change an unarmed strike’s damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage.)

_Magic fang_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

#### Magic Fang, Greater

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Drd 3, Rgr 3
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One living creature
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level

This spell functions like _magic fang_, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5).

Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature’s natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).

_Greater magic fang_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

#### Magic Jar

*   Necromancy
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components::** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Target::** One creature
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level or until you return to your body
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

By casting _magic jar,_ you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the _magic jar_), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the _magic jar._ You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.

To cast the spell, the _magic jar_ must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.

While in the _magic jar,_ you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)

You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.

Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by _protection from evil_ or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature’s soul into the _magic jar_ unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the _magic jar,_ and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.

If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the _magic jar._ You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body’s extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.

As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the _magic jar_ if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.

If the host body is slain, you return to the _magic jar,_ if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.

If the spell ends while you are in the _magic jar,_ you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the _magic jar_ returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the _magic jar_ or at the host’s location.

_Focus_:: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp.

#### Magic Missile

*   Evocation \[Force\]
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Targets::** Up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile—two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

#### Magic Mouth

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level::** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components::** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One creature or object
*   **Duration::** Permanent until discharged
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (object)

This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, _magic mouth_ can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical _darkness_ or _invisibility_ does. Silent movement or magical _silence_ defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A _magic mouth_ cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a _magic mouth_ to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

_Magic mouth_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

_Material Component:_ A small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth 10 gp.

#### Magic Stone

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Clr 1, Drd 1, Earth 1
*   **Components::** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Targets::** Up to three pebbles touched
*   **Duration::** 30 minutes or until discharged
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless, object)

You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The user of the stones makes a normal ranged attack. Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage (including the spell’s enhancement bonus), or 2d6+2 points against undead.

#### Magic Vestment

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Clr 3, Strength 3, War 3
*   **Components::** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** Armor or shield touched
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless, object)

You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.

#### Magic Weapon

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Clr 1, Pal 1, Sor/Wiz 1, War 1
*   **Components::** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** Weapon touched
*   **Duration::** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless, object)

_Magic weapon_ gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon’s +1 bonus on attack rolls.)

You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see _magic fang_). A monk’s unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.

#### Magic Weapon, Greater

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Clr 4, Pal 3, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Components::** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One weapon or fifty projectiles (all of which must be in contact with each other at the time of casting)
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless, object)

This spell functions like _magic weapon,_ except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5).

Alternatively, you can affect as many as fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.)

_Arcane Material Component:_ Powdered lime and carbon.

#### Major Creation

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Duration::** See text

This spell functions like _minor creation,_ except that you can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal, metal, or the like. The duration of the created item varies with its relative hardness and rarity, as indicated on the following table.

Hardness and Rarity Examples

Duration

Vegetable matter

2 hr./level

Stone, crystal, base metals

1 hr./level

Precious metals

20 min./level

Gems

10 min./level

Rare metal1

1 round/level

1 Includes adamantine, alchemical silver, and mithral. You can’t use major creation to create a cold iron item.

#### Major Image

*   Illusion (Figment)
*   **Level::** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3
*   **Duration::** Concentration + 3 rounds

This spell functions like _silent image,_ except that sound, smell, and thermal illusions are included in the spell effect. While concentrating, you can move the image within the range.

The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately.

#### Make Whole

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Clr 2
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One object of up to 10 cu. ft./ level

This spell functions like _mending,_ except that _make whole_ completely repairs an object made of any substance, even one with multiple breaks, to be as strong as new. The spell does not restore the magical abilities of a broken magic item made whole, and it cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands. The spell does not repair items that have been warped, burned, disintegrated, ground to powder, melted, or vaporized, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).

#### Mark of Justice

*   Necromancy
*   **Level::** Clr 5, Pal 4
*   **Components::** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** Creature touched
*   **Duration::** Permanent; see text
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of _bestow curse_.

Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained.

Like the effect of _bestow curse_, a _mark of justice_ cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a _break enchantment_, _limited wish_, _miracle_, _remove curse_, or _wish_ spell. _Remove curse_ works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your _mark of justice_ caster level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated.

#### Mass (Spell Name)

*   Any spell whose name begins with _mass_ is alphabetized in this chapter according to the second word of the spell name. Thus, the description of a _mass_ spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains that have _mass_ spells in them include those based on the spells _bear’s endurance, bull’s strength, cat’s grace, charm monster, cure critical wounds, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, cure serious wounds, eagle’s splendor, enlarge person, fox’s cunning, heal, hold monster, hold person, inflict critical wounds, inflict light wounds, inflict moderate wounds, inflict serious wounds, invisibility, owl’s wisdom, reduce person,_ and _suggestion._

Maze
----

*   Conjuration (Teleportation)
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One creature
*   **Duration::** See text
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn’t escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave.

On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the _maze_ spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as _teleport_ and _dimension door,_ do not help a creature escape a _maze_ spell, although a _plane shift_ spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.

#### Meld Into Stone

*   Transmutation \[Earth\]
*   **Level::** Clr 3, Drd 3
*   **Components::** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Personal
*   **Target::** You
*   **Duration::** 10 min./level

_Meld into stone_ enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.

While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone’s complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save.

Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell’s duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.

The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: _Stone to flesh_ expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. _Stone shape_ deals you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. _Transmute rock to mud_ expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, _passwall_ expels you without damage.

#### Mending

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Brd 0, Clr 0, Drd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** 10 ft.
*   **Target::** One object of up to 1 lb.
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless, object)

_Mending_ repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps, such as might be caused by a _warp wood_ spell). It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists.

Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by _mending._ The spell can repair a magic item, but the item’s magical abilities are not restored. The spell cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).

#### Message

*   Transmutation \[Language-Dependent\]
*   **Level::** Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
*   **Components::** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Targets::** One creature/level
*   **Duration::** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical _silence,_ 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path’s entire length lies within the spell’s range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn’t transcend language barriers.

_Note:_ To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper, possibly allowing observers the opportunity to read your lips.

_Focus_:: A short piece of copper wire.

#### Meteor Swarm

*   Evocation \[Fire\]
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Area::** Four 40-ft.-radius spreads; see text
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw::** None or Reflex half; see text
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

_Meteor swarm_ is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to _fireball_ in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2- foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.

If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and receives no saving throw against the sphere’s fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target’s space. You may aim more than one meteor at the same target.

Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. (Fire resistance applies to each sphere’s damage individually.)

#### Mind Blank

*   Abjuration
*   **Level::** Protection 8, Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One creature
*   **Duration::** 24 hours
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless)

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. _Mind blank_ even foils _limited wish_, _miracle_, and _wish_ spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject’s mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as _arcane eye,_ the spell works but the creature simply isn’t detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.

#### Mind Fog

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level::** Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect::** Fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
*   **Duration::** 30 minutes and 2d6 rounds; see text
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

_Mind fog_ produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the _mind fog_ take a –10 competence penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves. (A creature that successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in four rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.

#### Minor Creation

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components::** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time::** 1 minute
*   **Range::** 0 ft.
*   **Effect::** Unattended, nonmagical object of nonliving plant matter, up to 1 cu. ft./level
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to make a complex item.

Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail.

_Material Component:_ A tiny piece of matter of the same sort of item you plan to create with _minor creation_.

#### Minor Image

*   Illusion (Figment)
*   **Level::** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Duration::** Concentration +2 rounds

This spell functions like _silent image_, except that _minor image_ includes some minor sounds but not understandable speech.

#### Miracle

*   Evocation
*   **Level::** Clr 9, Luck 9
*   **Components::** V, S, XP; see text
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** See text
*   **Target, Effect, or Area::** See text
*   **Duration::** See text
*   **Saving Throw::** See text
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You don’t so much cast a _miracle_ as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.

A _miracle_ can do any of the following things.

*   Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains).
*   Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
*   Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _feeblemind_ or _insanity_.
*   Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.

    If the _miracle_ has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost.

    Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a _miracle_ costs the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful _miracles_ of this sort could include the following.

*   Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
*   Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.
*   Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.

In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity’s (or alignment’s) nature is refused.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a _miracle_ duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a _miracle_ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.

_XP Cost:_ 5,000 XP (for some uses of the _miracle_ spell; see above).

#### Mirage Arcana

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level::** Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Area::** One 20-ft. cube/level (S)
*   **Duration::** Concentration +1 hour/ level (D)

This spell functions like _hallucinatory terrain_, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike _hallucinatory terrain,_ the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still, it can’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location).

#### Mirror Image

*   Illusion (Figment)
*   **Level::** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Personal; see text
*   **Target::** You
*   **Duration::** 1 min./level (D)

Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.

_Mirror image_ creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a _mirror image._ When you and the _mirror image_ separate, observers can’t use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.

Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image’s AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they’re burned or dead after being hit by a _fireball_).

While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.

An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)

#### Misdirection

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level::** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One creature or object, up to a 10-ft. cube in size
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level
*   **Saving Throw::** None or Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (_detect evil, detect magic, discern lies,_ and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of _misdirection_ is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect.) Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (_augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance,_ and the like).

#### Mislead

*   Illusion (Figment, Glamer)
*   **Level::** Brd 5, Luck 6, Sor/Wiz 6, Trickery 6
*   **Components::** S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target/Effect::** You/one illusory double
*   **Duration::** 1 round/level (D) and concentration + 3 rounds; see text
*   **Saving Throw::** None or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

You become invisible (as _improved invisibility_, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as _major image,_ a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don’t notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.

The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The _improved invisibility_ lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.

#### Mnemonic Enhancer

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Wiz 4
*   **Components::** V, S, M, F
*   **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
*   **Range::** Personal
*   **Target::** You
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous

Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or retain spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast.

_Prepare:_ You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally.

_Retain:_ You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the _mnemonic enhancer_. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind.

In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).

_Material Component:_ A piece of string, and ink consisting of squid secretion with black dragon’s blood.

_Focus_:: An ivory plaque of at least 50 gp value.

#### Modify Memory

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
*   **Level::** Brd 4
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 round; see text
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One living creature
*   **Duration::** Permanent
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You reach into the subject’s mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.

*   Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate _charm, geas/quest, suggestion,_ or similar spells.
*   Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.
*   Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.
*   Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.

Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell’s range during this time, the spell is lost.

A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject’s actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine.

#### Moment of Prescience

*   Divination
*   **Level::** Luck 8, Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Personal
*   **Target::** You
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level or until discharged

This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself. Once during the spell’s duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flatfooted). Activating the effect doesn’t take an action; you can even activate it on another character’s turn if needed. You must choose to use the _moment of prescience_ before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends.

You can’t have more than one _moment of prescience_ active on you at the same time.

Mount
-----

*   Conjuration (Summoning)
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components::** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time::** 1 round
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect::** One mount
*   **Duration::** 2 hours/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

You summon a light horse or a pony (your choice) to serve you as a mount. The steed serves willingly and well. The mount comes with a bit and bridle and a riding saddle.

_Material Component:_ A bit of horse hair.

#### Move Earth

*   Transmutation \[Earth\]
*   **Level::** Drd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components::** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time::** See text
*   **Range::** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Area::** Dirt in an area up to 750 ft. square and up to 10 ft. deep (S)
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

_Move earth_ moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.

However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.

This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.

The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.

This spell has no effect on earth creatures.

_Material Component:_ A mixture of soils (clay, loam, and sand) in a small bag, and an iron blade.

#### Neutralize Poison

*   Conjuration (Healing)
*   **Level::** Brd 4, Clr 4, Drd 3, Pal 4, Rgr 3
*   **Components::** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** Creature or object of up to 1 cu. ft./level touched
*   **Duration::** 10 min./level
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless, object)

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don’t go away on their own.

The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with _delay poison_, such effects aren’t postponed until after the duration —the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.

This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the caster’s option.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A bit of charcoal.

#### Nightmare

*   Illusion (Phantasm) \[Mind-Affecting, Evil\]
*   **Level::** Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 10 minutes
*   **Range::** Unlimited
*   **Target::** One living creature
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate.

The _nightmare_ prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The _nightmare_ leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.

The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.

Knowledge

Will Save Modifier

None1

+10

Secondhand (you have heard of the subject)

+5

Firsthand (you have met the subject)

+0

Familiar (you know the subject well)

–5

1 You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of.

Connection

Will Save Modifier

Likeness or picture

–2

Possession or garment

–4

Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.

–10

_Dispel evil_ cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the _nightmare_ and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the _dispel evil_.

If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell ends.

If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.

You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You always fail any saving throw, for example.)

Creatures who don’t sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or dream are immune to this spell.

#### Nondetection

*   Abjuration
*   **Level::** Rgr 4, Sor/Wiz 3, Trickery 3
*   **Components::** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** Creature or object touched
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (harmless, object)

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as _clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object,_ and _detect_ spells. _Nondetection_ also prevents location by such magic items as _crystal balls._If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast _nondetection_. If you cast _nondetection_ on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

If cast on a creature, _nondetection_ wards the creature’s gear as well as the creature itself.

_Material Component:_ A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.

#### Obscure Object

*   Abjuration
*   **Level::** Brd 1, Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components::** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** One object touched of up to 100 lb./level
*   **Duration::** 8 hours (D)
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (object)

This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying) effects, such as the _scrying_ spell or a _crystal ball_. Such an attempt automatically fails (if the divination is targeted on the object) or fails to perceive the object (if the divination is targeted on a nearby location, object, or person).

_Arcane Material Component:_ A piece of chameleon skin.

#### Obscuring Mist

*   Conjuration (Creation)
*   **Level::** Air 1, Clr 1, Drd 1, Sor/Wiz 1, Water 1
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** 20 ft.
*   **Effect::** Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius from you, 20 ft. high
*   **Duration::** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw::** None
*   **Spell Resistance::** No

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a _gust of wind_ spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A _fireball, flame strike_, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell’s area. A _wall of fire_ burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

#### Open/Close

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
*   **Components::** V, S, F
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** Object weighing up to 30 lb. or portal that can be opened or closed
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes (object)

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell’s ability to affect.

_Focus_:: A brass key.

#### Order’s Wrath

*   Evocation \[Lawful\]
*   **Level::** Law 4
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Area::** Nonlawful creatures within a burst that fills a 30-ft. cube
*   **Duration::** Instantaneous (1 round); see text
*   **Saving Throw::** Will partial; see text
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

You channel lawful power to smite enemies. The power takes the form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only chaotic and neutral (not lawful) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them to be dazed for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

#### Overland Flight

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Sor/Wiz 5
*   **Components::** V, S
*   **Range::** Personal
*   **Target::** You
*   **Duration::** 1 hour/level

This spell functions like a _fly_ spell, except you can fly at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with average maneuverability. When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). This means you can cover 64 miles in an eight-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).

#### Owl’s Wisdom

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Clr 2, Drd 2, Pal 2, Rgr 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components::** V, S, M/DF
*   **Casting Time::** 1 standard action
*   **Range::** Touch
*   **Target::** Creature touched
*   **Duration::** 1 min./level
*   **Saving Throw::** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance::** Yes

The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive _owl’s wisdom_ do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells increase.

_Arcane Material Component:_ A few feathers, or a pinch of droppings, from an owl.

#### Owl’s Wisdom, Mass

*   Transmutation
*   **Level::** Clr 6, Drd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Range::** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Target::** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _owl’s wisdom_, except that it affects multiple creatures.
