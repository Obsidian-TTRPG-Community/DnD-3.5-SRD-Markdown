The darkmantle hangs from a ceiling by a muscular "foot" at the top of its body. It can look like a stalactite, by holding its tentacles stiffly under itself, or like a lump of rock, spreading its tentacles so the membrane between them covers its body. Its shell and skin usually resemble limestone, but a darkmantle can change its color to match almost any type of stony background. 

A darkmantle is about 4 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the top of its head. It weighs about 30 pounds. 

#### Combat

A darkmantle attacks by dropping onto its prey and wrapping its tentacles around the opponent's head. Once attached, it squeezes and tries to suffocate the foe. A darkmantle that misses its initial attack often flies up and tries to drop on the opponent again. 

#### Darkness (Su)
Once per day a darkmantle can cause darkness as the *darkness* spell (caster level 5th). It most often uses this ability just before attacking. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a darkmantle must hit a Large or smaller creature with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

If it wins the grapple check, it attaches to the opponent's head and can constrict. 

#### Constrict (Ex)
A darkmantle deals 1d4+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check. 

#### Blindsight (Ex)
A darkmantle can "see" by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain objects and creatures within 90 feet. A *silence* spell negates this ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle. 

#### Skills
A darkmantle has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. 

These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated. The creature's variable coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

A delver is about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. It weighs about 6,000 pounds. 

Delvers speak Terran and Undercommon. 

#### Combat

A delver prefers to fight from its tunnel, which it uses to protect its flanks while lashing out with its flippers. 

A delver expecting trouble may honeycomb an area with tunnels, leaving most closed with layers of stone 1 or 2 inches thick. 

The delver can quickly dissolve the stone cover and pop up to attack unexpectedly. 

#### Corrosive Slime (Ex)
A delver produces a mucuslike slime that contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly effective against stone. A delver's mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, a delver's slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points of damage. A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An opponent's armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons takes damage from its slime each time an attack hits unless the creature succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. These save DCs are Constitution-based. 

#### Stone Shape (Ex)
A delver can alter its slime to temporarily soften stone instead of dissolving it. Once every 10 minutes, a delver can soften and shape up to 25 cubic feet of stone, as a *stone shape* spell (caster level 15th). 

## Demon

Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it---even other demons. 

Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). 

- Immunity to electricity and poison.

- Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10.

- *Summon* (Sp): Many demons share the ability to summon others of
their kind (the success chance and type of demon summoned are noted in each monster description). Demons are often reluctant to use this power until in obvious peril or extreme circumstances. 

- Telepathy.

Except where otherwise noted, demons speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.

| Organization: | Solitary or gang (3--6) | 
| Challenge Rating: | 6 | 
| Treasure: | Standard | 
| Alignment: | Always chaotic evil | 
| Advancement: | 8--14 HD (Large); 15--21 HD (Huge) | 
| Level Adjustment: | --- | 
A babau is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 140 pounds. 

#### Combat

Babaus are sneaky and sly. They attack the most powerful foe first, hoping to eliminate the true threats quickly and then toy with the rest. When ambushing their opponents, they make excellent use of the combination of multiple attacks and sneak attacks. 

A babau's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Sneak Attack (Ex)
A babau can make a sneak attack like a rogue, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage whenever a foe is denied his or her Dexterity bonus, or when the babau is flanking. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Darkness\|Darkness]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Dispel Magic\|Dispel Magic]] , [[3.5 Spell List#See Invisibility\|See Invisibility]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Teleport, Greater\|Teleport, Greater]] (self Plus 50 Pounds Of Objects Only);
 -  Caster level 7th.

#### Protective Slime (Su)
A slimy red jelly coats the babau's skin. Any weapon that touches it takes 1d8 points of acid damage from the corrosive goo, and the weapon's hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic weapon may attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid taking this damage. A creature who strikes the babau with an unarmed attack, unarmed strike, touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage as well but can negate the damage with a DC 18 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based. 

***Summon Demon* (Sp):**Once per day a babau can attempt to summon 1 babau with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell. 

#### Skills
Babaus have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Search checks.

| Challenge Rating: | 20 | 
| Treasure: | Standard coins; double goods; standard items, plus *+1 vorpal greatsword* and *+1 flaming whip* | 
| Alignment: | Always chaotic evil |

| Level Adjustment: | --- | 
A balor stands about 12 feet tall. Its skin is usually dark red. It weighs about 4,500 pounds. 

#### Combat

Balors love to join battle armed with their swords and whips. If they face stiff resistance, they may teleport away to loose a few spell-like effects at the foe. 

A balor's *+1 flaming whip* is a long, flexible weapon with many tails tipped with hooks, spikes, and balls. The weapon deals bludgeoning and slashing damage, in addition to fire damage. 

A balor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

**Death Throes (Ex):**When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding flash of light that deals 100 points of damage to anything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 30 half ). This explosion automatically destroys any weapons the balor is holding. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Entangle (Ex)
A balor's *+1 flaming whip* entangles foes much like an attack with a net. The whip has 20 hit points. The whip needs no folding. If it hits, the target and the balor immediately make opposed Strength checks; if the balor wins, it drags the target against its flaming body (see below). The target remains anchored against the balor's body until it escapes the whip. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities

 -  Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Vorpal Sword (Su)
Every balor carries a *+1 vorpal longsword* that looks like a flame or a bolt of lightning. 

#### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a balor can automatically summon 4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrous, or one nalfeshnee, glabrezu, marilith, or balor. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. 

#### Flaming Body (Su)
The body of a balor is wreathed in flame. 

Anyone grappling a balor takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round. 

#### True Seeing (Su)
Balors have a continuous true seeing ability, as the spell (caster level 20th). 

#### Skills
Balors have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. 

#### Tactics Round-by-Round

The balor is most effective as a ranged combatant, using its spell-like abilities to attack from a distance. 

Prior to combat: Unholy aura. 

*Round 1: Fire storm* or *implosion* and quickened *telekinesis,* or summon additional demons. If the balor does not deem itself seriously threatened, it conserves abilities usable only once per day and uses *blasphemy* instead. 

*Round 2: Insanity* or *power word stun.* 

*Round 3:* Full melee attack with weapons, including entangle with whip. 

*Round 4: Teleport* or fly away with entangled foe to reestablish range; repeat round 1 and continue. 

A balor who wants to drive off or neutralize a party without slaying its foes avoids lethal attacks. 

Prior to combat: Unholy aura. 

Round 1: Dominate monster. 

Round 2: Power word stun. 

*Round 3: Insanity* or *telekinesis* to incapacitate or repel a dangerous opponent. 

*Round 4: Teleport* or fly away to reestablish range; repeat round 1 and continue.

Bebiliths are enormous, predatory, arachnid demons that hunt other demons. A bebilith has a body the size of a plow horse, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs more than two tons. 

Bebiliths understand but do not speak Abyssal. Their telepathy allows them to communicate silently with one another. 

#### Combat

A bebilith attacks any creature it sees. It usually picks one target and concentrates its attacks on that opponent, using its webs to isolate the target from its comrades. Should the bebilith become overwhelmed by tougher opponents, it often attempts to bite one or more of its victims and retreats, allowing its poison to do its work. 

A bebilith's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage 2d6 Con. Bebilith venom is highly perishable, losing its potency and becoming inert, foul-smelling goo almost as soon as it comes into contact with air. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Rend Armor (Ex)
If a bebilith hits with both claw attacks, it pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed. Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check. 

#### Web (Ex)
A bebilith can throw a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 30 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet. This attack is effective against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement. 

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 24 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 24 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based. The web has 14 hit points and hardness 0. There is a 75% chance that the webbing will not burn if any sort of fire is applied to it (check each round). 

#### Plane Shift (Su)
This ability affects only the bebilith. It is otherwise similar to the spell (caster level 12th). 

#### Skills
A bebilith has mottled coloration that gives it a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks.

| Organization: | Solitary, pair, gang (3--5), crowd (6--15), or mob (10--40) | 
| Challenge Rating: | 2 |

| Alignment: | Always chaotic evil | 
| Advancement: | 3--6 HD (Small) | 
| Level Adjustment: | +2 | 
A dretch is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds. 

Dretches cannot speak but can communicate telepathically. 

#### Combat

Dretches are slow, stupid, and not very effective combatants. In one-on-one combat, they rely on their damage reduction to keep them alive. In groups, they depend on sheer numbers to overcome foes and immediately summon other dretches to improve the odds in battle. They flee at the first sign of adversity unless more powerful demons are present to intimidate them into fighting. Dretches' fear of their greater kin is stronger then even their fear of death. 

A dretch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **1/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Scare\|Scare]] (DC 12), [[3.5 Spell List#Stinking Cloud\|Stinking Cloud]] (DC 13);
 -  Caster level 2nd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a dretch can attempt to summon another dretch with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. 

#### Telepathy (Su)
Dretches can communicate telepathically with creatures within 100 feet that speak Abyssal.

Like succubi, glabrezu tempt victims into ruin, but they lure their prey with power or wealth rather than passion. 

Glabrezu have penetrating violet eyes, and their skin color ranges from deep russet to pitch black. A glabrezu stands about 15 feet tall and weighs about 5,500 pounds. 

#### Combat

Glabrezu prefer subterfuge to combat. However, if their attempts to entice or deceive fail, these enormous demons attack with a vengeance. They follow a *confusion* attack with melee attacks, hoping to finish off wounded foes with *chaos hammer* or *unholy blight.* 

A glabrezu's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a glabrezu must hit a Medium or smaller opponent with a pincer attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

A hezrou can walk both upright and on all fours, but it always fights standing up 

A hezrou is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 750 pounds. 

#### Combat

Hezrous enjoy melee combat even more than vrocks do. They eagerly press an attack deep into the heart of enemy forces, so their stench can take effect as quickly as possible. They enter most battles by using *blasphemy,* and follow it with an occasional *chaos hammer* or *unholy blight,* depending on the alignment of their opponents. 

A hezrou's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a hezrou must hit with both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities

 - * Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Stench (Ex)
A hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same hezrou's stench for 24 hours. A *delay poison* or *neutralize poison* spell removes either condition from one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a hezrou can attempt to summon 4d10 dretches or another hezrou with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell. 

#### Skills
Hezrous have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

A marilith usually holds a longsword in each of its six hands and wears many bangles and jewels. 

A marilith stands about 9 feet tall and measures about 20 feet from head to tip of tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds. 

#### Combat

Though mariliths thrive on grand strategy and army-level tactics, they love physical combat and never pass up an opportunity to fight. Each of a marilith's six arms can wield a weapon, and the creature gets an additional three weapon attacks with its primary arm. Mariliths seldom rush headlong into battle, however, preferring to hang back and size up the situation first. They always seek to gain the best possible advantage from the local terrain, obstacles, and any vulnerability or weakness in their opponents. 

A marilith's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Constrict (Ex)
A marilith deals 4d6+13 points of damage with a successful grapple check. The constricted creature must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or lose consciousness for as long as it remains in the coils and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Strength-based. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a marilith must hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it succeeds on the grapple check, it can constrict. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities

#### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a marilith can attempt to summon 4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrou, or one nalfeshnee with a 50% chance of success, or one glabrezu or another marilith with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell. 

#### True Seeing (Su)
Mariliths continuously use this ability, as the spell (caster level 16th). 

#### Skills
Mariliths have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. 

#### Feats
In combination with its natural abilities, a marilith's Multiweapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with all its arms at no penalty.

A nalfeshnee can fly despite its small wings. 

A nalfeshnee is more than 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds. 

#### Combat

When fulfilling their duties in the underworld, nalfeshnees usually disdain combat as being beneath them. Given the opportunity, they succumb to blood lust and do battle. They disable opponents with their smite ability and slaughter them while they can't fight back. 

A nalfeshnee's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Smite (Su)
Three times per day a nalfeshnee can create a nimbus of unholy light. When the demon triggers the ability, rainbow-colored beams play around its body. One round later they burst in a 60-foot radius. Any creature within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of its worst fears hound it. The creature receives its full Dexterity and shield bonuses to AC if attacked but can take no actions. Other demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

#### True Seeing (Su)
Nalfeshnees continuously use true seeing, as the spell (caster level 14th).

In its natural form, a quasit stands about 1-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 8 pounds. 

Quasits speak Common and Abyssal. 

#### Combat

Although quasits thirst for victory and power as other demons do, they are cowards at heart. They typically attack from ambush, using their alternate form ability and *invisibility* to get within reach, then try to scuttle away. When retreating, they use their *cause fear* ability to deter pursuit. 

A quasit's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Good\|Detect Good]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Magic\|Detect Magic]] , [[3.5 Spell List#And Invisibility\|And Invisibility]] (self Only);

 -  Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Once per week a quasit can use *commune* to ask six questions. The ability otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).

#### Alternate Form (Su)
A quasit can assume other forms at will as a standard action. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on itself (caster level 12th), except that a quasit does not regain hit points for changing form, and any individual quasit can assume only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include bat, monstrous centipede, toad, and wolf. A quasit in alternate form loses its poison attack.

A retriever specializes in recovering lost or desired objects, runaway slaves, and enemies and bringing them back to its master. A retriever has a body the size of an ox, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs about 6,500 pounds. 

#### Combat

Retrievers attack with four claws, but their eye rays are far more deadly. 

#### Eye Rays (Su)
A retriever's eyes can produce four different magical rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray as a free action. A particular ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. A retriever can fire an eye ray in the same round that it makes physical attacks. The save DC for all rays is 18. The save DC is Dexterity-based. 

The four eye effects are: 

*Fire:* Deals 12d6 points of fire damage to the target (Reflex half ). 

*Cold:* Deals 12d6 points of cold damage to the target (Reflex half ). 

*Electricity:* Deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to the target (Reflex half ). 

*Petrification:* The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or turn to stone permanently. 

#### *Find Target* (Sp)
When ordered to find an item or a creature, a retriever does so unerringly, as though guided by *discern location.* 

The being giving the order must have seen (or must have an item belonging to) the creature to be found, or must have touched the object to be located. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a retriever must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and grips the opponent fast in its mouth. This is the method by which it usually "retrieves" things.

A succubus is 6 feet tall in its natural form and weighs about 125 pounds. 

#### Combat

Succubi are not warriors. They flee combat whenever they can. If forced to fight, they can attack with their claws, but they prefer to turn foes against one another. Succubi use their *polymorph* ability to assume humanoid guise, and can maintain this deception indefinitely. Their preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is to feign friendship and create an opportunity to be alone with one of them, whereupon the succubus applies her life-draining kiss. Succubi are not above taking on the role of a damsel in distress when encountered within a dungeon. 

A succubus's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Energy Drain (Su)
A succubus drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. If the target is not willing to be kissed, the succubus must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. The succubus's kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a *suggestion* spell, asking the victim to accept another kiss from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect of the *suggestion*. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.

A vrock is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds. 

#### Combat

Vrocks are vicious fighters who like to fly down into the enemy and cause as much damage as possible. They prance about in battle, taking briefly to the air and bringing their clawed feet into play. Despite their advantage in mobility, the vrocks' deep love of battle frequently leads them into melee combats against heavy odds. 

A vrock's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Dance of Ruin (Su)
To use this ability, a group of at least three vrocks must join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting. 

At the end of 3 rounds of dancing, a wave of crackling energy flashes outward in a 100-foot radius. All creatures except for demons within the radius take 20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 18 half ). Stunning, paralyzing, or slaying one of the vrocks stops the dance. The save DC is Charisma-based.

 - **1/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Heroism\|Heroism]] ;
 - * Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Spores (Ex)
A vrock can release masses of spores from its body once every 3 rounds as a free action. The spores automatically deal 1d8 points of damage to all creatures adjacent to the vrock. They then penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d4 points of damage each round for 10 rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. (The vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days.) A *delay poison* spell stops the spores' growth for its duration. *Bless, neutralize poison,* or *remove disease* kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water. 

#### Stunning Screech (Su)
Once per hour a vrock can emit a piercing screech. All creatures except for demons within a 30-foot radius must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### *Summon Demon* (Sp)
Once per day a vrock can attempt to summon 2d10 dretches or another vrock with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell. 

#### Skills
Vrocks have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Derro are afflicted by a form of racial madness, which most often manifests as delusions of grandeur coupled with an overpowering urge to inflict torment on other creatures. Derro are capable of holding their murderous impulses in check for short periods of time in order to cooperate with creatures of other races, but such arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of his mind. 

#### Combat

Derro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike savagely from hiding. They delight in taking captives who can be tortured to death later, and favor traps and poisons that disable without killing. 

#### Madness (Ex)
Derro use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and have immunity to *confusion* and *insanity* effects. A derro cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a *miracle* or *wish* spell. 

\*The racial madness of the derro provides a +6 bonus to their Charisma scores and a --6 penalty to their Wisdom scores. A derro restored to sanity gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma. 

#### Poison Use (Ex)
Derro typically carry 2d4 doses of greenblood oil or Medium monstrous spider venom, applying it to their crossbow bolts. Derro are not at risk of poisoning themselves when handling poison. 

#### Sneak Attack (Ex)
Any time a derro's opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a derro flanks his opponent, he deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue's sneak attack and subject to the same limitations. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities

The dungeon-dwelling destrachan looks like some bizarre, nonintelligent beast, but it's an incredibly evil and crafty sadist. A destrachan has a pair of complex, three-part ears that it can adjust to be more or less sensitive to various sounds. It is blind, yet hunts with a sense of hearing more precise than most creatures' sight. 

From its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harmonics, producing sonic energy so powerful it can shatter a stone wall. So skilled is a destrachan at controlling the sounds it emits that it can choose what type of material to affect with its attack. 

A destrachan is about 10 feet long from its mouth to the tip of the tail and weighs about 4,000 pounds. 

A destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If a destrachan must communicate, it does so through action. 

#### Combat

A destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes weakened by its sonic attacks. It often enters battle with surprise if possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and then changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh. 

#### Destructive Harmonics (Su)
A destrachan can blast sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can also use this attack to affect any creatures or objects within a 30-foot radius. It can tune the harmonics of this destructive power to affect different types of targets. All save DCs are Charisma-based. 

*Flesh:* Disrupting tissue and rending bone, this attack deals 4d6 points of damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ). 

*Nerves:* A destrachan can focus its harmonics to knock out foes rather than slay them. This attack deals 6d6 points of nonlethal damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ). 

*Material:* When using this form of harmonics, a destrachan chooses wood, stone, metal, or glass. All objects made of that material within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or shatter. Objects (or portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit points are potentially affected by this attack. 

#### Blindsight (Ex)
A destrachan can use hearing to ascertain all foes within 100 feet as a sighted creature would. 

#### Immunities
Destrachans have immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. 

#### Protection from Sonics (Ex)
While they can be affected by loud noises and sonic spells (such as *ghost sound* or *silence*), destrachans are less vulnerable to sonic attacks (+4 circumstance bonus on all saves) because they can protect their ears. A destrachan whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, and all targets are treated as having total concealment. 

#### Skills
A destrachan has a +10 racial bonus on Listen checks. 

## Devil

Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes. 

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray. 

#### Devil Traits
Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). 

- Immunity to fire and poison.

- Resistance to acid 10 and cold 10.

- See in Darkness (Su): Some devils can see perfectly in darkness of
any kind, even that created by a *deeper darkness* spell. 

- *Summon* (Sp): Some devils share the ability to summon others of
their kind (the success chance and type of devils summoned are noted in each monster description). 

- Telepathy.

Except when otherwise noted, devils speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.

A barbed devil is about 7 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds. 

#### Combat

Barbed devils eagerly fight with their claws, trying to impale their opponents. They use *hold person* to immobilize those who avoid their hug attacks. 

A barbed devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Fear (Su)
A creature hit by a barbed devil must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as though by *fear* (caster level 9th). 

Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by that same barbed devil's fear ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Impale (Ex)
A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a barbed devil must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent on its barbed body. 

#### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Once per day a barbed devil can attempt to summon 1d6 bearded devils or another barbed devil with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell. 

#### Barbed Defense (Su)
Any creature striking a barbed devil with handheld weapons or natural weapons takes 1d8+6 points of piercing and slashing damage from the devil's barbs. Note that weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.

Every bearded devil carries a sawtoothed glaive. 

A bearded devil stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 225 pounds. 

#### Combat

Bearded devils are aggressive and love to fight. They revel in their battle frenzy, spreading mayhem among their foes. 

A bearded devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Teleport, Greater\|Teleport, Greater]] (self Plus 50 Pounds Of Objects Only);
 -  Caster level 12th.

#### Infernal Wound (Su)
The damage a bearded devil deals with its glaive causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 2 additional hit points each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16 Heal check, a *cure* spell, or a *heal* spell. However, a character attempting to cast a *cure* spell or a *heal* spell on a creature damaged by a bearded devil's glaive must succeed on a DC 16 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. 

A successful Heal check automatically stops the continuing hit point loss as well as restoring hit points. The infernal wound is a supernatural ability of the bearded devil, not of the weapon. The check DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Beard (Ex)
If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw attacks, it automatically hits with its beard. The affected creature takes 1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be infected with a vile disease known as devil chills (incubation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). Damage is dealt each day until the afflicted creature succeeds on three consecutive Fortitude saves, the disease is cured magically, or the creature dies. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Battle Frenzy (Ex)
Twice per day, a bearded devil can work itself into a battle frenzy similar to the barbarian's rage (+4 Strength, +4 Constitution, +2 morale bonus on Will saves, --2 AC penalty). The frenzy lasts for 6 rounds, and the bearded devil suffers no ill effects afterward. 

#### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Once per day a bearded devil can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures with a 50% chance of success, or another bearded devil with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

Kytons are humanlike devils, wrapped in chains instead of clothing. A chain devil is 6 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds, chains included. 

Chain devils speak Infernal and Common. 

#### Combat

A chain devil attacks by flailing away with the spiked chains that serve as its clothing, armor, and weapons. 

A chain devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Dancing Chains (Su)
A chain devil's most awesome attack is its ability to control up to four chains within 20 feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, a chain devil can increase these chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as effectively as the devil itself. If a chain is in another creature's possession, the creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the chain devil's power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the creature's possession. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

A chain devil can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making Climb checks. 

#### Unnerving Gaze (Su)
Range 30 ft., Will DC 15 negates. A chain devil can make its face resemble one of an opponent's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. Those who fail their saves take a --2 penalty on attack rolls for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Regeneration (Ex)
Chain devils take normal damage from silvered weapons, good-aligned weapons, and spells or effects with the good descriptor. A chain devil that loses a piece of its body regrows it in 2d6x10 minutes. Holding the severed member against the stump enables it to reattach instantly. 

#### Skills
Chain devils have a +8 racial bonus on Craft checks involving metalwork.

Unlike other devils, erinyes appear attractive to humans, resembling very comely women or men. An erinyes stands about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. 

Erinyes speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic. 

#### Combat

Erinyes prefer to engage in combat from a distance. They use *charm monster* to distract or disorganize their opponents, then rain down fiery arrows from above. 

An erinyes's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Entangle (Ex)

While its appearance suggests it is incorporeal, a hellcats has a corporeal body and can be harmed by physical attacks. 

Hellcats use a natural telepathy to communicate with one another and those they encounter. A hellcat measures about 9 feet long and weighs about 900 pounds. 

#### Combat

A hellcat can hold its own in combat thanks to sharp claws and wicked fangs. It prefers to leap upon opponents, just as a lion does.

#### Improved Grab (Ex)

A horned devil is 9 feet tall and weighs about 600 pounds. 

#### Combat

Horned devils are bold fighters. They rarely retreat, even against overwhelming odds. They love to fight with their spiked chains, usually singling out the most powerful foes to stun and eliminate quickly. 

A horned devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Dispel Chaos\|Dispel Chaos]] (DC 21), [[3.5 Spell List#Dispel Good\|Dispel Good]] (DC 21), [[3.5 Spell List#Magic Circle Against Good\|Magic Circle Against Good]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Teleport, Greater\|Teleport, Greater]] (self Plus 50 Pounds Of Objects Only);

 -  Caster level 15th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Fear Aura (Su)
A horned devil can radiate a 5-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 15th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same horned devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Stun (Su)
Whenever a horned devil hits with a spiked chain attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based. This ability is a function of the horned devil, not of the spiked chain. 

#### Infernal Wound (Su)
The damage a horned devil deals with its tail attack causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 2 additional hit points each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 24 Heal check, a *cure* spell, or a *heal* spell. However, a character attempting to cast a *cure* spell or a *heal* spell on a creature damaged by a horned devil's tail must succeed on a DC 24 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A successful Heal check automatically stops the continuing hit point loss as well as restoring hit points. The check DC is Constitution-based. 

#### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Once per day a horned devil can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures or 1d6 bearded devils with a 50% chance of success, 1d6 barbed devils with a 35% chance of success, or another horned devil with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. 

#### Regeneration (Ex)
A horned devil takes normal damage from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.

An ice devil is about 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds. 

#### Combat

An ice devil prefers to fight only when doing so serves its mission, but it never hesitates to attack when it deems a battle necessary---or likely to end in its victory. 

An ice devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Fear Aura (Su)
An ice devil can radiate a 10-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 13th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ice devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Slow (Su)
A hit from an ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a *slow* spell for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

In its natural form, an imp stands almost 2 feet tall and weighs about 8 pounds. 

#### Combat

Imps are craven, but not so timid as to pass up an opportunity for a surprise attack using their *invisibility* and alternate form ability. In its natural form, an imp attacks with the wicked stinger on its tail. It quickly flies out of reach if a foe manages to strike back effectively. 

An imp's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Good\|Detect Good]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Magic\|Detect Magic]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Invisibility\|Invisibility]] (self Only);
 - **1/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Suggestion\|Suggestion]] (DC 15);
 -  Caster level 6th. The save DC is Charisma-based. Once per week an imp can use *commune* to ask six questions. The ability otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).

#### Alternate Form (Su)
An imp can assume other forms at will as a standard action. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on itself (caster level 12th), except that an imp does not regain hit points for changing form, and an individual imp can assume only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include monstrous spider, raven, rat, and boar.

A lemure is about 5 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. 

Lemures are mindless and cannot communicate, but they are sensitive to telepathic messages from other devils, typically obeying a devil's mental commands. 

#### Combat

Lemures surge toward anything they meet and try to claw it apart. Only a telepathic command from other devils or the complete destruction of the lemures can make them stop. 

A lemure's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Mindless (Ex)
Immunity to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

A pit fiend often wraps its wings around itself like a grotesque cloak, and appears wreathed in flames. 

A pit fiend is 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. 

#### Combat

Pit fiends are wily and resourceful fighters, using *invisibility* to gain the upper hand and biting at foes seemingly able to see them. They don't hesitate to blanket an area with *fireballs*, and can call down the wrath of an inferno with *meteor swarm.* 

A pit fiend's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Constrict (Ex)
A pit fiend deals 2d8+26 points of damage with a successful grapple check. 

#### Disease (Su)
A creature struck by a pit fiend's bite attack must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be infected with a vile disease known as devil chills (incubation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Fear Aura (Su)
A pit fiend can radiate a 20-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 27 Will save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 18th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same pit fiend's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a pit fiend must hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 27, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage death. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Blasphemy\|Blasphemy]] (DC 25), [[3.5 Spell List#Create Undead\|Create Undead]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Fireball\|Fireball]] (DC 21), [[3.5 Spell List#Dispel Magic, Greater\|Dispel Magic, Greater]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Teleport, Greater\|Teleport, Greater]] (self Plus 50 Pounds Of Objects Only), [[3.5 Spell List#Invisibility\|Invisibility]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Magic Circle Against Good\|Magic Circle Against Good]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Hold Monster, Mass\|Hold Monster, Mass]] (DC 27), [[3.5 Spell List#Persistent Image\|Persistent Image]] (DC 23), [[3.5 Spell List#Power Word Stun\|Power Word Stun]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Unholy Aura\|Unholy Aura]] (DC 26);
 - **1/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Meteor Swarm\|Meteor Swarm]] (DC 27);
 -  Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Once per year a pit fiend can use *wish* as the spell (caster level 20th).

#### *Summon Devil* (Sp)
Twice per day a pit fiend can automatically summon 2 lemures, bone devils, or bearded devils, or 1 erinyes, horned devil, or ice devil. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. 

#### Regeneration (Ex)
A pit fiend takes normal damage from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor. 

#### Tactics Round-by-Round

A pit fiend typically opens combat by using its spell-like abilities, attempting to neutralize dangerous opponents before entering melee. 

*Prior to combat: Unholy aura*; activate fear aura, *summon devil*. 

*Round 1:* Quickened *fireball* and *mass hold monster* if facing three or more visible, active opponents; otherwise *power word stun* against unarmored opponent (preferably a spellcaster). 

*Round 2: Meteor swarm* against as many foes as possible, approach worst-injured enemy. 

*Round 3:* Full attack against injured enemy. 

*Round 4:* Continue melee against injured enemy, or *power word stun* against annoying spellcaster. 

*Round 5:* Repeat from round 1, or *greater teleport* to safety if endangered.

Devourers lurk on the Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane, stalking both natives and travelers with equal sadistic glee. 

A devourer is about 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. 

Devourers speak Common. 

#### Combat

Even if it had no special abilities, a devourer would be a terrible opponent, for its bony claws can flay enemies alive. 

#### Energy Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a devourer's claw attack or *spectral hand* ability gain one negative level. The DC is 19 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Trap Essence (Su)
The devourer is named for its ability to consume an enemy's life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee attacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. The he save DC is Charisma-based. A slain creature's essence is trapped within the devourer's ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that victim's features. The trapped essence cannot be raised or resurrected, but a *limited wish, miracle,* or *wish* spell frees it, as does destroying the devourer. A devourer can hold only one essence at a time. 

The trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of the trapped creature. As this energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it evaporates completely. The trapped essence gains one negative level for every five times the devourer uses one of its spell-like abilities. When the essence's number of negative levels equals the creature's total Hit Dice or level, the essence is destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose that level permanently. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **Once per round, a devourer can use one of the following abilities:** [[3.5 Spell List#Confusion\|Confusion]] (DC 17), [[3.5 Spell List#Control Undead\|Control Undead]] (DC 20), [[3.5 Spell List#Ghoul Touch\|Ghoul Touch]] (DC 15), [[3.5 Spell List#Lesser Planar Ally\|Lesser Planar Ally]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Ray Of Enfeeblement\|Ray Of Enfeeblement]] (DC 14), [[3.5 Spell List#Spectral Hand\|Spectral Hand]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Suggestion\|Suggestion]] (DC 16), [[3.5 Spell List#True Seeing\|True Seeing]] ;
 -  Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Spell Deflection (Su)
The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the imprisoned essence instead: *banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnosis, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul,* or any form of charm or compulsion. In many cases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its spell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.

A digester stands about 5 feet tall and is 7 feet long from snout to tail. It weighs about 350 pounds, 

#### Combat

A digester is a hunting and eating machine. When it is not hungry (which is rarely), it lies low and avoids most other creatures. When hunting, it looks about for a likely target, then charges forth and delivers a gout of acid. If the initial attack is insufficient to kill the prey, the digester attacks with its hind feet until it can spray acid again. 

#### Acid Spray (Ex)
A digester can spray acid in a 20-foot cone, dealing 4d8 points of damage to everything in the area. Once a digester uses this ability, it can't use it again until 1d4 rounds later. 

The creature can also produce a concentrated stream of acid that deals 8d8 points of damage to a single target within 5 feet. In either case, a DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Skills
A digester's coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. It also has a +4 racial bonus on Jump checks. 

## Dinosaur

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Bigger varieties have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have more colorful markings. Most dinosaurs have a pebbly skin texture. 

#### Combat

Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The swift carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover until they can get into charge range and rush to the attack. Herbivores frequently overrun and trample their opponents.

A deinonychus is bright green along its back and flanks, with a much lighter shade of the same color on its underside. The body has darker spots or stripes. Its tail extends straight out behind itself, held aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its weight to be carried entirely by the back legs. It weighs about 600 pounds. 

#### Combat

A deinonychus uses a combination of speed, grasping forearms, large teeth, and hind legs with ripping talons. It hunts by running at prey, leaping, and ripping with its rear talons as it claws and bites. The talons count as one attack. A deinonychus has a relatively large brain for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics. 

#### Pounce (Ex)
If a deinonychus charges, it can make a full attack. 

#### Skills
A deinonychus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Jump, Listen, Spot, and Survival checks.

Though it resides primarily in the water, an elasmosaurus only breathes air. An elasmosaurus has a total length of some 30 feet, including a tail half as long as its entire body, and weighs about 5,000 pounds. Observers who see only its head or tail might easily mistake it for a massive snake. 

#### Combat

An elasmosaurus is aggressive and attacks anything it notices. The creature is strong, fast, and highly maneuverable, able to turn quickly and lunge at prey. When hunting, it travels with its head out of the water, snapping down quickly to seize prey.

Despite its enormous size and 6-ton weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner. Its head is nearly 6 feet long, and its teeth are from 3 to 6 inches in length. It is slightly more than 30 feet long from nose to tail. 

#### Combat

A tyrannosaurus pursues and eats just about anything it sees. Its tactics are simple---charge in and bite. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a tyrannosaurus must hit an opponent of up to one size smaller with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round. 

#### Swallow Whole (Ex)
A tyrannosaurus can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of up to two sizes smaller by making a successful grapple check. The swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the tyrannosaurus's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. 

A Huge tyrannosaurus's gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents. 

#### Skills
A tyrannosaurus has a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Doppelgangers are strange beings that are able to take on the shapes of those they encounter. In its natural form, the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed features. The flesh is pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. A doppelganger's appearance is deceiving even when it's in its true form. A doppelganger is hardy, with a natural agility not in keeping with its frail appearance. 

Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived. 

It is natural form a doppelganger is about 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. 

#### Combat

When in its natural form, a doppelganger strikes with its powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such cases, it uses its detect thoughts ability to employ the same tactics and strategies as the person it is impersonating. 

#### Detect Thoughts (Su)
A doppelganger can continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 13 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Change Shape (Su)
A doppelganger can assume the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid. In humanoid form, the doppelganger loses its natural attacks. A doppelganger can remain in its humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but a doppelganger reverts to its natural form when killed. A *true seeing* spell or ability reveals its natural form. 

#### Skills
A doppelganger has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. 

\*When using its change shape ability, a doppelganger gets an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If it can read an opponent's mind, it gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.

## Dragon, True

The known varieties of true dragons (as opposed to other creatures that have the dragon type) fall into two broad categories: chromatic and metallic. The chromatic dragons are black, blue, green, red, and white; they are all evil and extremely fierce. The metallic dragons are brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver; they are all good, usually noble, and highly respected by the wise. 

All true dragons gain more abilities and greater power as they age. (Other creatures that have the dragon type do not.) They range in length from several feet upon hatching to more than 100 feet after attaining the status of great wyrm. The size of a particular dragon varies according to age and variety. 

A dragon's metabolism operates like a highly efficient furnace and can metabolize even inorganic material. Some dragons have developed a taste for such fare. 

Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It's pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. By the time a dragon matures to the age of great wyrm, hundreds of gems and coins may be imbedded in its hide. 

All dragons speak Draconic. 

#### Combat

A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, and can also use a breath weapon and special physical attacks, depending on its size. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with ranged attacks. Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies). 

The table below provides space and reach statistics for dragons of various sizes, plus the natural weapons a dragon of a certain size can employ and the damage those attacks deal. 

#### Bite
Bite attacks deal the indicated damage plus the dragon's Strength bonus. A dragon also can use its bite to snatch opponents if it has the Snatch feat. 

#### Claw
Claw attacks deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). The dragon also can use its claws to snatch opponents if it has the Snatch feat. Claw attacks are secondary attacks, requiring a --5 penalty on the attack roll. (Many dragons choose the Multiattack feat to lessen this penalty to --2). 

#### Wing
The dragon can slam opponents with its wings, even when flying. Wing attacks deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon's Strength bonus (round down) and are treated as secondary attacks. 

#### Tail Slap
The dragon can slap one opponent each round with its tail. A tail slap deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down) and is treated as a secondary attack. 

#### Crush (Ex)
This special attack allows a flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size to land on opponents as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents). 

A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragon's body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. 

A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). 

#### Tail Sweep (Ex)
This special attack allows a dragon of at least Gargantuan size to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon). 

#### Grappling
Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though their crush attack (and Snatch feat, if they know it) use normal grapple rules. A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well as its spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds on Concentration checks. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If a dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at any intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice, with an area as noted on the table below. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragon's age and variety, and is given in each individual entry. Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC; the kind of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Con modifier. 

Breath weapons come in two basic shapes, line and cone, whose areas vary with the dragon's size. 

**Dragon Breath Weapons  ** 

|Dragon Size|Line<sup>*</sup> (Length)|Cone<sup>**</sup> (Length)|
|---|---|---|
|Tiny|30 ft.|15 ft.|
|Small|40 ft.|20 ft.|
|Medium|60 ft.|30 ft.|
|Large|80 ft.|40 ft.|
|Huge|100 ft.|50 ft.|
|Gargantuan|120 ft.|60 ft.|
|Colossal|140 ft.|70 ft.|
|* A line is always 5 feet high and 5 feet wide.|
|** A cone is as high and wide as its length.|

#### Frightful Presence (Ex)
A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet x the dragon's age category are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Cha modifier) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons. 

#### Spells
A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its variety description, gaining bonus spells for a high Charisma score. Some dragons can also cast spells from the cleric list or cleric domain lists as arcane spells. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
A dragon's spell-like abilities depend on its age and variety. It gains the abilities indicated for its age plus all previous ones. Its age category or its sorcerer caster level, whichever is higher, is the caster level for these abilities. The save DC is 10 + dragon's Cha modifier + spell level. All spell-like abilities are usable once per day unless otherwise noted.
#### Damage Reduction
Young adult and older dragons have damage reduction. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Immunities (Ex)
All dragons have immunity to *sleep* and paralysis effects. Each variety of dragon has immunity to one or two additional forms of attack no matter what its age, as given in its description. 

#### Spell Resistance (Ex)
As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the variety descriptions. 

#### Blindsense (Ex)
Dragons can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents the dragon can't actually see still have total concealment against the dragon. 

#### Keen Senses (Ex)
A dragon sees four times as well a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light. It also has darkvision out to 120 feet. 

#### Skills
All dragons have skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (Hit Dice + 3). Most dragons purchase the following skills at the maximum ranks possible: Listen, Search, and Spot. The remaining skill points are generally spent on Concentration, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (any), Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device at a cost of 1 skill point per rank. All these skills are considered class skills for dragons. (Each dragon has other class skills as well, as noted in the variety descriptions.) 

#### Feats
All dragons have one feat, plus additional feats based on Hit Dice just like any other creature. Dragons favor Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Flyby Attack, Hover, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Snatch, Weapon Focus (claw or bite), Wingover, and any metamagic feat that is available and useful to sorcerers. 

|Category|Age (Years)|

|2 Very young|6-15|
|3 Young|16-25|
|4 Juvenile|26-50|
|5 Young adult|51-100|

|Colossal|30 ft./20 ft. (30 ft. with bite)|4d8|4d6|2d8|4d6|4d8|2d8|
|* A dragon's bite attack has reach as if the creature were one size category larger. All other attacks are made with the standard reach for the dragon's size.|

#### Dragon Overland Movement

Chromatic and metallic dragons are exceedingly strong flyers and can cover vast distances quickly. A dragon's overland flying speed is a function of its tactical fly speed, as shown on the table below. 

**Dragon's Fly Speed** 

| |100 feet|150 feet|200 feet|250 feet|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|One Hour||
|Normal|15 miles|20 miles|30 miles|40 miles|
|Hustle|24 miles|40 miles|60 miles|80 miles|
|One Day||
|Normal|120 miles|160 miles|240 miles|320 miles|


Dragons do not tire as quickly as other creatures when moving overland on the ground. If a dragon attempts a hustle or a forced march, check for nonlethal damage once every 2 hours instead of every hour. 

#### Dragonhide

Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or shields of masterwork quality. 

### Chromatic Dragons

Chromatic dragons form the evil branch of dragonkind. They are aggressive, greedy, vain, and nasty. 

#### Black Dragon

##### Environment
Warm marshes 

##### Organization
Wyrmling, very young, young, juvenile, and young adult: solitary or clutch (2--5); adult, mature adult, old, very old, ancient, wyrm, or great wyrm: solitary, pair, or family (1--2 and 2--5 offspring)

Black dragon are sometimes known as skull dragons because of their skeletal faces. Adding to the skeletal impression is the gradual deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn and the cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and does not harm the dragon. On hatching, a black dragon's scales are thin, small, and glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and duller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes. 

Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins before killing them. 

##### Combat

Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. 

##### Breath Weapon (Su)
A black dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of acid. 

##### Water Breathing (Ex)
A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged. 

##### *Corrupt Water* (Sp)
Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, making it become still, foul, and unable to support animal life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence) or become fouled. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. 

##### *Charm Reptiles* (Sp)
A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a *mass charm* spell that affects only reptilian animals. The dragon can communicate with any charmed reptiles as though casting a *speak with animals* spell. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. 

##### Other Spell-Like Abilities
 - **1/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Plant Growth\|Plant Growth]] (old Or Older);
 - **3/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Darkness\|Darkness]] (juvenile Or Older;

##### Skills
Hide, Move Silently, and Swim are considered class skills for black dragons.

A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing desert sands. The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed. 

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage. 

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems---especially sapphires. 

#### Combat

Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as *hallucinatory terrain*, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning. 

#### *Create/Destroy Water* (Sp)
A blue dragon of any age can use this ability three times per day. It works like the *create water* spell, except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead of creating it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence) or be ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. 

#### Sound Imitation (Ex)
A juvenile or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence) to detect the ruse.

A wyrmling green dragon's scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings. 

#### Combat

Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes its presence known quickly---it enjoys 

evoking terror. Sometimes the dragon elects to control a humanoid creature through intimidation and *suggestion.* Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A green dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of corrosive (acid) gas. 

#### Water Breathing (Ex)
A green dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

The small scales of a wyrmling red dragon are a bright glossy scarlet, making the dragon easily spotted by predators and hunters, so it stays underground and does not venture outside until it is more able to take care of itself. Toward the end of young age, the scales turn a deeper red, and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dull finish. As the dragon grows older, the scales become large, thick, and as strong as metal. The neck frill and wings are an ash blue or purple-gray toward the edges, becoming darker with age. The pupils of a red dragon fade as it ages; the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs. 

#### Combat

Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time. A red dragon lands to attack small, weak creatures with its claws and bite rather than obliterating them with its breath weapon, so as not to destroy any treasure they might be carrying. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A red dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of fire. 

#### *Locate Object* (Sp)
A juvenile or older red dragon can use this ability as the spell of the same name, once per day per age category.

The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten like mirrors. As the dragon ages, the sheen disappears, and by very old age, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed in with the white. 

#### Combat

White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose their breath weapon, then try to knock out a single opponent with a follow-up attack. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A white dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of cold. 

#### Icewalking (Ex)
This ability works like the *spider climb* spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. It is always in effect. 

#### *Freezing Fog* (Sp)
An old or older white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to a *solid fog* spell but also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a *grease* spell. The dragon is immune to the *grease* effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.

#### Skills
Hide, Move Silently, and Swim are considered class skills for white dragons.

At birth, a brass dragon's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy until they reach a warm, burnished appearance. The grand head-plates of a brass dragon are smooth and metallic, and it sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper with age. Wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As the dragon grows older, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble molten metal orbs. 

#### Combat

Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to leave without engaging in conversation, the dragon might force compliance in a fit of pique, using *suggestion* or a dose of *sleep* gas. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itself pinned or buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked. When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing into the sand. Older dragons spurn this ploy but still prefer to have the advantage in combat. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire and a cone of *sleep*. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep, regardless of HD, for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

#### *Summon Djinni* (Sp)
This ability, usable by a great wyrm brass dragon, works like a *summon monster* spell, except that it summons one djinni. This ability is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell.

A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green, showing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers, they have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its eyes fade as a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs. 

#### Combat

Bronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food) or force them away magically. They use *detect thoughts* to learn intelligent creatures' intentions. 

When attacking they blind their opponents with *fog cloud* and then charge or, if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring opponents they conjure up a storm or use their tails to smash the vessels' hulls. If a dragon is inclined to be lenient, ships might be merely becalmed, fogbound, or broken-masted. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning and a cone of *repulsion* gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment effect. 

#### Water Breathing (Ex)
A bronze dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged. 

#### Alternate Form (Su)
A young or older bronze dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.

At birth, a copper dragon's scales have a ruddy brown color with a metallic tint. As the dragon gets older, the scales become finer and more coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss by young adult age. Very old dragons' scales pick up a green tint. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of great wyrms resemble glowing turquoise orbs. 

#### Combat

A copper dragon appreciates wit and usually doesn't harm creatures that can relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon has not heard before. It quickly gets annoyed with anyone who doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor. It likes to taunt and annoy opponents into giving up or acting foolishly. 

An angry copper dragon prefers to mire foes using *transmute rock to mud*. The dragon pushes trapped opponents into the mud or snatches and carries them aloft. A copper dragon tries to draw airborne enemies into narrow, stony gorges where it can use its spider climb ability and maneuver them into colliding with the walls. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A copper dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of acid and a cone of *slow* gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or be slowed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon. 

#### Spider Climb (Ex)
A copper dragon can climb on stone surfaces as though using the *spider climb* spell.

On hatching, a gold dragon's scales are dark yellow with golden metallic flecks. 

The flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult stage, the scales are completely golden. Gold dragons' faces are bewhiskered and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools of molten gold. 

#### Combat

Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing with intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive to gain the upper hand. In combat, they employ *bless* and their *luck bonus;* older dragons use their *luck bonus* at the start of each day. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are *cloudkill, delayed blast fireball, fire shield, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow,* and *stinking cloud.* 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A gold dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of fire and a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within a cone of weakening gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category of the dragon. 

#### Alternate Form (Su)
A gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form. 

#### Water Breathing (Ex)
A gold dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged (the cone of fire becomes a cone of superheated steam underwater). 

#### *Luck Bonus* (Sp)
Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature in a 10-foot radius per age category of the dragon receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and similar rolls, as for a *stone of good luck*. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon but ends if the gem is destroyed. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. 

#### *Detect Gems* (Sp)
An old or older gold dragon can use this ability three times per day. This is a divination effect similar to a *detect magic* spell, except that it finds only gems. The dragon can scan a 60-degree arc each round: By concentrating for 1 round it knows if there are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of concentration reveal the exact number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their exact location, type, and value. This ability is the equivalent of a 2ndlevel spell.

A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until the individual scales are scarcely visible. 

#### Combat

Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use *fog cloud* or *control weather* to blind or confuse opponents before attacking. When angry, they use *reverse gravity* to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. Against flying opponents, a silver dragon hides in clouds (creating some with *control weather* on clear days), then jumps to the attack when it has the advantage. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A silver dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of cold and a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures within a cone of paralyzing gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon. 

#### Alternate Form (Su)
A silver dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an anirmal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form. 

#### Cloudwalking (Su)
A silver dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground. The ability functions continuously but can be negated or resumed at will.

A dragonne possesses huge claws and fangs, and large eyes, usually the color of its scales. A dragonne is about 12 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds. 

Dragonnes speak Draconic. 

#### Combat

A dragonne's wings are useful only for short flights, carrying the creature for 10 to 30 minutes at a time. Nevertheless, it uses its wings effectively in battle. If opponents attempt to charge or encircle it, the dragonne simply takes to the air and finds a more defensible position. 

#### Pounce (Ex)
If a dragonne charges, it can make a full attack in the same round. 

#### Roar (Su)
A dragonne can loose a devastating roar every 1d4 rounds. All creatures except dragonnes within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become fatigued. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves become exhausted. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Skills
Dragonnes have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. 

#### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a dragonne is up to 348 pounds; a medium load, 349--699 pounds, and a heavy load, 700--1,050 pounds.

A dryad's delicate features are much like a female elf 's, though her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons. 

Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions. 

Dryads speak Common, Elven, and Sylvan. 

#### Combat

Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are alluring---they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad uses *charm person* or *suggestion,* attempting to gain control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.

 -  Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.

#### Tree Dependent (Su)
Each dryad is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad's oak does not radiate magic. 

#### Wild Empathy (Ex)
This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that the dryad has a +6 racial bonus on the check.

Dwarves favor earth tones in their clothing and prefer simple and functional garb. The skin can be very dark, but it is always some shade of tan or brown. Hair color can be black, gray, or brown. Dwarves average 4 feet tall and weigh as much as adult humans. 

Dwarves speak Dwarven. Most who travel outside dwarven lands (as traders, mercenaries, or adventurers) know the Common tongue, while warriors in the dwarven cities usually learn Goblin to better interrogate and spy on those evil denizens of the deep caves. 

Most dwarves encountered outside their home are warriors. 

#### Combat

Dwarves are experts in combat, effectively using their environment and executing well-planned group attacks. They rarely use magic in fights, since they have few wizards or sorcerers (but dwarven clerics throw themselves into battle as heartily as their fellow warriors). If they have time to prepare, they may build deadfalls or other traps involving stone. In addition to the dwarven waraxe and thrown hammer, dwarves also use warhammers, picks, shortbows, heavy crossbows, and maces. 

#### Dwarf Traits (Ex)
Dwarves possess the following racial traits. 

-  +2 Constitution, --2 Charisma.

- Medium size.

- A dwarf 's base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at
this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. 

- Darkvision out to to 60 feet.

- Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search
checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Dwarves have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground homes. 

- Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven
urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons. 

- Stability: Dwarves are exceptionally stable on their feet. A dwarf
has a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground). 

-  +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. \*Not reflected in
the saving throw numbers given here. 

-  +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like
effects. \*Not reflected in the saving throw numbers given here. 

-  +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs (including halforcs)
and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears). 

-  +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type
(such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants). 

-  +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or
metal items. 

-  +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.

- Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome,
Goblin, Orc, Terran, Undercommon. 

- Favored Class: Fighter.

The dwarf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8. 

### Subraces

The information above is for hill dwarves, the most common variety. 

There are three other major dwarven subraces, which differ from hill dwarves as follows. 

### Deep Dwarf

These dwarves live far underground and tend to be more standoffish with non-dwarves. 

Deep dwarves are the same height as other dwarves, but leaner. Their skin sometimes has a reddish tinge, and their large eyes lack the brightness of those of their kindred, being a washed-out blue. Their hair color ranges from bright red to straw blond. They have little contact with surface dwellers, relying on hill dwarves or mountain dwarves to trade goods for them. 

Deep dwarves speak Dwarven and Goblin, and occasionally Draconic or Undercommon. 

#### Deep Dwarf Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the hill dwarf traits, except where noted. 

- Racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities
increases to +3. 

- Racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poisons increases to +3.

- Darkvision out to 90 feet.

- Light Sensitivity: Deep dwarves are dazzled in bright sunlight or
within the radius of a *daylight* spell. 

#### Duergar

Sometimes called gray dwarves, these evil beings dwell in the underground. 

Most duergar are bald (even the females), and they dress in drab clothing that is designed to blend into stone. In their lairs they may wear jewelry, but it is always kept dull. They war with other dwarves, even allying with other underground creatures from time to time. 

Duergar speak Dwarven and Undercommon. 

### Duergar Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the hill dwarf traits, except where noted. 

-  --4 Charisma instead of --2.

- Darkvision out to 120 feet.

- Immunity to paralysis, phantasms, and poison. This trait replaces the
hill dwarf 's +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. 

-  +2 racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities.

- Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day---*enlarge person* and *invisibility* as
a wizard of twice the duergar's class level (minimum caster level 3rd); these abilities affect only the duergar and whatever it carries. 

- Light Sensitivity: Duergar are dazzled in bright sunlight or within
the radius of a *daylight* spell. 

-  +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

-  +1 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

- Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven, Undercommon.

Bonus Languages: Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran. This trait replaces the hill dwarf 's automatic and bonus languages. 

- Favored Class: Fighter.

- Level adjustment +1

- Unlike other dwarves, duergar do not have weapon familiarity with the
dwarven waraxe and dwarven urgrosh. 

The duergar warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8. 

#### Challenge Rating
Duergar with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to their character level. Duergar with levels in PC classes have a CR equal to their character level +1. 

#### Mountain Dwarf

Mountain dwarves live deeper under the mountains than hill dwarves but generally not as far underground as deep dwarves. They average about 4-1/2 feet tall and have lighter skin and hair than hill dwarves, but the same general appearance.
