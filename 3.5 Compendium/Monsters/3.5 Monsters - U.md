A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard. 

A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. 

Unicorns speak Sylvan and Common. 

#### Combat

Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn. 

### Magic Circle against Evil (Su)
This ability continuously duplicates the effect of the spell. A unicorn cannot suppress this ability. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
Unicorns can use *detect evil* at will as a free action. Once per day a unicorn can use *greater teleport* to move anywhere within its home. It cannot teleport beyond the forest boundaries nor back from outside. A unicorn can use *cure light wounds* three times per day and *cure moderate wounds* once per day (caster level 5th) by touching a wounded creature with its horn. Once per day it can use *neutralize poison* (DC 21, caster level 8th) with a touch of its horn. The save DC is Charisma-based.
#### Wild Empathy (Ex)
This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that a unicorn has a +6 racial bonus on the check. 

#### Skills
Unicorns have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks. \*Unicorns have a +3 competence bonus on Survival checks within the boundaries of their forest. 

### Celestial Charger

The celestial charger described here is an 8 HD celestial unicorn with seven levels of cleric. 

#### Combat

The save DC for this celestial charger's *neutralize poison* ability (DC 20) is adjusted for its greater Hit Dice and altered Charisma score. 

A celestial charger's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Smite Evil (Su)
Once per day a celestial charger can make a normal melee attack to deal 15 points of extra damage against an evil foe.
