# MONSTERS C

**[[3.5 Monsters - B|Previous: Monsters B.]]

## Celestial Creature

Celestial creatures dwell on the upper planes, the realms of good, although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more regal and more beautiful than their earthly counterparts. 

Celestial creatures often come in metallic colors (usually silver, gold, or platinum). They can be mistaken for half-celestials, more powerful creatures that are created when a celestial mates with a non-celestial creature. 

### Creating a Celestial Creature

"Celestial" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal animal, aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, plant, or vermin of good or neutral alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature). 

A celestial creature uses all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes. 

#### Size and Type
Animals or vermin with this template become magical beasts, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged. Celestial creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the extraplanar subtype. 

#### Special Attacks
A celestial creature retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following attack. 

*Smite Evil (Su):* Once per day a celestial creature can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against an evil foe. 

#### Special Qualities
A celestial creature retains all the special qualities of the base creature and also gains the following qualities. 

- Darkvision out to 60 feet.

- Damage reduction (see the table below).

- Resistance to acid, cold, and electricity (see the table below).

- Spell resistance equal to HD + 5 (maximum 25).

|Hit Dice|Resistance to Acid, Cold, Electricity|Damage Reduction|
|---|---|---|
|1-3|5|-|
|4-7|5|5/magic|
|8-11|10|5/magic|
|12 or more|10|10/magic|

If the base creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value. 

If a celestial creature gains damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Abilities
Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least 3. 

#### Environment
Any good-aligned plane. 

#### Challenge Rating
HD 3 or less, as base creature; HD 4 to 7, as base creature +1; HD 8 or more, as base creature +2. 

#### Alignment
Always good (any). 

#### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +2.

The horrific creatures known as chaos beasts have mutable, ever-changing forms. A chaos beast's dimensions vary, but it always weighs about 200 pounds. 

Chaos beasts do not speak. 

#### Combat

For all its fearsome appearances, whether it has claws, fangs, pincers, tentacles, or spines, a chaos beast does little physical harm. Regardless of form, the creature seems unable to manage more than two attacks per round. Its continual transmutations prevent the coordination needed to do more. 

A chaos beast's claw attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Corporeal Instability (Su)
A blow from a chaos beast against a living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried---armor, backpacks, even shirts---hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (--4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). 

Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast. 

A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful. 

Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to remove. A *shapechange* or *stoneskin* spell does not cure an afflicted creature but fixes its form for the duration of the spell. A *restoration, heal,* or *greater restoration* spell removes the affliction (a separate *restoration* is necessary to restore any drained points of Wisdom). 

#### Immunity to Transformation (Ex)
No mortal magic can permanently affect or fix a chaos beast's form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into a new shape, but at the start of its next turn it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free action.

A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera's dragon head might be black, blue, green, red, or white. 

Chimeras can speak Draconic but seldom bother to do so, except when toadying to more powerful creatures. 

#### Combat

The chimera prefers to surprise prey. It often swoops down from the sky or lies concealed until it charges. The dragon head can loose a breath weapon instead of biting. Several chimeras attack in concert. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A chimera's breath weapon depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a chimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 17 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

To determine a chimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below. 

|1d10|Head Color|Breath Weapon|
|---|---|---|
|1-2|Black|40-foot line of acid|
|3-4|Blue|40-foot line of lightning|
|5-6|Green|20-foot cone of gas (acid)|
|7-8|Red|20-foot cone of fire|
|9-10|White|20-foot cone of cold|

#### Skills
A chimera's three heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. 

\*In areas of scrubland or brush, a chimera gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. 

#### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a chimera is up to 348 pounds; a medium load, 349--699 pounds, and a heavy load, 700--1,050 pounds.

These vicious little predators lurk underground, grabbing whatever prey happens by. Its hands and feet have spiny pads that help the choker grip almost any surface. The creature weighs about 35 pounds. 

Chokers speak Undercommon. 

#### Combat

A choker likes to perch near the ceiling, often at intersections, archways, wells, or staircases, and reach down to attack its prey. A choker attacks creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of its size or larger. If one is very hungry, it may attack a group, but it waits to grab the last creature in line. 

#### Constrict (Ex)
A choker deals 1d3+3 points of damage with a successful grapple check against a Large or smaller creature. Because it seizes its victim by the neck, a creature in the choker's grasp cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a choker must hit a Large or smaller opponent with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. Chokers receive a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks, which is already included in the statistics block. 

#### Quickness (Su)
Although not particularly dexterous, a choker is supernaturally quick. It can take an extra standard action or move action during its turn each round. 

#### Skills
A chokers has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. 

## Chuul

A horrible mix of crustacean, insect, and serpent, the chuul is an abomination that lurks submerged or partially submerged, awaiting intelligent prey to devour. Although amphibious, chuuls are not good swimmers and actually prefer to be on land or in very shallow water when they attack. A chuul is about 8 feet long and weighs 650 pounds. 

Chuuls speak Common (or Undercommon, for the underground variety). 

#### Combat

A chuul prefers to wait by the shore, submerged in murky water, until it hears nearby prey (in or out of the water) that it can attack with surprise. A chuul grabs with its claws and constricts its foe, then passes the opponent to its paralytic tentacles. It tries to always have one claw free, so if it faces a large number of opponents, it drops a paralyzed or dead victim and continues attempting to grab, constrict, and paralyze the rest. 

#### Constrict (Ex)
On a successful grapple check, a chuul deals 3d6+5 points of damage. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a chuul must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict or on its next turn transfer a grabbed opponent to its tentacles. 

#### Paralytic Tentacles (Ex)
A chuul can transfer grabbed victims from a claw to its ten- tacles as a move action. The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw but deal no damage. However, they exude a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each round on the chuul's turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes 1d8+2 points of damage each round from the creature's mandibles. 

#### Amphibious (Ex)
Although chuuls are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land. 

#### Skills
A chuul has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. 

## Cloaker



|  | Large Aberration | 
|---|---|
| Hit Dice: | 6d8+18 (45 hp) | 
| Initiative: | +7 | 
| Speed: | 10 ft. (2 squares), fly 40 ft. (average) |

When resting or lying in wait, these creatures are almost impossible to distinguish from common black cloaks (the cloaker's ivory claws look very much like bone clasps). Only when it unfurls does the horrific nature of the creature become apparent. 

A cloaker has a wingspan of about 8 feet. It weighs about 100 pounds. 

Cloakers speak Undercommon. 

#### Combat

Cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for prey. If facing a single opponent, a cloaker uses its engulf attack. Against multiple foes, it lashes with its tail in concert with its moan and shadow shift abilities to reduce the opposition's numbers, then engulfs a survivor. Multiple cloakers usually split up, leaving one or two behind to use special abilities while the rest make melee attacks. 

#### Moan (Ex)
A cloaker can emit a dangerous subsonic moan as a standard action. By changing the frequency, the cloaker can cause one of four effects. Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mindaffecting attacks. Unless otherwise specified, a creature that successfully saves against one of these effects cannot be affected by the same moan effect from the same cloaker for 24 hours. All save DCs for moan effects are Charisma-based. 

*Unnerve:* Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a --2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced to hear the moan for more than 6 consecutive rounds must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or enter a trance, unable to attack or defend themselves until the moaning stops. 

*Fear:* Anyone within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 2 rounds. 

*Nausea:* Anyone in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be overcome by nausea and weakness. 

Affected characters fall prone and become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. 

*Stupor:* A single creature within 30 feet of the cloaker must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a *hold monster* spell for 5 rounds. Even after a successful save, the creature must repeat the save if the cloaker uses this effect again. 

#### Engulf (Ex)
A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a standard action. The cloaker attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still use its whiplike tail to strike at other targets. 

Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. 

#### Shadow Shift (Su)
A cloaker can manipulate shadows. This ability is effective only in shadowy areas and has three possible effects. 

*Obscure Vision:* The cloaker gains concealment (20% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds. 

*Dancing Images:* This effect duplicates a *mirror image* spell (caster level 6th). 

*Silent Image:* This effect duplicates a *silent image* spell (DC 15, caster level 6th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

A male cockatrice has wattles and a comb, just like a rooster. Females, much rarer than males, differ only in that they have no wattles or comb. A cockatrice weighs about 25 pounds. 

#### Combat

A cockatrice fiercely attacks anything that it deems a threat to itself or its lair. Flocks of cockatrices do their utmost to overwhelm and confuse their foes, and sometimes fly directly into their opponents' faces. 

#### Petrification (Su)
Creatures hit by a cockatrice's bite attack must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or instantly turn to stone. The save DC is Constitution-based. Cockatrices have immunity to the petrification ability of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally.

A couatl is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of about 15 feet. It weighs about 1,800 pounds. 

Couatls speak Celestial, Common, and Draconic, and also have the power of telepathy (see below). 

#### Combat

A couatl uses its *detect thoughts* ability on any creature that arouses its suspicions. Since it is highly intelligent, a couatl usually casts spells from a distance before closing. If more than one couatl is involved, they discuss their strategy before a battle. 

#### Constrict (Ex)
A couatl deals 2d8+6 points of damage with a successful grapple check. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a couatl must hit a creature of up to two size categories larger with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial damage 2d4 Str, secondary damage 4d4 Str. 

The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Psionics (Sp)
At will---*detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect thoughts* (DC 15), *invisibility, plane shift* (DC 20), *polymorph* (self only). Effective caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based. 

#### Spells
A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer. 

It can choose its spells known from the sorcerer list, the cleric list, and from the lists for the Air, Good, and Law domains. The cleric spells and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.

#### Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
This ability works like the *ethereal jaunt* spell (caster level 16th). 

#### Telepathy (Su)
A couatl can communicate telepathically with any creature within 90 feet that has an Intelligence score. The creature can respond to the couatl if it wishes---no common language is needed. --- lang: en title: v3.5 SRD / Monsters / Monsters (D-De) ---
