A yeth hound stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 400 pounds. 

Yeth hounds cannot speak, but understand Infernal. 

#### Combat

Yeth hounds hunt only at night. They fear the sun and never venture out in daylight, even if their lives depend on it. 

A yeth hound's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Bay (Su)
When a yeth hound howls or barks, all creatures except other evil outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same hound's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Trip (Ex)
A yeth hound that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the yeth hound. 

#### Flight (Su)
A yeth hound can cease or resume flight as a free action. 

#### Skills
\*A yeth hound has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

A yrthak is blind. It senses sound and movement by means of a special organ on its long tongue. It emits powerfully focused beams of sound from the protrusion on its head. The creature is a yellowish-green color, with the wings and fin being more yellow and the head and body more green. The teeth are yellow. 

A yrthak is about 20 feet long, with a wingspan of 40 feet. It weighs about 5,000 pounds. 

Despite their intelligence, yrthaks do not speak. 

#### Combat

A yrthak prefers to attack from the air, strafing the ground with sonic attacks or snatching up and dropping prey. 

#### Sonic Lance (Su)
Once every 2 rounds, a yrthak can focus sonic energy in a ray up to 60 feet long. This is a ranged touch attack that deals 6d6 points of damage to a single target. 

#### Explosion (Su)
A yrthak can fire its sonic lance at the ground, a large rock, a stone wall, or the like to create an explosion of shattered stone. This attack deals 2d6 points of piercing damage to all within 10 feet of the effect's center. This counts as a use of the sonic lance attack and thus is usable only once every 2 rounds, and never on the round following a sonic lance attack. 

#### Blindsight (Ex)
A yrthak can ascertain all foes within 120 feet. Beyond that range it is considered blinded. Yrthaks are invulnerable to gaze attacks, visual effects of spells such as illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. A yrthak whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, treating all targets as having total concealment. 

#### Immunities
Yrthaks have immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. 

#### Skills
Yrthaks have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.
