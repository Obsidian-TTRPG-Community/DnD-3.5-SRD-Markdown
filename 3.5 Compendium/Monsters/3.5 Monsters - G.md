Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving and use this disguise to surprise their foes. They require no food, water, or air, but often eat their fallen foes out of fondness for inflicting pain. 

Gargoyles speak Common and Terran. 

#### Combat

Gargoyles either remain still, then suddenly attack, or dive onto their prey. 

A gargoyle's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

## Genie

Genies are humanlike beings who dwell on the elemental planes. They are famous for their strength, guile, and skill with illusion magic. 

#### Combat

Genies prefer to outmaneuver and outthink their foes. They are not too proud to flee if it means they'll live to fight another day. If trapped, they bargain, offering treasure or favors in return for their lives and freedom. 

#### *Plane Shift* (Sp)
A genie can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the genie and up to eight other creatures, provided they all link hands with the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level 13th).

The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Elemental Plane of Air. 

A djinni is about 10-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds. 

Djinn speak Auran, Celestial, Common, and Ignan. 

#### Combat

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow. 

#### Air Mastery (Ex)
Airborne creatures take a --1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a djinni. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Invisibility\|Invisibility]] (self Only);
 - **1/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Create Food And Water\|Create Food And Water]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Create Wine\|Create Wine]] (as Create Water, [[3.5 Spell List#But Wine Instead)\|But Wine Instead)]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Major Creation\|Major Creation]] (created Vegetable Matter Is Permanent), [[3.5 Spell List#Persistent Image\|Persistent Image]] (DC 17), [[3.5 Spell List#Wind Walk\|Wind Walk]] ;
 - * Once per day, a djinni can assume *gaseous form* (as the spell) for up to 1 hour. Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Whirlwind (Su)
A djinni can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 7 rounds. In this form, it can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed. 

The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top and up to 50 feet tall. The djinni controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. 

A djinni's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the djinni enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the djinni moves into or through the creature's space. 

Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the djinni might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 20 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 1d8 points of damage each round. A creature with a fly speed is allowed a DC 20 Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +3 racial adjustment. 

Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the djinni carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a --4 penalty to Dexterity and a --2 penalty on attack rolls. The djinni can have only as many trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume. 

The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. 

If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the djinni and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. 

Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. 

A djinni in whirlwind form cannot make melee attacks and does not threaten the area around it. 

#### Noble Djinn

Some djinn (1% of the total population) are noble. A noble djinni can grant three *wishes* to any being (nongenies only) who captures it. Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the third *wish,* are free of their servitude. Noble djinn are as strong as efreet (see below), with 10 Hit Dice.

The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Elemental Plane of Fire. 

An efreeti stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. 

Efreet speak Auran, Common, Ignan, and Infernal. 

#### Combat

Efreet love to mislead, befuddle, and confuse their foes. They do so for enjoyment as well as a battle tactic. 

#### *Change Size* (Sp)
Twice per day, an efreeti can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an *enlarge person* or *reduce person* spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. 

#### Heat (Ex)
An efreeti's red-hot body deals 1d6 points of extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains a hold when grappling. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities

The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. 

Jann speak Common, one elemental language (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran) and one alignment language (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal). 

#### Combat

Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. If they meet a foe they cannot defeat in a standup fight, they use flight and *invisibility* to regroup and maneuver to a more advantageous position. 

#### *Change Size* (Sp)
Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an *enlarge person* or *reduce person* spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **3/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Invisibility\|Invisibility]] (self Only), [[3.5 Spell List#Speak With Animals\|Speak With Animals]] ;
 - * Caster level 12th. Once per day a janni can *create food and water* (caster level 7th) and can use *ethereal jaunt* (caster level 12th) for 1 hour. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Elemental Endurance (Ex)
Jann can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane. 

#### Jann as Characters

Janni characters possess the following racial traits. 

-  +6 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +4
Wisdom, +2 Charisma. 

- Medium size.

- A janni's base land speed is 30 feet. It also has a fly speed of 20
feet (perfect).

provide 6d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +6, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +5, Ref +5, and Will +5. 

- Racial Skills: A janni's outsider levels give it skill points equal
to 9 x (8 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Appraise, Concentration, Craft (any), Escape Artist, Listen, Move Silently, Ride, Sense Motive, and Spot.

receives Improved Initiative as a bonus feat.

A ghaele can take the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch colors, 5 feet in diameter. A ghaele is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds. 

Ghaeles speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their *tongues* ability. 

#### Combat

Ghaeles who enter combat prefer direct confrontation and damaging attacks to more subtle or insidious methods. They usually fight in their humanoid form, wielding incandescent *+4 holy greatswords.* If a ghaele desires mobility, it assumes its globe form and blasts the enemy with light rays. 

A ghaele's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

#### Gaze (Su)
In humanoid form---slay evil creatures of 5 or less HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a *fear* spell for 2d10 rounds. Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer the *fear* effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based. 

#### Light Ray (Ex)
A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type. 

#### Alternate Form (Su)
A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form. 

A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any particular form when killed. A *true seeing* spell or ability, however, reveals both forms simultaneously. 

#### Protective Aura (Su)
Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a *magic circle against evil* effect and a *lesser globe of invulnerability,* both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals ghaele's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a ghaele's statistics block.) 

#### Tongues (Su)
Ghaeles can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a *tongues* spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active. 

## Ghost

Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. 

A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases the spiritual form is somewhat altered. 

### Creating a Ghost

"Ghost" is an acquired template that can be added to any aberration, animal, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or plant. The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6. 

A ghost uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. 

#### Size and Type
The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged. 

#### Hit Dice
All current and future Hit Dice become d12s. 

#### Speed
Ghosts have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability. 

#### Armor Class
Natural armor is the same as the base creature's but applies only to ethereal encounters. When the ghost manifests (see below), its natural armor bonus is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher. 

#### Attack
A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal. 

#### Full Attack
A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal. 

#### Damage
Against ethereal creatures, a ghost uses the base creature's damage values. Against nonethereal creatures, the ghost usually cannot deal physical damage at all but can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests (see below). 

#### Special Attacks
A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect nonethereal creatures. The ghost also gains a manifestation ability plus one to three other special attacks as described below. The save DC against a special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost's HD + ghost's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. 

*Corrupting Gaze (Su):* A ghost can blast living beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost's gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage. 

*Corrupting Touch (Su):* A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only. 

*Draining Touch (Su):* A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only. 

*Frightful Moan (Su):* A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours. 

*Horrific Appearance (Su):* Any living creature within 60 feet that views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same ghost's horrific appearance for 24 hours. 

*Malevolence (Su):* Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a *magic jar* spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost's Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target's body. 

*Manifestation (Su):* Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane. 

When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghost's touch spells don't work on nonethereal targets. 

A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes. 

*Telekinesis (Su):* A ghost can use *telekinesis* as a standard action (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher). When a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again. 

#### Special Qualities
A ghost has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below. 

*Rejuvenation (Su):* In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research. 

*Turn Resistance (Ex):* A ghost has +4 turn resistance. 

#### Abilities
Same as the base creature, except that the ghost has no Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases by +4. 

#### Skills
Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature. 

#### Environment
Any, often as base creature. 

#### Organization
Solitary, gang (2--4), or mob (7--12). 

#### Challenge Rating
Same as the base creature +2. 

#### Treasure
None. 

#### Alignment
Any. 

#### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +5. 

#### Ghostly Equipment

When a ghost forms, all its equipment and carried items usually become ethereal along with it. In addition, the ghost retains 2d4 items that it particularly valued in life (provided they are not in another creature's possession). The equipment works normally on the Ethereal Plane but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures when the ghost manifests, but any such attack has a 50% chance to fail unless the weapon is a ghost touch weapon (just as magic weapons can fail to harm the ghost). 

The original material items remain behind, just as the ghost's physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the ethereal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place.

Ghouls speak the languages they spoke in life (usually Common). 

#### Combat

Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever possible. They strike from behind tombstones and burst from shallow graves. 

#### Ghoul Fever (Su)
Disease---bite, Fortitude DC 12, incubation period 1 day, damage 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast, not a ghoul. 

#### Paralysis (Ex)
Those hit by a ghoul's bite or claw attack must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Elves have immunity to this paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

### Lacedon

These cousins of the ghoul have the aquatic subtype. They lurk near hidden reefs or other places where ships are likely to meet their end. They have a base land speed of 30 feet and a swim speed of 30 feet and are found only in aquatic environments. 

### Ghast

Although these creatures look just like their lesser kin, they are far more deadly and cunning. 

#### Combat

#### Ghoul Fever (Su)
Disease---bite, Fortitude DC 15, incubation period 1 day, damage 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Paralysis (Ex)
Those hit by a ghast's bite or claw attack must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Even elves can be affected by this paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Stench (Ex)
The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures 

within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ghast's stench for 24 hours. A *delay poison* or *neutralize poison* spell removes the effect from a sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

## Giant

All giants speak Giant. Those with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher also speak Common. 

#### Combat

Giants relish melee combat. They favor massive two-handed weapons and wield them with impressive skill. They have enough cunning to soften up a foe with ranged attacks first, if they can. A giant's favorite ranged weapon is a big rock. 

#### Rock Throwing (Ex)
Adult giants are accomplished rock throwers and receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A giant of at least Large size can hurl rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each (Small objects) up to five range increments. The size of the range increment varies with the giant's variety. A Huge giant can hurl rocks of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium objects). 

#### Rock Catching (Ex)
A giant of at least Large size can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). 

Once per round, a giant that would normally be hit by a rock can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready for and aware of the attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.

Cloud giants' skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass, and their eyes are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old. 

Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). 

#### Combat

Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. 

#### Rock Throwing (Ex)
The range increment is 140 feet for a cloud giant's thrown rocks. 

#### Oversized Weapon (Ex)
A cloud giant wields a great, two-handed morningstar (big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without penalty.

Some fire giants have bright orange hair.. An adult male is 12 feet tall, has a chest that measures 9 feet 

around, and weighs about 7,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Fire giants can live to be 350 years old. 

Fire giants wear sturdy cloth or leather garments colored red, orange, yellow, or black. Warriors wear helmets and half-plate armor of blackened steel. 

#### Combat

Fire giants heat their rocks in a nearby fire, geyser, or lava pools, so that they deal extra fire damage. They favor magic flaming swords in melee (when they can get them). They are also fond of grabbing smaller opponents and tossing them somewhere very hot. 

#### Rock Throwing (Ex)
The range increment is 120 feet for a fire giant's thrown rocks. 

#### Fire Giant Characters

Most groups of fire giants include clerics. A fire giant cleric has access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Trickery, or War (most choose Trickery or War, some choose both).

A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors add chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers. 

An adult male is about 15 feet tall and weighs about 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical with males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old. 

#### Combat

Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with their enormous battleaxes. 

A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty reaching them. 

#### Rock Throwing (Ex)
The range increment is 120 feet for a frost giant's thrown rocks. 

### Frost Giant Jarl

A frost giant leader is often a barbarian, cleric, fighter, or sorcerer, but some of the most evil and ruthless frost giants become blackguards. 

The frost giant jarl described here has all the qualities and abilities of a typical frost giant, as well as other abilities (see the statistics block) from being a blackguard. Details on some of these abilities follow. 

#### Aura of Despair (Su)
This jarl radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a --2 penalty on all saving throws. 

#### Aura of Evil (Ex)
This jarl radiates a strong aura of evil (see the *detect evil* spell) as an 8th-level cleric of an evil deity. 

#### Command Undead (Su)
This jarl can command and rebuke undead as a 6th-level cleric. 

#### Dark Blessing (Su)
This jarl applies his Charisma modifier as a bonus on all saving throws. 

#### *Detect Good* (Sp)
At will, this jarl can use *detect good* as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effect of the *detect good* spell. 

#### Poison Use
Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade. 

#### Smite Good (Su)
Twice per day, this jarl may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. He adds his +4 Charisma modifier to his attack roll and deals 8 points of extra damage (1 per blackguard level) if the attack hits. If he accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day.

A gibbering mouther is a horrible creature seemingly drawn from a lunatic's nightmares. Although not evil, it thirsts after bodily fluids and seems to prefer the blood of intelligent creatures. 

A gibbering mouther is about 3 feet across and 3 to 4 feet high. It weighs about 200 pounds. 

Gibbering mouthers can speak Common, but seldom say anything other than gibberish. 

#### Combat

A gibbering mouther attacks by shooting out strings of protoplasmic flesh, each ending in one or more eyes and a mouth that bites at the enemy. A mouther can send out a total of six such members in any round. 

#### Gibbering (Su)
As soon as a mouther spots something edible, it begins a constant gibbering as a free action. All creatures (other than mouthers) within a 60-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as though by a *confusion* spell for 1d2 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same gibbering mouther's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Spittle (Ex)
As a free action every round, a gibbering mouther fires a stream of spittle at one opponent within 30 feet. The mouther makes a ranged touch attack; if it hits, it deals 1d4 points of acid damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Eyeless creatures are immune to the blinding effect, but are still subject to the acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a gibbering mouther must hit with a bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

#### Blood Drain (Ex)
On a successful grapple check after grabbing, that mouth attaches to the opponent. It automatically deals bite damage and drains blood, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round. A mouth can be ripped off (dealing 1 point of damage) with a DC 12 Strength check or severed by a successful sunder attempt (the mouth has 2 hit points). 

A severed mouth continues to bite and drain blood for 1d4 rounds after such an attack. A creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 is killed. 

#### Engulf (Ex)
A gibbering mouther can try to engulf a Medium or smaller opponent grabbed by three or more mouths. 

The opponent must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or fall and be engulfed. In the next round, the mouther makes twelve bite attacks instead of six (each with a +4 attack bonus). An engulfed creature cannot attack the mouther from within. The previously attached mouths are now free to attack others. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. 

#### Ground Manipulation (Su)
At will, as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in all adjacent squares to become a morass akin to quicksand. Softening earth, sand, or the like takes 1 round, while stone takes 2 rounds. Anyone other than the mouther in that area must take a move-equivalent action to avoid becoming mired (treat as being pinned). 

#### Amorphous (Ex)
A gibbering mouther is not subject to critical hits. It cannot be flanked. 

#### Skills
Thanks to their multiple eyes, gibbering mouthers have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks. 

A gibbering mouther has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

Girallons are savage, magical cousins of the gorilla. When moving on the ground, a girallon walks on its legs and lower arms. An adult girallon is about 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs about 800 pounds. 

#### Combat

A solitary girallon usually conceals itself in the branches of a tree or under a pile of leaves and brush, with only its nose showing. When it spots or scents prey, it charges to the attack. A girallon picks up prey that is small enough to carry and withdraws, often vanishing into the trees before the victim's companions can do anything to retaliate. Against larger foes, a girallon seeks to tear a single opponent to bits as quickly as it can. 

#### Rend (Ex)
A girallon that hits with two or more claw attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d4+12 points of damage. 

#### Skills
A girallon has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. A gnoll is a nocturnal carnivore, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. A gnoll is about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Gnolls speak Gnoll. 

#### Combat

Gnolls like to attack when they have the advantage of numbers, using horde tactics and their physical strength to overwhelm and knock down their opponents. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader; at such times, they can maintain ranks and fight as a unit. While they do not usually prepare traps, they do use ambushes and try to attack from a flanking position. Because of its shield, a gnoll's modifier on Hide checks (untrained) is --2, which means gnolls always take special care to seek favorable conditions when laying ambushes (such as darkness, cover, or some other form of advantageous terrain). 

#### Gnolls as Characters

Gnoll characters possess the following racial traits. 

- Strength +4, Constitution +2, Intelligence --2, Charisma --2.

- Size Medium.

- A gnoll's base land speed is 30 feet.

- Darkvision out to 60 feet.

- Racial Hit Dice: A gnoll begins with two levels of humanoid, which
provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0. 

- Racial Skills: A gnoll's humanoid levels give it skill points equal
to 5 x (2 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Listen and Spot. 

- Racial Feats: A gnoll's humanoid levels give it one feat.

-  +1 natural armor bonus.

- Automatic Languages: Gnoll. Bonus Languages: Common, Draconic, Elven,
Goblin, Orc. 

- Favored Class: Ranger.

Gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years. 

Gnomes speak their own language, Gnome. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders, tinkers, or adventurers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. 

Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level. 

#### Combat

Gnomes prefer misdirection and deception over direct confrontation. 

They would rather befuddle or embarrass foes (other than goblinoids or kobolds) than kill them. 

Gnomes make heavy use of illusion magic and carefully prepared ambushes and traps whenever they can. 

#### Gnome Traits (Ex)
Gnomes possess the following racial traits. 

-  +2 Constitution, --2 Strength.

- Small size. +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4
bonus on Hide checks, --4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting and carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters. 

- A gnome's base land speed is 20 feet.

- Low-light vision.

- Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial
weapons rather than exotic weapons. 

-  +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.

- Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion
spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat. 

-  +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids
(including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears). 

-  +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type
(such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants). 

-  +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.

-  +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks.

- Automatic Languages: Common, Gnome. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc.

only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of at least 10 also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day---*dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation.* Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome's Cha modifier + spell level. 

- Favored Class: Bard.

The gnome warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8. 

### Subraces

The information above is for rock gnomes, the most common variety. 

There are two other major gnome subraces, which differ from rock gnomes as follows. 

### Svirfneblin

Also called deep gnomes, svirfneblin are said to dwell in great cities deep underground. 

A svirfneblin has wiry, rock-colored skin usually medium brown to brownish gray. Only males are bald; females have stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin lifespan is 250 years. 

Svirfneblin speak Gnome, Common, and Undercommon. 

#### Svirfneblin Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the rock gnome traits, except where noted. 

-  --2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, --4 Charisma. These
adjustments replace the rock gnome's ability score adjustments. 

- Stonecunning: This ability grants deep gnomes a +2 racial bonus on
Search checks to notice unusual stonework. A deep gnome who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as though actively searching, and can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A svirfneblin can also intuit depth, sensing the approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. 

- Darkvision out to 120 feet and low-light vision.

- Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.

-  +2 racial bonus on all saving throws (figured into the statistics
for the character presented here). This trait replaces the rock gnome's racial bonus on saving throws against illusions. 

- Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion
spells cast by svirfneblin. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat. 

-  +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.

-  +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against all creatures (figured into
the statistics for the character presented here). This trait replaces the rock gnome's dodge bonus against giants. 

- Automatic Languages: Undercommon, Gnome, Common. Bonus Languages:
Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran. This trait replaces the rock gnome's automatic and bonus languages. 

- Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day---*blindness/deafness* (typical save DC
13), *blur, disguise self*. Caster level equals the svirfneblin's class levels. The save DC is Charisma-based and include a +4 racial modifier. This trait replaces the rock gnome's spell-like abilities. 

- Nondetection (Su): A svirfneblin has a continuous nondetection
ability as the spell (caster level equal to class levels). 

-  +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) and Listen checks.

-  +2 racial bonus on Hide checks, which improves to +4 underground.

- Favored Class: Rogue.

- Level adjustment +3.

The svirfneblin warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8. 

Challenge Rating: Svirfneblin with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to their character level. Svirfneblin with levels in PC classes have a CR equal to their character level +1. 

### Forest Gnome

They are the smallest of all the gnomes, averaging 2 to 2-1/2 feet in height, but look just like regular gnomes except with bark-colored or gray-green skin, and eyes that can be brown or green as well as blue. A very long-lived people, forest gnomes have an average life expectancy of 500 years. 

#### Forest Gnome Traits (Ex)
These traits are in addition to the rock gnome traits, except where noted. 

- *Pass without Trace* (Su): A forest gnome has the innate ability to
use *pass without trace* (self only, as a free action) as the spell cast by a druid of the forest gnome's class levels. 

-  +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds, goblinoids, orcs,
and reptilian humanoids. 

- Automatic Languages: Gnome, Elven, Sylvan, and a simple language that
enables them to communicate on a very basic level with forest animals (this replaces the rock gnome's *speak with animals* ability). Bonus Languages: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, Goblin, Orc. This trait replaces the rock gnome's automatic and bonus languages. 

-  +4 racial bonus on Hide checks, which improves to +8 in a wooded
area.

A goblin stands 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually dull and glazed, varying in color from red to yellow. A goblin's skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward drab, soiled-looking colors. Goblins speak Goblin; those with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher also speak Common. 

Most goblins encountered outside their homes are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level. 

#### Combat

Being bullied by bigger, stronger creatures has taught goblins to exploit what few advantages they have: sheer numbers and malicious ingenuity. The concept of a fair fight is meaningless in their society. They favor ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they can devise. 

Goblins have a poor grasp of strategy and are cowardly by nature, tending to flee the field if a battle turns against them. With proper supervision, though, they can implement reasonably complex plans, and in such circumstances their numbers can be a deadly advantage. 

#### Skills
Goblins have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently and Ride checks. Goblin cavalry (mounted on worgs) usually select the Mounted Combat feat in place of the Alertness feat, which reduces their Spot and Listen check modifiers from +3 to +1. 

#### Challenge Rating
Goblins with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to their character level --2. 

#### Goblins as Characters

Goblin characters possess the following racial traits. 

-  --2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, --2 Charisma.

- Small size: +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4
bonus on Hide checks, --4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting and carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters. 

- A goblin's base land speed is 30 feet.

- Darkvision out to 60 feet.

-  +4 racial bonus on Move Silently and Ride checks.

- Automatic Languages: Common, Goblin. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Orc. 

- Favored Class: Rogue.

The goblin warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8. 

## Golem

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces. 

The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The process of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator. 

#### Combat

Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well. Being mindless, they do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat and cannot be provoked. 

A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem's creator can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone else's control, and so on), but the golem's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to obey him alone. 

#### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted. 

#### Construction

The cost to create given for each golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. Creating a golem is essentially similar to creating any sort of magic item. However, a golem's body includes costly material components that may require some extra preparation. The golem's creator can assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The builder must have the appropriate skill, which varies with the golem variety. 

Completing the golem's creation drains the appropriate XP from the creator and requires casting any spells on the final day. 

The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls. 

The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a magic item (caster level, prerequisite feats and spells, market price, cost to create) are given in summary form at the end of each golem's description. 

*Note:* The market price of an advanced golem (a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry) is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die, and increased by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. The XP cost for creating an advanced golem is equal to 1/25 the advanced golem's market price minus the cost of the special materials required.

This golem has a humanoid body made from clay. A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips. 

A clay golem golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise. It walks and moves with a slow, clumsy gait. It weighs around 600 pounds. 

#### Combat

#### Berserk (Ex)
When a clay golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. Once a clay golem goes berserk, no known method can reestablish control. 

#### Cursed Wound (Ex)
The damage a clay golem deals doesn't heal naturally and resists healing spells. A character attempting to cast a conjuration (healing) spell on a creature damaged by a clay golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. 

#### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A clay golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. 

A *move earth* spell drives the golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it. 

A *disintegrate* spell slows the golem (as the *slow* spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage. 

An *earthquake* spell cast directly at a clay golem stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage. The golem gets no saving throw against any of these effects. 

Any magical attack against a clay golem that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, a clay golem hit by the breath weapon of a black dragon heals 7 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 22 points of damage. A clay golem golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage. 

#### Haste (Su)
After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a clay golem can haste itself once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell. 

#### Construction

A clay golem's body must be sculpted from a single block of clay weighing at least 1,000 pounds, treated with rare oils and powders worth 1,500 gp. Creating the body requires a DC 15 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 15 Craft (pottery) check.

A flesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid body parts, stitched together into a single composite form. No natural animal willingly tracks a flesh golem. The golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions and no weapons. It stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 500 pounds. 

A flesh golem golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. 

#### Combat

#### Berserk (Ex)
When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which requires a DC 19 Charisma check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem's berserk chance to 0%. 

#### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. 

A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh golem (as the *slow* spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. 

A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any *slow* effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, a flesh golem hit by a *lightning bolt* heals 3 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 11 points of damage. A flesh golem golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage. 

#### Construction

The pieces of a flesh golem must come from normal human corpses that have not decayed significantly. Assembly requires a minimum of six different bodies---one for each limb, the torso (including head), and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required. Note that creating a flesh golem requires casting a spell with the evil descriptor. 

Assembling the body requires a DC 13 Craft (leatherworking) check or a DC 13 Heal check. 

CL 8th; Craft Construct, *animate dead, bull's strength, geas/quest, limited wish*, caster must be at least 8th level; Price 20,000 gp; Cost 10,500 gp + 780 XP.

This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below), although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a thick, solid foundation. 

#### Combat

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
10-foot cube, cloud of poisonous gas lasting 1 round, free action once every 1d4+1 rounds; initial damage 1d4 Con, secondary damage 3d4 Con, Fortitude DC 19 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
An iron golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. 

A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as the *slow* spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. 

A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any *slow* effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, an iron golem hit by a *fireball* gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 18 points. An iron golem gets no saving throw against fire effects. 

An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a *rusting grasp* spell.

This golem has a humanoid body made from stone. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs. 

#### Combat

Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful and difficult to harm. 

#### Slow (Su)
A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. 

A *transmute rock to mud* spell slows a stone golem (as the *slow* spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while *transmute mud to rock* heals all of its lost hit points. 

A *stone to flesh* spell does not actually change the golem's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round. 

#### Construction

A stone golem's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 3,000 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality, and costs 5,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a DC 17 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 17 Craft (stonemasonry) check. 

CL 14th; Craft Construct, *antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning*, caster must be at least 14th level; Price 90,000 gp; Cost 50,000 gp + 3,400 XP. 

### Greater Stone Golem

A greater stone golem is 18 feet tall and weighs around 32,000 pounds. It resembles a typical stone golem in all respects, except that the Will save DC is 31 against its slow ability. CL 14th; Craft Construct, *antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning*, caster must be at least 14th level; Price 196,000 gp; Cost 105,000 gp + 7,640 XP.

A typical gorgon stands over 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 8 feet from snout to tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds. 

Gorgons are nothing if not aggressive. They attack intruders on sight, attempting to trample, gore, or petrify them. There is no way to calm these furious creatures, and they are impossible to domesticate. 

#### Combat

Whenever possible, a gorgon begins an encounter by charging at its opponents. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than five times per day), turn to stone permanently, Fortitude DC 19 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A gray render stands about 9 feet tall in spite of its hunched posture and is about 4 feet wide. It weighs about 4,000 pounds. 

Gray renders are never found in groups. Each of these asexual creatures produces one offspring and carries it for a time in a pouch, but thereafter the young render must fend for itself. 

A unique quality of the gray render is its tendency to bond with, protect, and provide for another creature (or group of creatures) native to its surroundings. Whether accepted or not, the render always attempts to remain fairly close, watching over its adopted charge(s) and daily bringing an offering of meat. It never willingly harms adopted creatures and retreats if they attack it. 

#### Combat

A gray render attacks to kill, whether to bring down prey or to protect itself or those it has adopted. When hunting, it sometimes attempts to hide and wait for prey to wander close. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a gray render must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

#### Rend (Ex)
A gray render that wins a grapple check after a successful bite attack establishes a hold, latching onto the opponent's body and tearing the flesh. This attack automatically deals 2d6+9 points of damage. 

#### Skills
Gray renders have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks due to their six keen eyes.

An adult grick is about 8 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the end of its body and weighs some 200 pounds. Its body coloration is uniformly dark, with a pale underbelly. 

#### Combat

Gricks attack when hungry or threatened. They hunt by holing up near high-traffic areas, using their natural coloration to blend into convenient shadows. When prey (virtually anything that moves) ventures near, they lash out with their tentacles. A grick's rubbery body seems to shed blows of any kind. Its jaws are relatively small and weak compared to its body mass, so rather than consume its kill immediately, a grick normally drags its victim back to its lair to be eaten at its leisure. 

A grick's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

Multiple gricks do not fight in concert. Each attacks the prey closest to it, and breaks off the fight as soon as it can drag dead or unconscious prey away. 

#### Skills
A grick has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened. 

\*Their coloration affords gricks a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when in natural rocky areas.

Griffons are powerful, majestic creatures with the characteristics of both lions and eagles. From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature's back and span 25 feet or more. A griffon weighs about 500 pounds. 

A griffon cannot speak, but understands Common. 

#### Combat

Griffons prefer to pounce on their prey, either diving to the attack or leaping from above. 

#### Pounce (Ex)
If a griffon dives upon or charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks. 

#### Rake (Ex)
Attack bonus +8 melee, damage 1d6+2. 

#### Skills
Griffons have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Spot checks. 

#### Training a Griffon

Although intelligent, a griffon requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a griffon must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly griffon requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a griffon requires an exotic saddle. A griffon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. 

Griffon eggs are worth 3,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 7,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a griffon. 

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a griffon is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

#### Combat

Grimlocks are blind, but their exceptional senses of smell and hearing allow them to notice foes nearby. As a result, they usually shun ranged weapons and rush to the attack, brandishing their stone battleaxes. 

#### Blindsight (Ex)
Grimlocks can sense all foes within 40 feet as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they treat all targets as having total concealment. 

Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and scent-based attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as *ghost sound* or *silence*) and overpowering odors (such as *stinking cloud* or incense-heavy air). Negating a grimlock's sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded. 

#### Immunities
Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. 

#### Skills
\*A grimlock's dull gray skin helps it hide in its native terrain, conferring a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in mountains or underground. 

#### Grimlocks as Characters

Grimlock characters possess the following racial traits. 

-  +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, --2 Wisdom, --4
Charisma. 

- Medium size.

- A grimlock's base land speed is 30 feet.

- Racial Hit Dice: A grimlock begins with two levels of monstrous
humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +0, Ref +3, and Will +3.

points equal to 5 x (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1). Its class skills are Climb, Hide, Listen, and Spot. Grimlocks gain a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks in mountain or underground settings. 

- Racial Feats: A grimlock's monstrous humanoid levels give it one
feat. 

- Weapon Proficiency: A grimlock is automatically proficient with the
battleaxe. 

-  +4 natural armor bonus.

- Special Qualities (see above): Blindsight 40 ft., immunities, scent.

- Automatic Languages: Common, Grimlock. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
Dwarven, Gnome, Terran, Undercommon.
