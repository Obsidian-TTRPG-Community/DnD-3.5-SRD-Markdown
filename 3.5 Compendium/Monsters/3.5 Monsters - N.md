# MONSTERS N

**[[3.5 Monsters - M|Previous: Monsters M.]]

## Naga

All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales, and more or less human faces. They range in length from 10 to 20 feet and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light. 

#### Combat

Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost always found in the lairs they guard and know well, they can arrange most encounters to suit their wishes.

Guardian nagas speak Celestial and Common. 

#### Combat

Guardian nagas usually warn off intruders before attacking. If the warning is ignored, they may begin a spell assault or spit poison. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury or contact, Fortitude DC 19, initial and secondary damage 1d10 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Spit (Ex)
A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make successful saves (see above) to avoid the effect. 

#### Spells
Guardian nagas cast spells as 9th-level sorcerers, and can also cast spells from the cleric list and from the Good and Law domains. The cleric spells and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a guardian naga, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.

A night hag is about the same height and weight as a female human. 

Night hags speak Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal. 

#### Combat

Night hags attack good creatures on sight if the odds of success seem favorable. 

These creatures rip through armor and flesh with their deadly teeth. They love to use *sleep* and then strangle those who are overcome by it. 

A night hag's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Disease (Ex)
Demon fever---bite, Fortitude DC 18, incubation period 1 day, damage 1d6 Con. Each day after the first, on a failed save, an afflicted creature must immediately succeed on another DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution drain. The save DC is Constitution based. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Chaos\|Detect Chaos]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Evil\|Detect Evil]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Good\|Detect Good]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Law\|Detect Law]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Magic\|Detect Magic]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Magic Missile\|Magic Missile]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Polymorph\|Polymorph]] (self Only), [[3.5 Spell List#Ray Of Enfeeblement\|Ray Of Enfeeblement]] (DC 12), [[3.5 Spell List#Sleep\|Sleep]] (DC 12);
 -  Caster level 8th. A night hag can use *etherealness* at will (caster level 16th) so long as it possesses its *heartstone* (see below). The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Dream Haunting (Su)
Night hags can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil individuals by using a special periapt known as a *heartstone* to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once a hag invades someone's dreams, it rides on the victim's back until dawn. The sleeper suffers from tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal intrusions, by confronting and defeating the night hag. 

#### Heartstone

All night hags carry a periapt known as a *heartstone,* which instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a *heartstone* provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use *etherealness* until it can manufacture another (which takes one month). Creatures other than the hag can benefit from the *heartstone*'s powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses (any disease cured or saving throw affected 

counts as a use) and it does not bestow *etherealness* to a bearer that is not a night hag. If sold, an intact *heartstone* brings 1,800 gp.

A nightmare is about the size of a light war horse. 

#### Combat

A nightmare can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also fight unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. 

A nightmare's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Flaming Hooves (Su)
A blow from a nightmare's hooves sets combustible materials alight. 

#### Smoke (Su)
During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and neighs with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a --2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare's vision at all. 

#### Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su)
These abilities function just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare can use either at will. 

#### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a nightmare is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds. 

### Cauchemar

The cauchemar is a horrible, especially malevolent version of a nightmare. The sight of one of these great horrors bearing down is enough to shake the heart of the boldest champion. 

#### Combat

The save DC for the cauchemar's smoke attack (DC 24) is adjusted for its greater number of Hit Dice and higher Constitution score. 

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a cauchemar is up to 612 pounds; a medium load, 613--1,224 pounds; and a heavy load, 1,225--1,840 pounds. 

## Nightshade

Nightshades are powerful undead composed of equal parts darkness and absolute evil. 

Nightshades can read and understand all forms of communication; however, they communicate with others by telepathy. 

#### Combat

Each of the three known varieties of nightshade is a terrible creature with unique powers and abilities. Their tactics vary according to their abilities, but they all make liberal use of *haste*. 

#### Nightshade Abilities

All nightshades have the following special abilities. 

#### Aversion to Daylight (Ex)
If exposed to natural daylight (not merely a *daylight* spell), nightshades take a --4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. 

#### Desecrating Aura (Su)
All nightshades give off a 20-footradius emanation of utter desecration, imbuing their surroundings with negative energy. This ability works much like a *desecrate* spell, except that the nightshade's evil is so great that it is treated as the shrine of an evil power. All undead within 20 feet of the nightshade (including the creature itself ) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The nightshade Hit Dice, attack, and save entries given here include these profane bonuses.) Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area take a --6 penalty. 

A nightshade's desecrating aura cannot be dispelled except by a *dispel evil* spell or similar effect. If the effect is dispelled, the nightshade can resume it as a free action on its next turn. Its desecrating aura is suppressed if a nightshade enters a *consecrated* or *hallowed* area, but the nightshade's presence also suppresses the *consecrated* or *hallowed* effect for as long as it remains in the area.

A nightcrawler is a massive behemoth similar to a purple worm, though utterly black in color. 

A nightcrawler measures about 7 feet in diameter and is 100 feet long from its toothy maw to the tip of its stinging tail. It weighs about 55,000 pounds. 

#### Combat

A nightcrawler attacks by burrowing through the ground and emerging to strike. 

A nightcrawler's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Energy Drain (Su)
Living creatures inside a nightcrawler's gizzard gain one negative level each round. The DC is 26 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

For each such negative level bestowed, the nightcrawler gains 5 temporary hit points. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a nightcrawler must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#### Summon Undead (Su)
A nightcrawler can summon undead creatures once per night: 9--16 shadows, 3--6 greater shadows, or 2--4 dread wraiths. The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released. 

#### Swallow Whole (Ex)
A nightcrawler can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus 12 points of acid damage per round from the nightcrawler's gizzard and is subject to the creature's energy drain. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 21). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A nightcrawler's interior can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, 512 Tiny or smaller opponents.

#### Skills
\*When hiding in a dark area, a nightwalker gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks. 

#### Tactics Round-by-Round

The nightwalker is an exceedingly intelligent foe that makes the best use of all its abilities. It favors using its spell-like abilities to divide and disable its enemies, then closing to melee with opponents it has isolated from their allies. 

*Prior to combat:* The nightwalker keeps its *see invisibility* power active most of the time. It uses *haste* and *invisibility* to prepare for battle. 

*Round 1:* Move to within 30 feet to make use of gaze attack and strike with *confusion* or *hold monster,* coupled with a quickened *unholy blight.* 

*Round 2:* Hit a spellcaster with *finger of death* and another quickened *unholy blight.* 

*Round 3:* Move up to engage the enemy and attempt to disarm an enemy fighter. 

*Round 4:* Crush the disarmed weapon (or use gaze attack if disarm attempt failed). 

*Round 5:* Full attack against the unarmed foe (or on a nearby spellcaster).

Nightwings are batlike flyers that hunt on the wing. 

A nightwing has a wingspan of about 40 feet and weighs about 4,000 pounds. 

#### Combat

Nightwings prowl the night sky and dive onto their victims. They are all but invisible, detectable only because of the stars they obscure in their passing. 

A nightwing's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Magic Drain (Su)
A nightwing can weaken magic armor, weapons, and shields by making a successful touch attack. The targeted item must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or lose 1 point of its enhancement bonus. The save DC is Charisma-based. An item that loses its entire enhancement bonus becomes merely a masterwork item and loses any special abilities (such as flaming) as well. Casting *dispel evil* upon the item reverses the effect of the magic drain, provided this occurs within a number of days after the attack equal to the caster's level and the caster succeeds on a DC 29 caster level check.

#### Skills
\*When hiding in a dark area or flying in a dark sky, a nightwing gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks.
