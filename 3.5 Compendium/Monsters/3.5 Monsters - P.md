The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily tamed. 

A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Pegasi cannot speak, but they understand Common. 

#### Combat

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Detect Good And Detect Evil Within A 60\|Detect Good And Detect Evil Within A 60]] -foot Radius;
 -  Caster level 5th.

#### Skills
Pegasi have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. 

### Training a Pegasus

Although intelligent, a pegasus requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a pegasus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly pegasus requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. 

Pegasus eggs are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life. 

#### Carrying Capacity
A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301--600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601--900 pounds.

This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a cluster of nodules atop the main mass, though it is visible only when dead. A cluster of nodules atop the main mass serve as sensory organs. The creature feeds and attacks with a gaping maw lined with rows of teeth. Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it to move about. This ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared predator among subterranean inhabitants. 

#### Combat

A phantom fungus usually roams quietly, hunting for prey. It attacks lone individuals almost anywhere, but when tackling groups it prefers an open space where it has a better chance . 

#### Greater Invisibility (Su)
This ability is constant, allowing a phantom fungus to remain invisible even when attacking. It works like *greater invisibility* (caster level 12th) and lasts as long as the phantom fungus is alive. This ability is not subject to the *invisibility purge* spell. A phantom fungus becomes visible 1 minute after it is killed. 

#### Skills
A phantom fungus has a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

Phase spiders are aggressive predators that can move quickly from the Ethereal Plane to attack opponents on the Material Plane. 

A typical phase spider's body is 8 feet long. It weighs about 700 pounds. 

Phase spiders cannot speak. 

#### Combat

Phase spiders dwell and hunt on the Material Plane. Once a spider locates prey, however, it shifts to the Ethereal Plane to attack, attempting to catch its victim flat-footed. The spider shifts in, bites its victim, and retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. 

#### Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
A phase spider can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or during a move action). The ability is otherwise identical with *ethereal jaunt* (caster level 15th). 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 1d8 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Skills
A phase spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

A phasm is an amorphous creature that can assume the guise of almost any other creature or object. A phasm in its natural form is about 5 feet in diameter and 2 feet high at the center. Swirls of color indicate sensory organs. In this form, a phasm slithers about like an ooze and can attack with a pseudopod. It weighs about 400 pounds. 

Phasms can speak Common but prefer telepathic communication. 

#### Combat

When faced with potential danger, a phasm is equally likely to retreat, parley, or attack, as its fancy strikes. 

If pursued or harassed, a phasm transforms into the most fearsome creature it knows and attacks. When seriously hurt, it changes to some fast or agile form and tries to escape. 

#### Amorphous (Ex)
A phasm in its natural form has immunity to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. It is not subject to critical hits and, having no clear front or back, cannot be flanked. 

#### Resilient (Ex)
A phasm has a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves (included in the statistics block). 

Alternate Form (Su): A phasm can assume any form of Large size or smaller as a standard action. This ability functions as a *polymorph* spell cast on itself (caster level 15th), except that the phasm does not regain hit points for changing form. A phasm can remain in its alternate form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form. 

#### Tremorsense (Ex)
A phasm can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground, so long as it is touching the ground itself. 

#### Skills
\*When using shapechange, a phasm gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. 

## Planetouched

Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can trace his or her bloodline back to an outsider, usually a fiend or celestial. 

The effects of having a supernatural being in one's heritage last for many generations. Although not as dramatically altered as a half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special qualities. 

The two planetouched varieties described here are the most common. Aasimars are humans with some trace of celestial blood in their veins, and tieflings have some fiendishness in their family tree.

Aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and generally pleasant. Some have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as silver hair, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare. 

Most aasimars are decidedly good-aligned. They fight against evil causes and attempt to sway others to do the right thing. Occasionally they take on the vengeful, judgmental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this is rare. 

#### Combat

Aasimars usually like a fair, straightforward contest. Against a particularly evil foe, however, they fight with utter conviction and to the death.

The body of a mature purple worm is 5 feet in diameter and 80 feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds. The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail. 

#### Combat

In battle, a purple worm forms into a coil 20 feet in diameter, biting and stinging anything within reach. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a purple worm must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can attempt to swallow the foe the following round. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 25, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Swallow Whole (Ex)
A purple worm can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of a smaller size than itself by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of crushing damage plus 8 points of acid damage per round from the worm's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 17). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan worm's interior can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents. 

#### Skills
A purple worm has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
