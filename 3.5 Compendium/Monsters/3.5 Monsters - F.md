# MONSTERS F

**[[3.5 Monsters - E|Previous: Monsters E.]]

## Fiendish Creature

Fiendish creatures dwell on the lower planes, the realms of evil, although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more fearsome in appearance than their earthly counterparts. 

### Creating a Fiendish Creature

"Fiendish" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin of nongood alignment (referred to thereafter as the base creature). 

A fiendish creature uses all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes. 

#### Size and Type
Animals or vermin with this template become magical beasts, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged. Fiendish creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the extraplanar subtype. 

#### Special Attacks
A fiendish creature retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following special attack. 

***Smite Good (Su):***Once per day the creature can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD total (maximum of +20) against a good foe. 

#### Special Qualities
A fiendish creature retains all the special qualities of the base creature and also gains the following. 

- Darkvision out to 60 feet.

- Damage reduction (see the table below).

- Resistance to cold and fire (see the table below).

- Spell resistance equal to the creature's HD + 5 (maximum 25).

If the base creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value. 

If a fiendish creature gains damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Abilities
Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least 3. 

#### Environment
Any evil-aligned plane. 

#### Challenge Rating
HD 3 or less, as base creature; HD 4 to 7, as 

base creature +1; HD 8 or more, as base creature +2. 

#### Alignment
Always evil (any). 

#### Level Adjustment
Same as the base creature +2. 

|Hit Dice|Resistance to Cold and Fire|Damage Reduction|
|---|---|---|
|1-3|5|-|
|4-7|5|5/magic|
|8-11|10|5/magic|
|12 or more|10|10/magic|

A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety. 

#### Combat

Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior. 

#### Hive Mind (Ex)
All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are. 

### Worker

While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as danger) by body movements. Through the hive mind, however, they can communicate just fine---although their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can grasp. 

A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for manual labor. 

#### Combat

Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their mandibled bite. 

A formian worker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### *Cure Serious Wounds* (Sp)
Eight workers together can heal a creature's wounds as though using the *cure serious wounds* spell (caster level 7th). This is a full-round action for all eight workers. 

#### *Make Whole* (Sp)
Three workers together can repair an object as though using the *make whole* spell (caster level 7th). This is a fullround action for all three workers. 

### Warrior

Warriors communicate through the hive mind to convey battle plans and make reports to their commanders. They cannot speak otherwise. 

A warrior is about is about 5 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 180 pounds. 

#### Combat

Warriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting all at once. Through the hive mind, they attack with coordinated and extremely efficient tactics. 

A formian warrior's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

### Taskmaster

These formians communicate only telepathically and derive sustenance from the mental energies of those they dominate. 

A taskmaster is about the same size as a warrior. 

#### Combat

Taskmasters rely on their dominated slaves to fight for them if at all possible. If necessary, though, they can defend themselves with claws and a poison sting. 

A formian taskmaster's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Dominate Monster (Su)
A taskmaster can use a *dominate monster* ability as the spell from a 10th-level caster (Will DC 17 negates), although the subject may be of any kind and may be up to Large size. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same taskmaster's dominate monster ability for 24 hours. A single taskmaster can dominate up to four subjects at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Dominated Creature (Ex)
A taskmaster is never encountered alone. One dominated nonformian creature always accompanies it (choose or determine randomly any creature of CR 4). 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

### Myrmarch

Myrmarchs are the elite of formian society. Much more than those beneath them, these creatures are individuals, with goals, desires, and creative thought. 

A myrmarch is about is about 7 feet long and about 5-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 1,500 pounds. Its claws are capable of fine manipulation, like human hands. Each myrmarch wears a bronze helm to signify its position (the more elaborate the helm, the more prestigious the position). 

Myrmarchs speak Formian and Common. 

#### Combat

Myrmarchs' claws are like hands and thus serve no combat purpose. 

Myrmarchs occasionally employ javelins for ranged attacks, coated with poison from their own stingers. 

They fight intelligently, aiding those under them (if any such are present) and commanding them through the hive mind. If chaotic creatures are present, however, a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy them. 

A formian myrmarch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities

 -  Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Queen

The formian queen cannot move. With her telepathic abilities, though, she can send instructions to and get reports from any formian within her range. 

She is about 10 feet long, perhaps 4 feet high, and weighs about 3,500 pounds. 

The queen speaks Formian and Common, although she can communicate with any creature telepathically. 

#### Combat

The queen does not fight. She has no ability to move. If necessary, a team of workers and myrmarchs (or dominated slaves) haul her enormous bulk to where she needs to go. This sort of occurrence is very rare, however, and most of the time the queen remains within her well-defended chambers. 

Despite her utter lack of physical activity, the queen can cast spells and use spell-like abilities to great effect in her own defense as well as the defense of the hive-city. 

#### Spells
The queen casts arcane spells as a 17th-level sorcerer.

A frost worn cannot burrow through stone, but can manage ice and frozen earth. When moving through such hard materials it leaves behind a usable tunnel about 5 feet in diameter. 

A frost worm is about 40 feet long, 5 feet in diameter, and weighs about 8,000 pounds. 

#### Combat

Frost worms lurk under the snow, waiting for prey to come near. 

They begin an attack with a trill and then set upon helpless prey with their bite. 

#### Trill (Su)
A frost worm can emit a noise that forces its prey to stand motionless. This sonic mind-affecting compulsion affects all creatures other than frost worms within a 100-foot radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be stunned for as long as the worm trills and for 1d4 rounds thereafter, even if they are attacked. However, if attacked or violently shaken (a full-round action), a victim is allowed another saving throw. Once a creature has resisted or broken the effect, it cannot be affected again by that same frost worm's trill for 24 hours. The effect's caster level is 14th. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Cold (Ex)
A frost worm's body generates intense cold, causing opponents to take an extra 1d8 points of cold damage every time the creature succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures attacking a frost worm unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
30-foot cone, once per hour, damage 15d6 cold, Reflex DC 22 half. Opponents held motionless by the frost worm's trill get no saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Death Throes (Ex)
When killed, a frost worm turns to ice and shatters in an explosion that deals 12d6 points of cold damage and 8d6 points of piercing damage to everything within 100 feet (Reflex half DC 22). The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Skills
\*A frost worm, due to its coloration and its affinity for burying itself in the snow, has a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks in its native environment.

#### Combat

Shriekers and violet fungi often work together to attract and kill prey. When the shriekers' hellish racket attracts a curious creature, the violet fungus tries to kill it. Both creatures enjoy the fruits of a successful hunt. 

### Shrieker

A shrieker is a stationary fungus that emits a loud noise to attract prey or when disturbed. Shriekers live in dark, subterranean places, often in the company of violet fungi, whose poison they are immune to. 

Shriekers come in of shades of purple. 

#### Combat

A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures prey to its vicinity by emitting a loud noise. 

#### Shriek (Ex)
Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. The sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers come to learn that the fungus's noise means there is food nearby. 

### Violet Fungus

Violet fungi resemble shriekers and are often found growing among them. 

A violet fungi's coloration ranges from purple overall to dull gray or violet covered with purple spots. 

#### Combat

A violet fungus flails about with its tentacles at living creatures that come within its reach. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d4 Str and 1d4 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based. --- lang: en title: v3.5 SRD / Monsters / Monsters (G) ---
