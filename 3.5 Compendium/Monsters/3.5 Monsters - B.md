A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a goblin--wolf hybrid with terrible jaws and sharp claws. As whelps, barghests are nearly indistinguishable from wolves, except for their size and claws. As they grow larger and stronger, their skin darkens to bluishred and eventually becomes blue altogether. 

A full-grown barghest is about 6 feet long and weighs 180 pounds. A barghest's eyes glow orange when the creature becomes excited. 

Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal. 

#### Combat

Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their form, and usually disdain weapons. Though they love killing, they have little stomach for direct combat and attack from ambush whenever possible. Barghests start a combat by using *crushing despair* and *charm monster* to keep opponents off balance. They try to stay away from the enemy's main strength. 

A barghest's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Blink\|Blink]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Levitate\|Levitate]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Misdirection\|Misdirection]] (DC 14), [[3.5 Spell List#Rage\|Rage]] (DC 15);
 - **1/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Charm Monster\|Charm Monster]] (DC 16), [[3.5 Spell List#Crushing Despair\|Crushing Despair]] (DC 16), [[3.5 Spell List#Dimension Door\|Dimension Door]] ;
 - * Caster level equals the barghest’s HD. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

#### Feed (Su)
When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a *wish, miracle,* or *true resurrection* spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. 

A barghest advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a barghest devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements normally. 

The barghest only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a greater barghest upon completion of the act. 

#### Change Shape (Su)
A barghest can assume the shape of a goblin or a wolf as a standard action. In goblin form, a barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In wolf form, a barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack. 

#### Pass Without Trace (Ex)
A barghest in wolf form can use pass without trace (as the spell) as a free action. 

#### Skills
\*A barghest in wolf form gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Hide checks. 

### Greater Barghest

A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding becomes a greater barghest. These creatures can change shape into a goblinlike creature of Large size (about 8 feet tall and 400 pounds) or a dire wolf. In goblin form, a greater barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In dire wolf form, a greater barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack. 

A greater barghest can reach a maximum of 18 Hit Dice through feeding. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - In addition to the spelllike abilities all barghests possess, a greater barghest gains the following abilities.
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Invisibility Sphere\|Invisibility Sphere]] ;
 - **1/day:** [[3.5 Spell List#Bull’s Strength, Mass\|Bull’s Strength, Mass]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Enlarge, Mass\|Enlarge, Mass]] ;
 - * Caster level equals the greater barghest’s HD.

#### Combat

Occasionally, a greater barghest uses a magic two-handed weapon in combat instead of its claws, giving it multiple attacks (attack bonus +13/+8). It can also make one bite attack (attack bonus +8) each round. The save DC against a greater barghest's spell-like abilities is 14 + spell level.

A basilisk is a reptilian monster that petrifies living creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk's body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature weighs about 300 pounds. 

#### Combat

A basilisk relies on its gaze attack, biting only when opponents come within reach. Though it has eight legs, its slow metabolism renders it relatively sluggish, so it does not expend energy unnecessarily. Intruders who flee a basilisk rather than fight can expect, at best, a halfhearted pursuit. These creatures tend to spend most of their time lying in wait for prey, which includes small mammals, birds, reptiles, and similar creatures. 

#### Petrifying Gaze (Su)
Turn to stone permanently, range 30 feet; Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Skills
\*The basilisk's dull coloration and its ability to remain motionless for long periods of time grant it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in natural settings. 

### Abyssal Greater Basilisk

#### Combat

The save DC for the abyssal greater basilisk's petrifying gaze (DC 21) is adjusted for its greater Hit Dice and higher Charisma score. 

An abyssal greater basilisk's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Smite Good (Su)
Once per day an abyssal greater basilisk can make a normal melee attack to deal an extra 18 points of damage against a good foe. 

## Behir

The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or use its dozen legs to move with considerable speed. A behir is about 40 feet long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. It can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in snake fashion if it desires. The coloration of behirs ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the head look dangerous but are actually used for preening the creature's scales, not for fighting. 

Behirs speak Common. 

#### Combat

A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows or constricts the opponent. It can employ its claws only against foes caught in its coils. If beset by a large number of foes, it uses its breath weapon. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
20-foot line, once every 10 rounds, damage 7d6 electricity, Reflex DC 19 half. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Constrict (Ex)
A behir deals 2d8+8 points of damage with a successful grapple check. It can make six rake attacks against a grappled foe as well. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a behir must hit a creature of any size with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

If it wins the grapple check, it it establishes a hold and can attempt to constrict the opponent or swallow the opponent in the following round. 

#### Rake (Ex)
Six claws, attack bonus +15 melee, damage 1d4+4. 

#### Swallow Whole (Ex)
A behir can try to swallow a grabbed Medium or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check. 

A behir that swallows an opponent can use its Cleave feat to bite and grab another opponent. 

A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the behir's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. 

A behir's gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents. 

#### Skills
Behirs have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

Belkers are creatures from the Plane of Air. They are composed primarily of smoke. Although undeniably evil, they are very reclusive and usually have no interest in the affairs of others. A belker's winged shape makes it look distinctly demonic. It is about 7 feet long and weighs about 8 pounds. 

Belkers speak Auran. 

#### Combat

In most cases, a belker fights with its nasty claws and painful bite. 

#### Smoke Claws (Ex)
A belker in smoke form (see below) can engulf opponents by moving on top of them. It fills the air around one Medium or smaller opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature. The save DC is Constitution-based. Smoke inside the victim solidifies into a claw and begins to rip at the surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. An affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each subsequent round to cough out the semivaporous menace. 

#### Smoke Form (Su)
Most of the time a belker is more or less solid, but at will it can assume smoke form. It can switch forms once per round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in smoke form. A belker in smoke form can fly at a speed of 50 feet (perfect). The ability is otherwise similar to a *gaseous form* spell (caster level 7th). 

#### Skills
Belkers have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited teleportation ability. 

Blink dogs have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps, whines, and growls that can transmit complex information. 

#### Combat

Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in a seemingly random fashion until they surround their prey, allowing some of them to take advantage of flanking. 

#### Blink (Su)
A blink dog can use *blink* as the spell (caster level 8th), and can evoke or end the effect as a free action. 

#### Dimension Door (Su)
A blink dog can teleport, as *dimension door* (caster level 8th), once per round as a free action. The ability affects only the blink dog, which never appears within a solid object and can act immediately after teleporting.

A bodak retains fleeting memories of its past life and can speak Common (or some other humanoid language). 

#### Combat

Death, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates. Humanoids who die from this attack are transformed into bodaks 24 hours later. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)
Bodaks loathe sunlight, for its merest touch burns their impure flesh. Each round of exposure to the direct rays of the sun deals 1 point of damage to the creature.

In addition to their natural form, bralanis can assume the shape of a whirlwind or zephyr of dust, snow, or sand. 

Bralanis speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their *tongues* ability. 

#### Combat

Bralanis prefer the scimitar and bow, the weapons of the desert nomads they most closely resemble. 

A bralani's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

When in whirlwind form, a bralani can attack with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of damage in a 20-foot line (Reflex DC 16 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Alternate Form (Su)
A bralani can shift between its humanoid and whirlwind forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its whirlwind blast, but it can use its spell-like abilities and its weapons. In whirlwind form, it can fly, make slam attacks and whirlwind blast attacks, and use spell-like abilities. 

A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any particular form when killed. A *true seeing* spell, however, reveals both forms simultaneously. 

#### Tongues (Su)
Bralanis can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a *tongues* spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.

Also known as the landshark, the bulette is a terrifying predator that lives only to eat. 

#### Combat

A bulette attacks anything it regards as edible, choosing the easiest or closest prey first. The only creatures it refuses to eat are elves (and it dislikes the taste of dwarves). When burrowing underground, a landshark relies on its tremorsense ability to detect prey. 

When it senses something edible (that is, senses movement), it breaks to the surface, crest first, and begins its attack. 

#### Leap (Ex)
A bulette can jump into the air during combat. This allows it to make four claw attacks instead of two, each with a +15 attack bonus, but it cannot bite.
