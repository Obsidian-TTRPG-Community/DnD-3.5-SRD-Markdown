The tarrasque is 70 feet long and 50 feet tall, and it weighs about 130 tons. 

The tarrasque cannot speak. 

#### Combat

The tarrasque attacks with its claws, teeth, horns, and tail. 

The tarrasque's natural weapons are treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

### Augmented Critical (Ex)
The tarrasque's bite threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 18--20, dealing triple damage on a successful critical hit. 

### Frightful Presence (Su)
The tarrasque can inspire terror by charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condition as long as they remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, the tarrasque must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round. 

### Rush (Ex)
Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet. 

#### Swallow Whole (Ex)
The tarrasque can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the tarrasque's digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the tarrasque's digestive tract (AC 25). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The tarrasque's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures. 

### Carapace (Ex)
The tarrasque's armorlike carapace is exceptionally tough and highly reflective, deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even *magic missile*spells. There is a 30% chance of reflecting any such effect back at the caster; otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for reflection before rolling to overcome the creature's spell resistance. 

#### Regeneration (Ex)
No form of attack deals lethal damage to the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a *disintegrate* spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature's full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hp). The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem's cursed wound ability. 

The tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hit points) and using a *wish* or *miracle* spell to keep it dead. 

If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump. 

#### Skills
The tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. 

## Tendriculos



|  | Huge Plant | 
|---|---|
| Hit Dice: | 9d8+54 (94 hp) | 
| Initiative: | --1 | 
| Speed: | 20 ft. (4 squares) | 
| Armor Class: | 16 (--2 size, --1 Dex, +9 natural), touch 7, flat-footed 16 | 
| Base Attack/Grapple: | +6/+23 | 
| Attack: | Bite +13 melee (2d8+9) and 2 tendrils +8 melee (1d6+4) | 
| Full Attack: | Bite +13 melee (2d8+9) and 2 tendrils +8 melee (1d6+4) | 
| Space/Reach: | 15 ft./15 ft. | 
| Special Attacks: | Improved grab, paralysis, swallow whole | 
| Special Qualities: | Low-light vision, plant traits, regeneration 10 | 
| Saves: | Fort +12, Ref +2, Will +4 | 
| Abilities: | Str 28, Dex 9, Con 22, Int 3, Wis 8, Cha 3 | 
| Skills: | [[3.5 Skill List#Hide\|Hide]] +9, [[3.5 Skill List#Listen\|Listen]] +1, [[3.5 Skill List#Move Silently\|Move Silently]] +1, [[3.5 Skill List#Spot\|Spot]] +1; | 
| Feats: | [[3.5 Feat List#Alertness\|Alertness]] , [[3.5 Feat List#Iron Will\|Iron Will]] , [[3.5 Feat List#Power Attack\|Power Attack]] , [[3.5 Feat List#Stealthy\|Stealthy]] ; | 
| Environment: | Temperate forests | 
| Organization: | Solitary | 
| Challenge Rating: | 6 | 
| Treasure: | 1/10th coins; 50% goods; 50% items | 
| Alignment: | Always neutral | 
| Advancement: | 10--16 HD (Huge); 17--27 HD (Gargantuan) | 
| Level Adjustment: | --- | 
A tendriculos can rear up to a height of 15 feet. It weighs about 3,500 pounds. 

Animals and other plant creatures are unnerved by the presence of a tendriculos; they avoid it and any place it has been within the last 24 hours. 

#### Combat

Prowling deep forests or waiting in vegetated areas (looking like nothing more than a small hillock), a tendriculos attacks savagely, showing no fear. It attempts to swallow as much flesh as it can, as quickly as it can. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a tendriculos must hit a creature at least one size smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round. A tendriculos can also use its improved grab ability on a tendril attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, picks up the opponent, and transfers it to the mouth as a free action, automatically dealing bite damage. 

#### Swallow Whole/Paralysis (Ex)
A tendriculos can try to swallow a grabbed opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside the plant's mass, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos's digestive juices, taking 2d6 points of acid damage per round. A new save is required each round inside the plant. The save DC is Constitution-based. A swallowed creature that avoids paralysis can climb out of the mass with a successful grapple check. This returns it to the plant's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. A swallowed creature can also cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the tendriculos's interior (AC 14). Once the creature exits, the plant's regenerative capacity closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge tendriculos's interior can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents. 

#### Regeneration (Ex)
Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal normal damage to a tendriculos. A tendriculos that loses part of its body mass can regrow it in 1d6 minutes. Holding the severed portion against the mass enables it to reattach instantly. 

## Thoqqua



|  | Medium Elemental (Earth, Extraplanar, Fire) | 
|---|---|

| Organization: | Solitary or pair | 
| Challenge Rating: | 2 | 
| Treasure: | None | 
| Alignment: | Usually neutral | 
| Advancement: | 4--9 HD (Large) | 
| Level Adjustment: | --- | 
A thoqqua is about 1 foot in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long. It weighs about 200 pounds. 

#### Combat

When a thoqqua is disturbed, its first instinct is to attack. Its favored tactic is to spring directly at a foe, either by bursting out of the rock or by coiling up its body and launching itself like a spring. (Treat this as a charge, even though the thoqqua does not need to move 10 feet before attacking.) 

#### Heat (Ex)
Merely touching or being touched by a thoqqua automatically deals 2d6 fire damage. 

### Burn (Ex)
When a thoqqua hits with its slam attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save or catch fire. The save DC is Constitution-based. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds if not extinguished sooner. A burning creature can use a full-round action to put out the flame.

A titan is about 25 feet tall and weighs about 14,000 pounds. 

Titans speak Abyssal, Common, Celestial, Draconic, and Giant. 

#### Combat

A titan's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

### Oversized Weapon (Ex)
A titan wields a great, two-handed warhammer (big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without penalty. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
 - **At will:** [[3.5 Spell List#Chain Lightning\|Chain Lightning]] (DC 23), [[3.5 Spell List#Charm Monster\|Charm Monster]] (DC 21), [[3.5 Spell List#Cure Critical Wounds\|Cure Critical Wounds]] (DC 21), [[3.5 Spell List#Fire Storm\|Fire Storm]] (DC 24), [[3.5 Spell List#Dispel Magic, Greater\|Dispel Magic, Greater]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Hold Monster\|Hold Monster]] (DC 22), [[3.5 Spell List#Invisibility\|Invisibility]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Invisibility Purge\|Invisibility Purge]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Levitate\|Levitate]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Persistent Image\|Persistent Image]] (DC 22), [[3.5 Spell List#Polymorph\|Polymorph]] (humanoid Forms Only, [[3.5 Spell List#Duration 1 Hour)\|Duration 1 Hour)]] ;

 -  Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

### Tactics Round-by-Round

Titans enjoy combat and usually close with their foes. If that proves ineffective, they swiftly back off and pelt the foe with spell-like abilities and magical effects. Because of a titan's Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat, it can use *chain lightning* as a free action, and frequently attacks in melee while lashing out with this ability at the same time. 

*Prior to combat: Invisibility purge* or *invisibility*. 

*Round 1:* Charge and attempt to sunder the weapon of the most dangerous foe. Hurl *chain lightning* at opponents standing away from the fight. 

*Round 2:* Full attack against the disarmed opponent, and hurl *chain lightning* at other opponents. 

*Round 3:* Back away from first opponent and use *maze* or *meteor swarm* on any spellcaster causing trouble. 

*Round 4:* Sunder the weapon of the next most effective combatant, or use *greater dispel magic* on all nearby opponents. 

*Round 5:* Full attack against any nearby opponent, or use *fire storm*. 

Use another quickened *chain lightning* if foes seem really dangerous. 

A titan usually reserves its *gate* and *etherealness* abilities to escape a fight that is not going well.

A tojanida's shell is blue-green in color. Inside the shell is a fleshy body from which extend seven stalks. Four of these stalks have paddles for locomotion, two are tipped with claws, and one bears the creature's head. Eight vents in the shell, four at each end, allow the tojanida to thrust its stalks out in whatever configuration it finds convenient. 

A juvenile tojanida is up to 25 years old. It has a shell about 3 feet long, and it weighs about 60 pounds. An adult is aged 26 to 80. Its shell is about 6 feet long, and it weighs about 220 pounds. An elder can reach 150 years of age. It has a shell about 9 feet long, and it weighs about 500 pounds. 

Tojanidas speak Aquan and can be loquacious, but usually only on the subject of food. 

#### Combat

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a tojanida must hit with a bite or claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Underwater, a tojanida can tow a grabbed victim of its own size or smaller at its swim speed (but it cannot run). A favorite tactic is to grab a single opponent, then withdraw, hauling the opponent away from its allies. 

#### Ink Cloud (Ex)
A tojanida can emit a spherical cloud of jet-black ink with a radius of 30 feet once per minute as a free action. The effect is otherwise similar to *fog cloud* cast by an individual of a level equal to the tojanida's Hit Dice. Out of water, the ink emerges in a stream up to 30 feet long, which a tojanida can squirt into an opponent's eyes. The affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. The save DC is 13 against a juvenile, 15 against an adult, and 21 against an elder. The save DCs are Constitution based. 

#### All-Around Vision (Ex)
The multiple apertures in a tojanida's shell allow it to look in any direction, bestowing a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks. Opponents gain no flanking bonuses when attacking a tojanida. 

#### Skills
A tojanida has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A treant's leaves are deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant's legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree. 

A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a "trunk" about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds. 

Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Sylvan. Most also can manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid tongues---at least enough to say "Get away from my trees!" 

#### Combat

Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to trample the despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed, they animate trees as reinforcements. 

### *Animate Trees* (Sp)
A treant can animate trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to *liveoak* (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a treant has. 

### Double Damage against Objects (Ex)
A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. 

### Trample (Ex)
Reflex DC 22 half. The save DC is Strength-based. Skills: \*Treants have a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks made in forested areas.

A triton has silvery skin that fades into silver-blue scales on the lower half of its body. A triton's hair is deep blue or blue-green. 

A triton is about the same size and weight as a human. Tritons speak Common and Aquan. 

#### Combat

#### Spell-Like Abilities

A troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. 

Troglodytes speak Draconic. 

#### Combat

Half of a group of troglodytes are armed only with claws and teeth; the rest carry one or two javelins and clubs. They normally conceal themselves, launch a volley of javelins, then close to attack. If the battle goes against them, they retreat and attempt to hide. 

Stench (Ex): When a troglodyte is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musk-like chemical that nearly every form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a troglodyte must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyte's stench for 24 hours. A *delay poison* or *neutralize poison* spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. 

Skills: The skin of a troglodyte changes color somewhat, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings like a chameleon and providing a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. \*In rocky or underground settings, this bonus improves to +8.

Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile. 

A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Females are slightly larger than males. A troll's rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron gray. 

Trolls speak Giant. 

#### Combat

Trolls have no fear of death: They launch themselves into combat without hesitation, flailing wildly at the closest opponent. Even when confronted with fire, they try to get around the flames and attack. 

#### Rend (Ex)
If a troll hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage. 

#### Regeneration (Ex)
Fire and acid deal normal damage to a troll. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump. 

### Scrag

These cousins of the troll have the aquatic subtype. They dwell in any body of water in any climate. They have a base land speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet and are found only in aquatic environments. They regenerate only if mostly immersed in water. 

### Troll Hunter

Some trolls, more cunning than most, are not satisfied with merely eating civilized beings but train to hunt them relentlessly. These troll hunters are fearsome rangers who focus on slaying and devouring humanoid prey. 

#### Combat

A troll hunter makes full use of its scent ability to track its favored enemies and generally prefers to hunt in darkness. 

The troll hunter uses its limited repertoire of spells to protect itself from damaging forms of energy and to immobilize enemies.
