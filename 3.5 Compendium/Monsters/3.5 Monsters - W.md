A wight's appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the form it had in life. A wight is about the height and weight of a human. 

Wights speak Common. 

#### Combat

Wights attack by hammering with their fists. 

#### Create Spawn (Su)
Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. 

#### Energy Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a wight's slam attack gain one negative level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such negative level bestowed, the wight gains 5 temporary hit points.

Will-o'-wisps can be yellow, white, green, or blue. They are easily mistaken for lanterns, especially in the foggy marshes and swamps where they reside. A will-o'-wisp's body is a globe of spongy material about 1 foot across and weighing about 3 pounds, and its glowing body sheds as much light as a torch. 

Will-o'-wisps speak Common and Auran. They have no vocal apparatus but can vibrate to create a voice with a ghostly sound. 

#### Combat

Will-o'-wisps usually avoid combat. They prefer to confuse and bewilder adventurers, luring them into morasses or other hazardous places. When they are forced to fight, they loose small electrical shocks, which act as melee touch attacks. 

#### Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A will-o'-wisp is immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except *magic missile* and *maze.* 

#### Natural Invisibility (Ex)
A startled or frightened will-o'-wisp can extinguish its glow, effectively becoming invisible as the spell.

A typical worg has gray or black fur, grows to 5 feet long and stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder. It weighs 300 pounds. 

More intelligent than their smaller cousins, worgs speak their own language. Some can also speak Common and Goblin. 

#### Combat

Mated pairs or packs work together to bring down large game, while lone worgs usually chase down creatures smaller than themselves. Both often use hit-and-run tactics to exhaust their quarry. A pack usually circles a larger opponent: Each wolf attacks in turn, biting and retreating, until the creature is exhausted, at which point the pack moves in for the kill. If they get impatient or heavily outnumber the opponent, worgs attempt to pin it. 

#### Trip (Ex)
A worg that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the worg. 

#### Skills
A worg has a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks, and a +2 racial bonus on Hide checks. \*A worg has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. In some cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance does not affect the creature's AC or combat abilities but only reflects the shape it had in life. 

A wraith is about as tall as a human, while a dread wraith is roughly the size of an ogre. Since both are incorporeal, they are weightless. 

Wraiths speak Common and Infernal. 

#### Combat

Both the wraith and the dread wraith share the following abilities. 

#### Unnatural Aura (Su)
Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a wraith at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range. 

#### *Daylight* Powerlessness (Ex)
Wraiths are utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a *daylight* spell) and flee from it. 

### Wraith

### Constitution Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a wraith's incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On each such successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. 

#### Create Spawn (Su)
Any humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse and transformed. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. 

### Dread Wraith

The oldest and most malevolent wraiths lurk in the depths of forgotten temples and other forsaken places. They can sense the approach of living creatures, and hunger for them. Despite its size, the dread wraith possesses unearthly quickness, and makes use of its Spring Attack feat and natural reach to strike with deadly effect and melt back into the shadows---or the walls. 

#### Lifesense (Su)
A dread wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast *deathwatch.* 

#### Constitution Drain (Su)
Living creatures hit by a dread wraith's incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On each such successful attack, the dread wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. 

#### Create Spawn (Su)
Any humanoid slain by a dread wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse and transformed. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail. 

A wyvern's body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton. 

Wyverns speak Draconic, but usually don't bother with anything more elaborate than a loud hiss or a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator. 

#### Combat

Wyverns are rather stupid but always aggressive: They attack nearly anything that isn't obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, snatching the opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a wyvern must hit with its talons. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and stings. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Skills
Wyverns have a +3 racial bonus on Spot checks.
