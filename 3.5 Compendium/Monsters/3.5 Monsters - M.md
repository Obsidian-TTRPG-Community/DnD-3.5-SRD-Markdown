Magmins are small, human-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire that radiate intense heat and are wreathed in an aura of searing flames. A typical magmin is 4 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. 

Magmins speak Ignan. 

#### Combat

Although small, magmins are dangerous opponents. Their touch is effective against those who lack protection or immunity from heat and flames, but if faced with opponents who have immunity to fire, magmins rely on their slam attack. In any case, magmins are not valiant fighters. They usually flee if injured, although often only far enough to set up a fiery ambush for their enemies. 

A magmin's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Combustion (Ex)
Anyone a magmin touches must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save or take an extra 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes ignite or armor becomes searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d4+2 rounds after the magmin's last successful attack. Magmins can also ignite flammable materials with a touch. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Fiery Aura (Ex)
Anyone within 20 feet of a magmin must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of heat damage per round from the intense heat. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Melt Weapons (Ex)
Any metal weapon that strikes a magmin must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A medusa is indistinguishable from a normal human at distances greater than 30 feet (or closer, if its face is concealed). The creature often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. 

A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human. 

Medusas speak Common. 

#### Combat

A medusa tries to disguise its true nature until the intended victim is within range of its petrifying gaze, using subterfuge and bluffing games to convince the target that there is no danger. It uses normal weapons to attack those who avert their eyes or survive its gaze, while its poisonous snakes strike at adjacent opponents. 

#### Petrifying Gaze (Su)
Turn to stone permanently, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Poison (Ex)
Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

## Mephit

Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes. 

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance. 

#### Combat

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature. 

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.
### *Summon Mephit* (Sp)
Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a *summon monster* spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. 

#### Fast Healing (Ex)
Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.

A mimic can have almost any dimensions, but usually is not more than 10 feet long. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 4,500 pounds. 

Mimics speak Common. 

#### Combat

A mimic often surprises an unsuspecting adventurer, lashing out with a heavy pseudopod. The creature does not necessarily fight to the death if it can succeed in extorting treasure or food from a party. 

#### Adhesive (Ex)
A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first. 

A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A successful DC 16 Strength check is needed to pry it off. 

Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. 

#### Crush (Ex)
A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check. 

#### Mimic Shape (Ex)
A mimic can assume the general shape of any object that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check opposed by the mimic's Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is generally far too late. 

#### Skills
A mimic has a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks.

#### Natural Cunning (Ex)
Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to *maze* spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.

Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains who died without atoning for their crimes. Most mohrgs are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds. 

#### Combat

Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their fists. They often catch opponents flat-footed, for they move much faster than zombies. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature of its size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 

#### Paralyzing Touch (Su)
A mohrg lashes out with its tongue in combat. An opponent the tongue touches must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Create Spawn (Su)
Creatures killed by a mohrg rise after 1d4 days as zombies under the morhg's control. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Mummies are preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark desert gods best forgotten. 

Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds. 

Mummies can speak Common, but seldom bother to do so. 

#### Combat

#### Despair (Su)
At the mere sight of a mummy, the viewer must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same mummy's despair ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Mummy Rot (Su)
Supernatural disease---slam, Fortitude DC 16, incubation period 1 minute; damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described below. 

Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character attempting to cast any conjuration (healing) spell on a creature afflicted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the afflicted character. 

To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with *break enchantment* or *remove curse* (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell), after which a caster level check is no longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the mummy rot can be magically cured as any normal disease. 

An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand and dust that blow away into nothing at the first wind. 

### Mummy Lord

Unusually powerful or evil individuals preserved as mummies sometimes rise as greater mummies after death. A mummy lord resembles its lesser fellows, but often wears or carries equipment it used in life. 

Mummy lords are often potent spellcasters. They are found as guardians of the tombs of high lords, priests, and mages. Most are sworn to defend for eternity the resting place of those whom they served in life, but in some cases a mummy lord's unliving state is the result of a terrible curse or rite designed to punish treason, infidelity, or crimes of an even more abhorrent nature. A mummy lord of this sort is usually imprisoned in a tomb that is never meant to be opened again. 

#### Despair (Su)
The save DC against this mummy lord's despair is 17. 

#### Mummy Rot (Su)
The save DC against this mummy lord's mummy rot is 17.
