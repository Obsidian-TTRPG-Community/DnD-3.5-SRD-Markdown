A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands are where the backs of the hands would be on a human. 

A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human. 

Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon. 

#### Combat

In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever possible, it uses its other abilities to make such encounters unnecessary. 

#### Detect Thoughts (Su)
A rakshasa can continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based. 

#### Spells
A rakshasa casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.

 - **3rd:** [[3.5 Spell List#Haste\|Haste]] , [[3.5 Spell List#Suggestion\|Suggestion]] ;

### Change Shape (Su)
A rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a rakshasa loses its claw and bite attacks (although it often equips itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form when killed. A *true seeing* spell reveals its natural form. 

#### Skills
A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. \*When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If reading an opponent's mind, its circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by a further +4. 

### Rakshasas as Characters

Rakshasa characters possess the following racial traits.

which provide 7d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +7, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +5, Ref +5, and Will +5. 

- Racial Skills: A rakshasa's outsider levels give it skill points
equal to 10 x (8 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Bluff, Disguise, Listen, Move Silently, Perform, Sense Motive, and Spot. A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks, and it can gain further bonuses by using change shape (+10 on Disguise checks) and detect thoughts (+4 on Bluff and Disguise checks). 

- Racial Feats: A rakshasa's outsider levels give it three feats.

racial spellcasting levels and class levels to determine the abilities of its familiar.

A rast has anywhere from ten to fifteen claws, though it can only use four at once. 

A rast has a body about the size of a large dog's, with a head almost as large as the body. It weighs about 200 pounds. 

#### Combat

Rasts paralyze as many of their foes as possible, then attack any that are still moving. A rast can claw or bite, but cannot do both during the same round.

Paralysis for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

#### Blood Drain (Ex)
A rast drains blood from a grabbed opponent, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round it maintains the hold. 

#### Flight (Su)

Ravids are creatures from the Positive Energy Plane. These bizarre entities imbue creatures with energy by their touch and animate lifeless objects around them. Ravids that make their way to the Material Plane wander about aimlessly, followed by the objects to which they have given life. 

A ravid is about 7 feet long and weighs about 75 pounds. 

#### Combat

Ravids fight only in self-defense. A ravid itself is not very powerful but is always accompanied by at least one animated object that defends it. 

#### Positive Energy Lash (Su)
A ravid can make a touch attack or hit with a claw or tail slap attack to infuse a target with positive energy. The energy produces an unpleasant tingle in living creatures, and against undead foes (even incorporeal ones) it deals 2d10 points of damage. 

Animate Objects (Su): Once per round, a random object within 20 feet of a ravid animates as though by the spell *animate objects* (caster level 20th). These objects defend the ravid to the best of their ability, but the ravid isn't intelligent enough to employ elaborate tactics with them. 

#### Flight (Su)
A ravid can cease or resume flight as a free action. A rast that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action (either a move action or an attack action) each round. 

#### Feats
A ravid has the Multiattack feat even through it does not have the requisite three natural weapons.

A remorhaz is whitish-blue in color but pulses with a reddish glow from the heat its body produces. The creature is a little more than 20 feet long, with a body about 5 feet wide. It weighs about 10,000 pounds. 

Remorhazes cannot speak. 

#### Combat

Remorhazes hide under the snow and ice until they hear movement above them, then attack from below and surprise prey. 

#### Improved Grab (Ex)
To use this ability, a remorhaz must hit an opponent least one size category smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can attempt to swallow the opponent the following round. 

#### Swallow Whole (Ex)
When a remorhaz begins its turn with a grappled opponent in its mouth, it can swallow that opponent with a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus 8d6 points of fire damage per round from the remorhaz's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge remorhaz's interior can hold 2 Large, 4 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or 512 Fine or smaller opponents. 

#### Heat (Ex)
An enraged remorhaz generates heat so intense that anything touching its body takes 8d6 points of fire damage. Creatures striking a remorhaz with natural attacks or unarmed attacks are subject to this damage, but creatures striking with melee weapons do not take damage from the remorhaz's heat. This heat can melt or char weapons; any weapon that strikes a remorhaz is allowed a DC 18 Fortitude save to avoid destruction. The save DC is Constitution-based. Skills: Remorhazes have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.

A roc's plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. These enormous creatures are 30 feet long from the beak to the base of the tail, with wingspans as wide as 80 feet. A roc weighs about 8,000 pounds. 

#### Combat

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any Medium or larger creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings. 

#### Skills
Rocs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A roper stands some 9 feet tall and tapers from 3 or 4 feet in diameter at the base to 1 foot across at the top. It weighs 2,200 pounds. A roper's coloration and temperature change to match the features of the surrounding cave. 

Ropers speak Terran and Undercommon. 

#### Combat

A roper hunts by standing very still and imitating a bit of rock. This tactic often allows it to attack with surprise. When prey comes within reach, it lashes out with its strands. In melee, it bites adjacent opponents with its powerful maw. 

#### Drag (Ex)
If a roper hits with a strand attack, the strand latches onto the opponent's body. This deals no damage but drags the stuck opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which requires a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check. The check DCs are Strength-based, and the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial bonus. A roper can draw in a creature within 10 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in the same round. A strand has 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a roper's strand does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the strand is currently attached to a target, the roper takes a --4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a strand deals no damage to a roper. 

#### Strands (Ex)
Most encounters with a roper begin when it fires strong, sticky strands. The creature can have up to six strands at once, and they can strike up to 50 feet away (no range increment). If a strand is severed, the roper can extrude a new one on its next turn as a free action. 

#### Weakness (Ex)
A roper's strands can sap an opponent's strength. Anyone grabbed by a strand must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

#### Skills
\*Ropers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in stony or icy areas. 

## Rust Monster



|  | Medium Aberration | 
|---|---|
| Hit Dice: | 5d8+5 (27 hp) | 
| Initiative: | +3 | 
| Speed: | 40 ft. (8 squares) | 
| Armor Class: | 18 (+3 Dex, +5 natural), touch 13, flat-footed 15 |

| Environment: | Underground | 
| Organization: | Solitary or pair |

The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust monster's prehensile antennae can rust metals on contact. 

The typical rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high, weighing 200 pounds. 

#### Combat

A rust monster can scent a metal object from up to 90 feet away. When it detects one, it dashes toward the source and attempts to strike it with its antennae. The creature is relentless, chasing characters over long distances if they still possess intact metal objects but usually ceasing its attacks to devour a freshly rusted meal. 

The creature targets the largest metal object available, striking first at armor, then at shields and smaller items. It prefers ferrous metals (steel or iron) over precious metals (such as gold or silver) but will devour the latter if given the opportunity. 

#### Rust (Ex)
A rust monster that makes a successful touch attack with its antennae causes the target metal to corrode, falling to pieces and becoming useless immediately. The touch can destroy up to a 10-foot cube of metal instantly. Magic armor and weapons, and other magic items made of metal, must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or be dissolved. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus. 

A metal weapon that deals damage to a rust monster corrodes immediately. Wooden, stone, and other nonmetallic weapons are unaffected.
