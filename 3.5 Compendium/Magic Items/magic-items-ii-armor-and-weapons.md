## Armor

In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.

Armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.

### Caster Level for Armor and Shields:

The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

### Shields:

Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a bash. The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).

A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.

As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

### Shield Hardness and Hit Points:

Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to a shield’s hardness and +10 to its hit points.

### Activation:

Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields—by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).

### Armor for Unusual Creatures:

The cost of armor for nonhumanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

## Magic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions

Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

### Acid Resistance:

A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a dull gray appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of acid damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +18,000 gp.

### Acid Resistance, Improved:

As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of acid damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +42,000 gp.

### Acid Resistance, Greater:

As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of acid damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +66,000 gp.

### Animated:

Upon command, an animated shield floats within 2 feet of the wielder, protecting her as if she were using it herself but freeing up both her hands. Only one shield can protect a character at a time. A character with an animated shield still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency.

Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _animate objects;_ Price +2 bonus.

### Arrow Catching:

A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield’s wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield’s bearer instead. (If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield’s base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield’s increased AC bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _entropic shield_; Price +1 bonus.

### Arrow Deflection:

This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn’t count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or _acid arrows_, can’t be deflected.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _shield;_ Price +2 bonus.

### Bashing:

A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A bashing shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. (Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.)

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _bull’s strength;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Blinding:

A shield with this ability flashes with a brilliant light up to twice per day upon command of the wielder. Anyone within 20 feet except the wielder must make a DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _searing light;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Cold Resistance:

A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a bluish, icy hue or is adorned with furs and shaggy pelts. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of cold damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +18,000 gp.

### Cold Resistance, Improved:

As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of cold damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +42,000 gp.

### Cold Resistance, Greater:

As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of cold damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +66,000 gp.

### Electricity Resistance:

A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a bluish hue and often bears a storm or lightning motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of electricity damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +18,000 gp.

### Electricity Resistance, Improved:

As electricity resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of electricity damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +42,000 gp.

### Electricity Resistance, Greater:

As electricity resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of electricity damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +66,000 gp.

### Etherealness:

On command, this ability allows the wearer of the armor to become ethereal (as the _ethereal jaunt_ spell) once per day. The character can remain ethereal for as long as desired, but once he returns to normal, he cannot become ethereal again that day.

Strong transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ethereal jaunt;_ Price +49,000 gp.

### Fire Resistance:

A suit of armor with this ability normally has a reddish hue and often is decorated with a draconic motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +18,000 gp.

### Fire Resistance, Improved:

As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of fire damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +42,000 gp.

### Fire Resistance, Greater:

As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 30 points of fire damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +66,000 gp.

### Fortification:

This suit of armor or shield produces a magical force that protects vital areas of the wearer more effectively. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

| Fortification Type | Chance for Normal Damage | Base Price Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light | 25% | +1 bonus |
| Moderate | 75% | +3 bonus |
| Heavy | 100% | +5 bonus |

Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _limited wish_ or _miracle;_ Price varies (see above).

### Ghost Touch:

This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of incorporeal creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by incorporeal creatures at any time. Incorporeal creatures gain the armor or shield’s enhancement bonus against both corporeal and incorporeal attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _etherealness;_ Price +3 bonus.

### Glamered:

A suit of armor with this ability appears normal. Upon command, the armor changes shape and form to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when glamered. Only a _true seeing_ spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _disguise self;_ Price +2,700 gp.

### Invulnerability:

This suit of armor grants the wearer damage reduction of 5/magic.

Strong abjuration and perhaps evocation (if _miracle_ is used); CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _stoneskin, wish_ or _miracle;_ Price +3 bonus.

### Reflecting:

This shield seems like a mirror. Its surface is completely reflective. Once per day, it can be called on to reflect a spell back at its caster exactly like the _spell turning_ spell.

Strong abjuration; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _spell turning;_ Price +5 bonus.

### Shadow:

This armor is jet black and blurs the wearer whenever she tries to hide, granting a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. (The armor’s armor check penalty still applies normally.)

Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _invisibility;_ Price +3,750 gp.

### Shadow, Improved:

As shadow, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Hide checks.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _invisibility;_ Price +15,000 gp.

### Shadow, Greater:

As shadow, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Hide checks.

Moderate illusion; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _invisibility;_ Price +33,750 gp.

### Silent Moves:

This armor is well oiled and magically constructed so that it not only makes little sound, but it dampens sound around it. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer’s Move Silently checks. (The armor’s armor check penalty still applies normally.)

Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _silence;_ Price +3,750 gp.

### Silent Moves, Improved:

As silent moves, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _silence;_ Price +15,000 gp.

### Silent Moves, Greater:

As silent moves, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.

Moderate illusion; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _silence;_ Price +33,750 gp.

### Slick:

Slick armor seems coated at all times with a slightly greasy oil. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer’s Escape Artist checks. (The armor’s armor check penalty still applies normally.)

Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _grease;_ Price +3,750 gp.

### Slick, Improved:

As slick, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.

Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _grease;_ Price +15,000 gp.

### Slick, Greater:

As slick, except it grants a +15 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.

Moderate conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _grease;_ Price +33,750 gp.

### Sonic Resistance:

A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally has a glistening appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of sonic damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +18,000 gp.

### Sonic Resistance, Improved:

As sonic resistance, except it absorbs the first 20 points of sonic damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +42,000 gp.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _resist energy;_ Price +66,000 gp.

### Spell Resistance:

This property grants the armor’s wearer spell resistance while the armor is worn. The spell resistance can be 13, 15, 17, or 19, depending on the armor.

Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _spell resistance;_ Price +2 bonus (SR 13), +3 bonus (SR 15), +4 bonus (SR 17), or +5 bonus (SR 19).

### Undead Controlling:

The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this property may control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the _control undead_ spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _control undead_; Price +49,000 gp.

### Wild:

The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this ability preserves his armor bonus (and any enhancement bonus) while in a wild shape. Armor and shields with this ability usually appear to be made covered in leaf patterns. While the wearer is in a wild shape, the armor cannot be seen.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _baleful polymorph_; Price +3 bonus.

## Specific Armors

The following specific suits of armor usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities described here.

### Adamantine Breastplate:

This nonmagical breastplate is made of adamantine, giving its wearer damage reduction of 2/–.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 10,200 gp.

### Banded Mail of Luck:

Ten 100-gp gems adorn this _+3 banded mail._ Once per week, the armor allows its wearer to require that an attack roll made against him be rerolled. He must take whatever consequences come from the second roll. The wearer’s player must decide whether to have the attack roll rerolled before damage is rolled.

Strong enchantment; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _bless;_ Price 18,900 gp; Cost 10,150 gp + 700 XP.

### Breastplate of Command:

This finely crafted _+2 breastplate_ radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including turning checks and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal herself in any way and still have the effect function.

Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _mass charm monster;_ Price 25,400 gp; Cost 10,975 gp + 850 XP.

### Celestial Armor:

This bright silver or gold _+3 chainmail_ is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence.

It is considered light armor, weighs 20 pounds, and it allows the wearer to use _fly_ on command (as the spell) once per day.

### Demon Armor:

This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This _+4 full plate_ allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a _contagion_ spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of _contagion_ requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The “claws” are built into the armor’s vambraces and gauntlets.

The armor bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the armor is worn.

Strong necromancy \[[#evil\]]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _contagion;_ Price 52,260 gp; Cost 26,130 gp + 2,090 XP.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 16,500 gp.

### Specific Shields

Experience point and component costs remain the same. The strip cannot accommodate spells of higher than 3rd level. The strip is reusable.

A random _caster ’s shield_ has a 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01–80 on d%) or arcane (81–100).

A _caster’s shield_ has a 5% arcane spell failure chance.

Moderate abjuration; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Scribe Scroll, creator must be at least 6th level; Price 3,153 gp (plus the value of the scroll spell if one is currently scribed); Cost 1,653 gp + 120 XP.

### Darkwood Buckler:

No aura (nonmagical); Price 205 gp.

### Darkwood Shield:

This nonmagical heavy wooden shield is made out of darkwood. It has no enhancement bonus, but its construction material makes it lighter than a normal wooden shield.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 1,020 gp.

### Spined Shield:

This _+1 heavy steel shield_ is covered in spines. It acts as a normal spiked shield. On command up to three times per day, the shield’s wearer can fire one of the shield’s spines. A fired spine has a +1 enhancement bonus, a range increment of 120 feet, and deals 1d10 points of damage (19–20/x2). Fired spines regenerate each day.

Moderate evocation; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _magic missile;_ Price 5,580 gp; Cost 2,740 gp + 223 XP.

## Weapons

Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

A weapon or a kind of ammunition may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.

### Caster Level for Weapons:

The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

### Additional Damage Dice:

Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.

### Ranged Weapons and Ammunition:

The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).

### Magic Ammunition and Breakage:

When a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, or sling bullet misses its target, there is a 50% chance it breaks or otherwise is rendered useless. A magic arrow, bolt, or bullet that hits is destroyed.

### Light Generation:

Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a _light_ spell (bright light in a 20-foot radius, shadowy light in a 40-foot radius). These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can’t be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.

### Hardness and Hit Points:

An attacker cannot damage a magic weapon that has an enhancement bonus unless his own weapon has at least as high an enhancement bonus as the weapon or shield struck. Each +1 of enhancement bonus also adds 1 to the weapon’s or shield’s hardness and hit points.

### Activation:

Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action).

### Magic Weapons and Critical Hits:

Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect functions against creatures not subject to critical hits, such as undead, elementals, and constructs. When fighting against such creatures, roll for critical hits as you would against humanoids or any other creature subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon’s regular damage.

### Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures:

The cost of weapons for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

### Special Qualities:

Roll d%. If the item is a melee weapon, a 01–30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31–45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon’s function, and 46–100 indicates no special qualities.

If the item is a ranged weapon, a 01–15 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon’s function, and 16–100 indicates no special qualities.

## Magic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions

In addition to enhancement bonuses, weapons can have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

### Anarchic:

An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of lawful alignment. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the chaotic power upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation \[[#chaotic\]]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _chaos hammer,_ creator must be chaotic; Price +2 bonus.

### Axiomatic:

An axiomatic weapon is lawfully aligned and infused with the power of law. It makes the weapon law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of chaotic alignment. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation \[[#lawful\]]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _order’s wrath,_ creator must be lawful; Price +2 bonus.

### Bane:

A bane weapon excels at attacking one type or subtype of creature. Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +2 better than its normal enhancement bonus. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against the foe. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the bane quality upon their ammunition. To randomly determine a weapon’s designated foe, roll on the following table.

| d%  | Designated Foe |
| --- | --- |
| 01–05 | Aberrations |
| 06–09 | Animals |
| 10–16 | Constructs |
| 17–22 | Dragons |

| 85–87 | Outsiders, lawful |

| 89–90 | Plants |
| 91–98 | Undead |
| 99–100 | Vermin |

Moderate conjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _summon monster I_; Price +1 bonus.

### Brilliant Energy:

A brilliant energy weapon has its significant portion transformed into light, although this does not modify the item’s weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects. This property can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons, and ammunition.

Strong transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _gaseous form, continual flame;_ Price +4 bonus.

### Dancing:

As a standard action, a dancing weapon can be loosed to attack on its own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed it and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and the person who activated it is not considered armed with the weapon. In all other respects, it is considered wielded or attended by the creature for all maneuvers and effects that target items. While dancing, it takes up the same space as the activating character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action; when so retrieved the weapon can’t dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _animate objects;_ Price +4 bonus.

### Defending:

A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the sword’s enhancement bonus to his AC as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon’s enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect to AC lasts until his next turn.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _shield_ or _shield of faith;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Disruption:

A weapon of disruption is the bane of all undead. Any undead creature struck in combat must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be destroyed. A weapon of disruption must be a bludgeoning weapon. (If you roll this property randomly for a piercing or slashing weapon, reroll.)

Strong conjuration; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _heal;_ Price +2 bonus.

### Distance:

This property can only be placed on a ranged weapon. A weapon of distance has double the range increment of other weapons of its kind.

Moderate divination; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _clairaudience/clairvoyance;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Flaming:

Upon command, a flaming weapon is sheathed in fire. The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A flaming weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor and _flame blade, flame strike,_ or _fireball;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Flaming Burst:

A flaming burst weapon functions as a flaming weapon that also explodes with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the flaming ability (see above), a flaming burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points of fire damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.

Even if the flaming ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit.

Strong evocation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor and _flame blade, flame strike,_ or _fireball;_ Price +2 bonus.

### Frost:

Upon command, a frost weapon is sheathed in icy cold. The cold does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A frost weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _chill metal_ or _ice storm;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Ghost Touch:

A ghost touch weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus. (An incorporeal creature’s 50% chance to avoid damage does not apply to attacks with ghost touch weapons.) The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a ghost touch weapon counts as either corporeal or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is more beneficial to the wielder.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _plane shift;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Holy:

A holy weapon is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of evil alignment. It bestows one negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the holy power upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation \[[#good\]]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _holy smite,_ creator must be good; Price +2 bonus.

### Icy Burst:

An icy burst weapon functions as a frost weapon that also explodes with frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the frost ability, an icy burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition.

Even if the frost ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical hit.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _chill metal_ or _ice storm;_ Price +2 bonus.

### Keen:

This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or slashing weapons can be keen. (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.) This benefit doesn’t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon (such as the _keen edge_ spell or the Improved Critical feat).

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _keen edge;_ Price +1 bonus.

### _Ki_ Focus:

The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder’s _ki_, allowing her to use her special _ki_ attacks through the weapon as if they were unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk’s stunning attack, _ki_ strike, and quivering palm, as well as the Stunning Fist feat. Only melee weapons can have the _ki_ focus ability.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a monk; Price +1 bonus.

### Merciful:

The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, and all damage it deals is nonlethal damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until commanded to resume it. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the merciful effect upon their ammunition.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _cure light wounds_; Price +1 bonus.

### Mighty Cleaving:

A mighty cleaving weapon allows a wielder with the Cleave feat to make one additional cleave attempt in a round.

Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _divine power;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Returning:

This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. A returning weapon flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the thrower just before the creature’s next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).

Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free action. If the character can’t catch it, or if the character has moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _telekinesis;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Seeking:

Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.)

Strong divination; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _true seeing_; Price +1 bonus.

### Shock:

Upon command, a shock weapon is sheathed in crackling electricity. The electricity does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A shock weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _call lightning_ or _lightning bolt;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Shocking Burst:

A shocking burst weapon functions as a shock weapon that also explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the shock ability, a shocking burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition.

Even if the shock ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra electricity damage on a successful critical hit.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _call lightning_ or _lightning bolt;_ Price +2 bonus.

### Speed:

When making a full attack action, the wielder of a speed weapon may make one extra attack with it. The attack uses the wielder’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a _haste_ spell.)

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _haste;_ Price +3 bonus.

### Spell Storing:

A spell storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Any time the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled spell storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a spell stored in it already.

Strong evocation (plus aura of stored spell); CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a caster of at least 12th level; Price +1 bonus.

### Thundering:

A thundering weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder upon striking a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not harm the wielder. A thundering weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d8 points of sonic damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d8 points of sonic damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the sonic energy upon their ammunition. Subjects dealt a critical hit by a thundering weapon must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be deafened permanently.

Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _blindness/deafness;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Throwing:

This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A melee weapon crafted with this ability gains a range increment of 10 feet and can be thrown by a wielder proficient in its normal use.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _magic stone;_ Price +1 bonus.

### Unholy:

An unholy weapon is imbued with unholy power. This power makes the weapon evil-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of good alignment. It bestows one negative level on any good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation \[[#evil\]]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _unholy blight,_ creator must be evil; Price +2 bonus.

### Vicious:

When a vicious weapon strikes an opponent, it creates a flash of disruptive energy that resonates between the opponent and the wielder. This energy deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to the opponent and 1d6 points of damage to the wielder. Only melee weapons can be vicious.

Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _enervation_; Price +1 bonus.

### Vorpal:

This potent and feared ability allows the weapon to sever the heads of those it strikes. Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a successful roll to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the opponent’s head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. A vorpal weapon must be a slashing weapon. (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.)

Strong necromancy and transmutation; CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _circle of death_, _keen edge;_ Price +5 bonus.

### Wounding:

A wounding weapon deals 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss when it hits a creature. A critical hit does not multiply the Constitution damage. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by this weapon.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _mage’s sword;_ Price +2 bonus.

## Specific Weapons

The following specific weapons usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities described here.

### Adamantine Battleaxe:

No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,010 gp.

### Adamantine Dagger:

This nonmagical dagger is made out of adamantine. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,002 gp.

### Assassin’s Dagger:

This wicked-looking, curved _+2 dagger_ provides a +1 bonus to the DC of a Fortitude save forced by the death attack of an assassin.

Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _slay living;_ Price 18,302 gp; Cost 9,302 gp + 720 XP.

### Dagger of Venom:

This black _+1 dagger_ has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a _poison_ effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the _poison_ effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.

Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _poison;_ Price 8,302 gp; Cost 4,302 gp + 320 XP.

### Dwarven Thrower:

This weapon commonly functions as a _+2 warhammer._ In the hands of a dwarf, the warhammer gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus (for a total enhancement bonus of +3) and gains the returning special ability. It can be hurled with a 30-foot range increment. When hurled, it deals an extra 2d8 points of damage against giants or an extra 1d8 points of damage against any other target.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a dwarf of at least 10th level; Price 60,312 gp; Cost 30,312 gp + 2,400 XP.

### Flame Tongue:

This is a _+1 flaming burst longsword._ Once per day, the sword can blast forth a fiery ray at any target within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The ray deals 4d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit.

Moderate evocation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _scorching ray,_ and _flame blade, flame strike,_ or _fireball;_ Price 20,715 gp; Cost 10,515 gp + 816 XP.

### Frost Brand:

This _+3 frost greatsword_ sheds light as a torch when the temperature drops below 0°F. At such times it cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.

A _frost brand_ extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. As a standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.

Strong evocation; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ice storm, dispel magic, protection from energy;_ Price 54,475 gp; Cost 27,375 gp and 5 sp + 2179 XP.

### Holy Avenger:

This _+2 cold iron longsword_ becomes a _+5 holy cold iron longsword_ in the hands of a paladin.

It provides spell resistance of 5 + the paladin’s level to the wielder and anyone adjacent to her. It also enables the wielder to use _greater dispel magic_ (once per round as a standard action) at the class level of the paladin. (Only the area dispel is possible, not the targeted dispel or counterspell versions of _greater dispel magic._)

Strong abjuration; CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _holy aura,_ creator must be good; Price 120,630 gp; Cost 60,630 gp + 4,800 XP.

### Javelin of Lightning:

This javelin becomes a 5d6 _lightning bolt_ when thrown (Reflex DC 14 half ). It is consumed in the attack.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _lightning bolt;_ Price 1,500 gp; Cost 750 gp + 30 XP.

### Life-Drinker:

This _+1 greataxe_ is favored by undead and constructs, who do not suffer its drawback. A _life-drinker_ bestows two negative levels on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had been struck by an undead creature. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.

Each time a _life-drinker_ deals damage to a foe, it also bestows one negative level on the wielder. Any negative level gained by the wielder in this fashion lasts for 1 hour.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _enervation;_ Price 40,320 gp; Cost 20,320 gp + 1,600 XP.

### Luck Blade:

This _+2 short sword_ gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its possessor to reroll one roll that she just made. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll. In addition, a _luck blade_ may contain up to three _wishes_ (when randomly rolled, a _luck blade_ holds 1d4–1 _wishes,_ minimum 0). When the last _wish_ is used, the sword remains a _+2 short sword,_ still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its reroll power.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _wish_ or _miracle;_ Price 22,060 gp (0 _wishes_), 62,360 gp (1 _wish_), 102,660 gp (2 _wishes_), 142,960 gp (3 _wishes_); Cost 11,030 gp + 882 XP (0 _wishes_), 31,180 gp + 2,494 XP (1 _wish_); 51,330 gp + 4,106 XP (2 _wishes_), 71,480 gp + 5,718 XP (3 _wishes_).

### Mace of Smiting:

This _+3 adamantine heavy mace_ has a +5 enhancement bonus against constructs, and any critical hit dealt to a construct completely destroys it (no saving throw). A critical hit dealt to an outsider deals x4 damage rather than x2.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _disintegrate;_ Price 75,312 gp; Cost 39,312 gp + 2,880 XP.

### Mace of Terror:

On command, this _+2 heavy mace_ causes the wielder’s clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become panicked as if by a _fear_ spell (Will DC 16 partial). They take a –2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _fear;_ Price 38,552 gp; Cost 19,276 gp + 1,542 XP.

### Masterwork Cold Iron Longsword:

This nonmagical longsword is crafted out of cold iron. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 330 gp.

### Nine Lives Stealer:

This longsword always performs as a _+2 longsword,_ but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple _+2 longsword_ (with a hint of evil about it). A critical hit must be dealt for the sword’s death-dealing ability to function, and this weapon has no effect on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the sword’s death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the sword is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the sword is wielded.

Strong necromancy \[[#evil\]]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _finger of death;_ Price 23,057 gp; Cost 11,528 gp 5 sp + 922 XP.

### Oathbow:

Of elven make, this white _+2 composite longbow_ (+2 Str bonus) whispers “Swift defeat to my enemies” in Elven when nocked and pulled. Once per day, if the firer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow’s whisper becomes the low shout “Swift death to those who have wronged me.” Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and x4 on a critical hit instead of the normal x3). However, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the wielder takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the _oathbow._ These bonuses and penalties last for seven days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the _oathbow,_ whichever comes first.

The _oathbow_ may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or seven days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the _oathbow_’s special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be an elf; Price 25,600 gp; Cost 13,100 gp + 1,000 XP.

### Rapier of Puncturing:

Three times per day, this _+2 wounding rapier_ allows the wielder to make a touch attack with the weapon that deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage by draining blood. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by this weapon.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _harm;_ Price 50,320 gp; Cost 25,320 gp + 2,000 XP.

### Screaming Bolt:

One of these _+2 bolts_ screams when fired, forcing all enemies of the wielder within 20 feet of the path of the bolt to succeed on a DC 14 Will save or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _doom;_ Price 267gp; Cost 128 gp and 5 sp + 10 XP.

### Shatterspike:

Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use _Shatterspike_ as a _+1 longsword_ only; wielders with the Improved Sunder feat add a +4 bonus (including the sword’s +1 enhancement bonus) to the opposed roll when attempting to strike a foe’s weapon. If successful, _Shatterspike_ deals 1d8+4 points of damage plus the wielder’s Strength modifier to the target weapon (the target weapon’s hardness must still be overcome with each hit). _Shatterspike_ can damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower.

Strong evocation; CL 13th; Str 13, Craft Arms and Armor, Power Attack, Improved Sunder, _shatter_; Price 4,315 gp; Cost 2,315 gp + 160 XP; Weight 4 lb.

### Shifter’s Sorrow:

This _+1/+1 two-bladed sword_ has blades of alchemical silver. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against any creature with the shapechanger subtype. When a shapechanger or a creature in an alternate form (such as a druid using wild shape) is struck by the weapon, it must make a DC 15 Will save or return to its natural form.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Arms and Armor, _baleful polymorph;_ Price 12,780 gp; Cost 6,780 gp + 480 XP; Weight 10 lb.

### Silver Dagger, Masterwork:

This masterwork alchemical silver dagger is nonmagical. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 322 gp.

### Slaying Arrow:

This _+1 arrow_ is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or die (or, in the case of unliving targets, be destroyed) instantly. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus _death ward_ protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.

A _greater slaying arrow_ functions just like a normal _slaying arrow,_ but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _finger of death_ (_slaying arrow_) or heightened _finger of death_ (_greater slaying arrow_); Price 2,282 gp (_slaying arrow_) or 4,057 gp (_greater slaying arrow_); Cost 1,144 gp 5 sp + 91 XP (_slaying arrow_) or 2,032 gp + 162 XP (_greater slaying arrow_).

### Sleep Arrow:

This _+1 arrow_ is painted white and has white fletching. If it strikes a foe so that it would normally deal damage, it instead bursts into magical energy that deals nonlethal damage (in the same amount as would be lethal damage) and forces the target to make a DC 11 Will save or fall asleep.

Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _sleep;_ Price 132 gp; Cost 69 gp 5 sp + 5 XP.

### Sun Blade:

This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a _sun blade_ is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a _sun blade._ Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.

In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a _+2 bastard sword._ Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2).

The blade also has a special _sunlight_ power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above her head while speaking a command word. The _sunblade_ then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All _sun blades_ are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the sword is wielded.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _daylight,_ creator must be good; Price 50,335 gp; Cost 25,335 gp + 2,000 XP.

### Sword of Life Stealing:

This black iron _+2 longsword_ bestows a negative level when it deals a critical hit. The sword wielder gains 1d6 temporary hit points each time a negative level is bestowed on another. These temporary hit points last for 24 hours. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.

Strong necromancy; CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _enervation;_ Price 25,715 gp; Cost 12,857 gp and 5 sp + 1,029 XP.

### Sword of the Planes:

This longsword has an enhancement bonus of +1 on the Material Plane, but on any Elemental Plane its enhancement bonus increases to +2. (The +2 enhancement bonus also applies on the Material Plane when the weapon is used against elementals.) It operates as a _+3 longsword_ on the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane or when used against opponents native to either of those planes. On any other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a _+4 longsword._

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _plane shift;_ Price 22,315 gp; Cost 11,157 gp and 5 sp + 893 XP.

### Sword of Subtlety:

A _+1 short sword_ with a thin, dull gray blade, this weapon provides a +4 bonus on its wielder’s attack and damage rolls when he is making a sneak attack with it.

Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _blur;_ Price 22,310 gp; Cost 11,155 gp + 892 XP.

### Sylvan Scimitar:

This _+3 scimitar,_ when used outdoors in a temperate climate, grants its wielder the use of the Cleave feat and deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.

Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _divine power_ or creator must be a 7th-level druid; Price 47,315gp; Cost 23,657 gp and 5 sp + 1,893 XP.

### Trident of Fish Command:

The magical properties of this _+1 trident_ with a 6-foot-long haft enable its wielder to _charm_ up to 14 HD of aquatic animals (Will DC 16 negates, animals get a +5 bonus if currently under attack by the wielder or his allies), no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can communicate with the animals as if using a _speak with animals_ spell. Animals making their saving throw are free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the trident. The trident can be used up to three times per day.

Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _speak with animals;_ Price 18,650 gp; Cost 9,325 gp + 746 XP.

### Trident of Warning:

A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine the location, depth, kind, and number of aquatic predators within 680 feet. A _trident of warning_ must be grasped and pointed in order for the character using it to gain such information, and it requires 1 round to scan a hemisphere with a radius of 680 feet. The weapon is otherwise a _+2 trident._

Moderate divination; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _locate creature;_ Price 10,115 gp; Cost 5,057 gp and 5 sp + 405 XP.
