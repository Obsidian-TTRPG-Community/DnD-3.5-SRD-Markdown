## Wondrous Items

This is a catch-all category for anything that doesn’t fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).

#### Physical Description:

Varies.

#### Activation:

Usually use activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.

#### Special Qualities:

Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.

Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.

## Wondrous Item Descriptions

Standard wondrous items are described below.

#### Amulet of Health:

This amulet is a golden disk on a chain. It usually bears the image of a lion or other powerful animal. The amulet grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to Constitution of +2, +4, or +6.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _bear’s endurance;_ Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).

#### Amulet of Mighty Fists:

This amulet grants an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls with unarmed attacks and natural weapons.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _greater magic fang_, creator’s caster level must be at least three times the amulet’s bonus; Price 6,000 gp (+1), 24,000 gp (+2), 54,000 gp (+3), 96,000 gp (+4), 150,000 gp (+5).

#### Amulet of Natural Armor:

This amulet, usually crafted from bone or beast scales, toughens the wearer’s body and flesh, giving him an enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus of from +1 to +5, depending on the kind of amulet.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _barkskin,_ creator’s caster level must be at least three times the amulet’s bonus; Price 2,000 gp (+1), 8,000 gp (+2), 18,000 gp (+3), 32,000 gp (+4), or 50,000 gp (+5).

#### Amulet of the Planes:

This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize _plane shift_. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling with her to a random location on that plane (01–60 on d%) or to a random plane (61–100).

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _plane shift;_ Price 120,000 gp.

#### Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location:

This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a _nondetection_ spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had cast _nondetection_ on herself ).

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _nondetection;_ Price 35,000 gp.

#### Apparatus of the Crab:

This item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate) that opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers: The device has the following characteristics: hp 200; hardness 15; Spd 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (–1 size, +11 natural); Atk +12 melee (2d8, 2 pincers).

| 3   | Uncover/cover side portholes |

Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two Medium characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.

Strong evocation and transmutation; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects_, _continual flame_, creator must have 8 ranks in the Knowledge (architecture and engineering) skill; Price 90,000 gp;_Weight_ 500 lb.

#### Bag of Holding:

This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The _bag of holding_ opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag’s contents, depend on the bag’s type, as shown on the table below.

| Bag | Bag Weight | Contents Weight Limit | Contents Volume Limit | Market Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type I | 15 lb. | 250 lb. | 30 cu. ft. | 2,500 gp |
| Type II | 25 lb. | 500 lb. | 70 cu. ft. | 5,000 gp |
| Type III | 35 lb. | 1,000 lb. | 150 cu. ft. | 7,400 gp |
| Type IV | 60 lb. | 1,500 lb. | 250 cu. ft. | 10,000 gp |

If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a _bag of holding_ is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a _bag of holding_ is a move action—unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.

If a _bag of holding_ is placed within a _portable hole_ a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a _portable hole_ is placed within a _bag of holding,_ it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the _portable hole_ and _bag of holding_ in the process.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _secret chest._

#### Bag of Tricks:

This small sack appears normal and empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of a _bag of tricks_ produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.

The heavy warhorse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.

Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to ten animals can be drawn from the bag each week.

Faint or moderate conjuration; CL 3rd (gray), 5th (rust), 9th (tan); Craft Wondrous Item, _summon nature’s ally II_ (gray), _summon nature’s ally III_ (rust), or _summon nature’s ally_ V (tan); Price 900 gp (gray); 3,000 gp (rust); 6,300 gp (tan).

| _Gray_ |     | _Rust_ |     | _Tan_ |     |

#### Bead of Force:

This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. You can throw it up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.

It functions like a _resilient sphere_ spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell’s duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a _rod of cancellation,_ a _rod of negation, disintegrate,_ or a targeted _dispel magic_ spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _resilient sphere;_ Price 3,000 gp.

#### Belt, Monk’s:

This simple rope belt, when wrapped around a character’s waist, confers great ability in unarmed combat. The wearer’s AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the belt lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk. This AC bonus functions just like the monk’s AC bonus.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _righteous might_ or _transformation;_ Price 13,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Belt of Dwarvenkind:

This belt gives the wearer a +4 competence bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks as they relate to dealing with dwarves, a +2 competence bonus on similar checks when dealing with gnomes and halflings, and a –2 competence penalty on similar checks when dealing with anyone else. The wearer can understand, speak, and read Dwarven. If the wearer is not a dwarf, he gains 60-foot darkvision, dwarven stonecunning, a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against poison, spells, or spell-like effects.

Moderate divination; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, _tongues_, creator must be a dwarf; Price 14,900 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Belt of Giant Strength:

This wide belt is made of thick leather and studded with iron. The belt adds to the wearer’s Strength score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +4 or +6.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _bull’s strength;_ Price 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6);Weight 1 lb.

#### Blessed Book:

This well-made tome is always of small size, typically no more than 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. All such books are durable, waterproof, bound with iron overlaid with silver, and locked.

A wizard can fill the 1,000 pages of a _blessed book_ with spells without paying the 100 gp per page material cost. This book is never found as randomly generated treasure with spells already inscribed in it.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _secret page;_ Price 12,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Boat, Folding:

A folding boat looks like a small wooden box—about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It can be used to store items like any other box. If a command word is given, however, the box unfolds itself to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold to a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.

In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries fifteen with ease.

A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again.

Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fabricate_, creator must have 2 ranks in the Craft (shipmaking) skill; Price 7,200 gp;Weight 4 lb.

#### Boots of Elvenkind:

These soft boots enable the wearer to move quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a +5 competence bonus on Move Silently checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be an elf; Price 2,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Boots of Levitation:

On command, these leather boots allow the wearer to levitate as if she had cast _levitate_ on herself.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _levitate;_ Price 7,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Boots of Speed:

As a free action, the wearer can click her boot heels together, enabling her to act as though affected by a _haste_ spell for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the _haste_ effect need not be consecutive rounds.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _haste;_ Price 12,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Boots of Striding and Springing:

These boots increase the wearer’s base land speed by 10 feet. In addition to this striding ability (considered an enhancement bonus), these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. She can jump with a +5 competence bonus on Jump checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _longstrider_, creator must have 5 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 5,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Boots of Teleportation:

Any character wearing this footwear may _teleport_ three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _teleport;_ Price 49,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Boots of the Winterlands:

This footgear bestows many powers upon the wearer. First, he is able to travel across snow at his normal speed, leaving no tracks. The boots also enable him to travel at normal speed across the most slippery ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or sharply slanted ones) without falling or slipping. Finally, _boots of the winterlands_ warm the wearer, as if he were affected by an _endure elements_ spell.

Faint abjuration and transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _cat’s grace, endure elements, pass without trace;_ Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Boots, Winged:

These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. On command, the boots sprout wings at the heel and let the wearer fly, without having to maintain concentration, as if affected by a _fly_ spell. He can fly three times day for up to 5 minutes per flight.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fly;_ Price 16,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Bottle of Air:

This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. When taken to any airless environment it retains air within it at all times, continually renewing its contents. This means that a character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can then act for as long as she can hold her breath.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _water breathing;_ Price 7,250 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals:

This large container is usually fashioned from blue or green semiprecious stone. It is about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a Large water elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the bowl functions as the _summon monster VI_ spell. Only one elemental can be called at a time. A new elemental requires the bowl to be filled with new water, which cannot happen until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

If salt water is used, the elemental is Huge rather than Large (as if _summon monster VII_ had been cast).

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _summon monster VI, summon monster VII;_ Price 100,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.

#### Bracelet of Friends:

This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon it when created. The owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to one charm. (This designation takes a standard action, but once done it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the spot (a standard action) along with his or her gear, as long as the owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is calling, and the _bracelet of friends_ only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm.

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _refuge;_ Price 19,000 gp.

#### Bracers of Archery, Greater:

These wristbands look like normal protective wear. The bracers empower the wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if she were proficient in its use. If she already has proficiency with any type of bow, she gains a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls whenever using that type of bow. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price 25,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Bracers of Archery, Lesser:

These wristbands function as _greater bracers of archery_, except that they grant a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and no bonus on damage rolls.

Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price 5,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Bracers of Armor:

These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. They surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting him an armor bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _mage armor_, creator’s caster level must be at least two times that of the bonus placed in the bracers; Price 1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5), 36,000 gp (+6), 49,000 gp (+7), 64,000 gp (+8);Weight 1 lb.

#### Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals:

This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a Large fire elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the brazier functions as the _summon monster VI_ spell. If brimstone is added, the elemental is Huge instead of Large, and the brazier works as a _summon monster_ VII spell. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new fire, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _summon monster VI, summon monster VII;_ Price 100,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.

#### Brooch of Shielding:

This appears to be a piece of silver or gold jewelry used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this mundane task, it can absorb _magic missiles_ of the sort generated by spell or spell-like ability. A brooch can absorb up to 101 points of damage from _magic missiles_ before it melts and becomes useless.

Faint abjuration; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, _shield;_ Price 1,500 gp.

#### Broom of Flying:

This broom is able to fly through the air as if affected by_an overland flight_ spell (average maneuverability) for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as she has a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when she speaks the command word. The _broom of flying_ has a speed of 40 feet when it has no rider.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _overland flight, permanency;_ Price 17,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Candle of Invocation:

Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of the nine alignments. Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual so doing if the candle’s alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame.

A cleric whose alignment matches the candle’s operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours.

In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a _gate_ spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn’t interfere with its magical properties.

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, _gate,_ creator must be same alignment as candle created; Price 8,400 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

#### Candle of Truth:

This white tallow candle, when burned, calls into place a _zone of truth_ spell (Will DC 13 negates) in a 5-foot radius centered on the candle. The zone lasts for 1 hour, as the candle burns. If the candle is snuffed before that time, the effect is canceled and the candle ruined.

Faint enchantment; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _zone of truth;_ Price 2,500 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

#### Cape of the Mountebank:

On command, this bright red and gold cape allows the wearer to use the magic of the _dimension door_ spell once per day. When he disappears, he leaves behind a cloud of smoke, appearing in a similar fashion at his destination.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _dimension door;_ Price 10,080 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Carpet of Flying:

This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an _overland flight_ spell of unlimited duration. The size, carrying capacity, and speed of the different _carpets of flying_ are shown on the table below. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.

| Size | Capacity | Speed | Weight | Market Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 ft. by 5 ft. | 200 lb. | 40 ft. | 8 lb. | 20,000 gp |
| 5 ft. by 10 ft. | 400 lb. | 40 ft. | 15 lb. | 35,000 gp |
| 10 ft. by 10 ft. | 800 lb. | 40 ft. | 10 lb. | 60,000 gp |

A _carpet of flying_ can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It has average maneuverability, but a _carpet of flying_ can still hover.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _overland flight_, _permanency_.

#### Censer of Controlling Air Elementals:

This 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth a Large air elemental. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the censer functions as the _summon monster VI_ spell. If _incense of meditation_ is burned within the censer, the air elemental is an elder air elemental instead (as if _summon monster IX_ had just been cast). Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new piece of incense, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, _summon monster VI, summon monster IX;_ Price 100,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Chaos Diamond:

This lustrous gemstone is uncut and about the size of a human fist. The gem grants its possessor the following powers:

*   _Confusion, lesser_
*   _Magic circle against law_
*   _Word of chaos_
*   _Cloak of chaos_

Each power is usable 1d4 times per day. This is rolled for each power individually and the character does not

A nonchaotic character who possesses a _chaos diamond_ gains one negative level. Although this level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the diamond is in the character’s possession and cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells).

Strong varied; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, _cloak of chaos, magic circle against law, random action, word of chaos,_ creator must be chaotic; Price 160,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Chime of Interruption:

This instrument can be struck once every 10 minutes, and its resonant tone lasts for 3 full minutes.

While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a verbal component can be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster can make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the spell’s level).

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _shout;_ Price 16,800 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Chime of Opening:

A _chime of opening_ is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A _chime of opening_ also automatically dispels a _hold portal_ spell or even an _arcane lock_ cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.

The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and _arcane locked,_ it takes four uses of a _chime of opening_ to get it open. A _silence_ spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of ten times before it cracks and becomes useless.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _knock;_ Price 3,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Circlet of Blasting, Minor:

On command, this simple golden headband projects a blast of _searing light_ (3d8 points of damage) once per day.

Faint evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _searing light;_ Price 6,480 gp.

#### Circlet of Blasting, Major:

On command, this elaborate golden headband projects a blast of _searing light_ (5d8 maximized for 40 points of damage) once per day.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell, _searing light;_ Price 23,760 gp.

#### Circlet of Persuasion:

This silver headband grants a +3 competence bonus on the wearer’s Charisma-based checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _eagle’s splendor;_ Price 4,500 gp.

#### Cloak of Arachnida:

This black garment, embroidered with a weblike pattern in silk, gives the wearer the ability to climb as if a _spider climb_ spell had been placed upon her. In addition, the cloak grants her immunity to entrapment by _web_ spells or webs of any sort—she can actually move in webs at half her normal speed. Once per day, the wearer of this cloak can cast _web_. She also gains a +2 luck bonus on all Fortitude saves against poison from spiders.

Faint conjuration and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _spider climb, web;_ Price 14,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Cloak of the Bat:

Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, this cloak bestows a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. The wearer is also able to hang upside down from the ceiling, like a bat.

By holding the edges of the garment, the wearer is able to _fly_ as per the spell. If he desires, the wearer can actually polymorph himself into an ordinary bat and fly accordingly. (All possessions worn or carried are part of the transformation.) Flying, either with the cloak or in bat form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground). Either of the flying powers is usable for up to 7 minutes at a time, but after a flight of any duration the cloak cannot bestow any flying power for a like period of time.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fly, polymorph;_ Price 26,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Cloak of Charisma:

This lightweight and fashionable cloak has a highly decorative silver trim. When in a character’s possession, it adds a +2, +4, or +6 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _eagle’s splendor;_ Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6); Weight 2 lb.

#### Cloak of Displacement, Minor:

This item appears to be a normal cloak, but when worn by a character its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the _displacement_ spell except that it only grants a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It functions continually.

Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _displacement;_ Price 24,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Cloak of Displacement, Major:

This item appears to be a normal cloak, but on command its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works just like the _displacement_ spell and lasts for a total of 15 rounds per day, which the wearer can divide up as she sees fit.

Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Extend Spell, _displacement;_ Price 50,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Cloak of Elvenkind:

This cloak of neutral gray cloth is indistinguishable from an ordinary cloak of the same color. However, when worn with the hood drawn up around the head, it gives the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks.

Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _invisibility,_ creator must be an elf; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Cloak of Etherealness:

This silvery-gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the _ethereal jaunt_ spell). The effect is dismissible. The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _ethereal jaunt;_ Price 55,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Cloak of the Manta Ray:

This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt water. At that time the _cloak of the manta ray_ adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a manta ray (as the _polymorph_ spell, except that it allows only manta ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability to breathe underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray.

Although the cloak does not enable the wearer to bite opponents as a manta ray does, it does have a tail spine that can be used to strike at opponents behind the wearer, dealing 1d6 points of damage. This attack can be used in addition to any other attack the character has, using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _polymorph_, _water breathing;_ Price 7,200 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Cloak of Resistance:

These garments offer magic protection in the form of a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex, and Will).

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _resistance,_ creator’s caster level must be at least three times the cloak’s bonus; Price 1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5);Weight 1 lb.

#### Crystal Ball:

This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. A character can use the device to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell _scrying_ (Will DC 16 negates).

Certain _crystal balls_ have additional powers that can be used through the _crystal ball_ on the target viewed.

| Crystal Ball Type | Market Price |
| --- | --- |
| _Crystal ball_ | 42,000 gp |
| _Crystal ball_ with _see invisibility_ | 50,000 gp |
| _Crystal ball_ with _detect thoughts (Will DC 13 negates)_ | 51,000 gp |
| _Crystal ball_ with _telepathy_\* | 70,000 gp |
| _Crystal ball_ with _true seeing_ | 80,000 gp |
| \* The viewer is able to send and receive silent mental messages with the person appearing in the crystal ball. Once per day the character may attempt to implant a _suggestion_ (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) as well. |     |

#### Cube of Force:

This device is about 3/4 inch across and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. It enables its possessor to put up a special _wall of force_ 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges, which are renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor’s speed is limited to the maximum value given on the table.

When the _cube of force_ is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal. Spells that affect the integrity of the screenalso drain extra charges. These spells (given in the list below) cannot be cast into or out of the cube:

| Cube Face | Charge Cost per Minute | Maximum Speed | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | 30 ft. | Keeps out gases, wind, etc. |
| 2   | 2   | 20 ft. | Keeps out nonliving matter |
| 3   | 3   | 15 ft. | Keeps out living matter |
| 4   | 4   | 10 ft. | Keeps out magic |
| 5   | 6   | 10 ft. | Keeps out all things |
| 6   | 0   | As normal | Deactivates |

| Attack Form | Extra Charges |
| --- | --- |
| _Horn of blasting_ | 6   |
| _Wall of fire_ | 2   |
| _Passwall_ | 3   |
| _Disintegrate_ | 6   |
| _Phase door_ | 5   |
| _Prismatic spray_ | 7   |

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _wall of force_; Price 62,000 gp.

#### Cube of Frost Resistance:

This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65°F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses into its portable form and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _protection from energy;_ Price 27,000 gp.

#### Cubic Gate:

This item is fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item should choose the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.

If a side of the _cubic gate_ is pressed once, it opens a _gate_ to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the _gate_. It is impossible to open more than one _gate_ at a time.

If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. (The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves).

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _plane shift;_ Price 164,000 gp.

#### Darkskull:

This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an _unhallow_ spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin (except that no additional spell effect is tied or fixed to the _darkskull_).

Moderate evocation \[evil\]; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _unhallow,_ creator must be evil; Price 60,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

#### Decanter of Endless Water:

If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type as well as the volume and velocity.

*   “Stream” pours out 1 gallon per round.
*   “Fountain” produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.
*   “Geyser” produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round.

The geyser effect causes considerable back pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down. The force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage but can only affect one target per round. The command word must be spoken to stop it.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _control water;_ Price 9,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Deck of Illusions:

This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of thirty-four cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a _major image_ of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)

A randomly generated deck is usually complete (11–100 on d%), but may be discovered (01–10) with 1d20 of its cards missing. If cards are missing, reduce the price by a corresponding amount.

Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _major image;_ Price 8,100 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

#### Dimensional Shackles:

These shackles have golden runes traced across their cold iron surface. Any creature bound within them is affected as if a _dimensional anchor_ spell were cast upon her (no save). They fit any Small to Large creature. The DC to break or slip out of the shackles is 30.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _dimensional anchor;_ Price 28,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

#### Drums of Panic:

These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a _fear_ spell (Will DC 16 partial). _Drums of panic_ can be used once per day.

Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fear;_ Price 30,000 gp;Weight 10 lb. for the pair.

#### Dust of Appearance:

This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of _blur_ and _displacement._ (In this, it works just like the _faerie fire_ spell). The dust also reveals figments, _mirror images_, and _projected images_ for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a –30 penalty on its Hide checks. The dust’s effect lasts for 5 minutes.

_Dust of appearance_ is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _glitterdust;_ Price 1,800 gp.

#### Dust of Disappearance:

This dust looks just like _dust of appearance_ and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as _greater invisibility_). Normal vision can’t see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including _see invisibility_ or _invisibility purge_. _Dust of appearance,_ however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by _dust of disappearance._ Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection.

The _greater invisibility_ bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds.The invisible creature doesn’t know when the duration will end.

Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _greater invisibility;_ Price 3,500 gp.

#### Dust of Dryness:

This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.

If the dust is employed against an elemental with the water subtype, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _control water;_ Price 850 gp.

#### Dust of Illusion:

This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and form. Put _dust of illusion_ on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a _disguise self_ glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.

Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _disguise self;_ Price 1,200 gp.

#### Dust of Tracelessness:

This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.

A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _pass without trace;_ Price 250 gp.

#### Efficient Quiver:

This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about twenty arrows. It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to sixty objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to eighteen objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as six objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can produce any item she wishes, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The _efficientquiver_ weighs the same no matter what’s placed inside it.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _secret chest;_ Price 1,800 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Efreeti Bottle:

This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three _wishes_. In either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti’s death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day’s effect.

Strong conjuration; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, _summon monster VII;_ Price 145,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Elemental Gem:

This gem contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific Elemental Plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).

When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a _summon nature’s ally_ spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.

The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons. _Air elemental gems_ are transparent, _earth elemental gems_ are light brown, _fire elemental gems_ are reddish orange, and _water elemental gems_ are blue-green.

Moderate conjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _summon nature’s ally V;_ Price 2,250 gp.

#### Elixir of Fire Breath:

This strange elixir bestows upon the drinker the ability to spit gouts of flame. He can breathe fire up to three times, each time dealing 4d6 points of fire damage to a single target up to 25 feet away. The victim can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half damage. Unused blasts dissipate 1 hour after the liquid is consumed.

Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _scorching ray_; Price 1,100 gp.

#### Elixir of Hiding:

A character drinking this liquid gains an intuitive ability to hide (+10 competence bonus on Hide checks for 1 hour).

Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _invisibility;_ Price 250 gp.

#### Elixir of Love:

This sweet-tasting liquid causes the character drinking it to become _charmed_ with the first creature she sees after consuming the draft (as _charm person_—the drinker must be a humanoid of Medium or smaller size, Will DC 14 negates). The _charm_ effects wear off in 1d3 hours.

Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, _charm person;_ Price 150 gp.

#### Elixir of Sneaking:

This draught of liquid grants the drinker the ability to walk softly and dampens sound around her slightly, granting a +10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 hour.

Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _silence;_ Price 250 gp.

#### Elixir of Swimming:

This elixir bestows swimming ability. An almost imperceptible magic sheath surrounds the drinker, allowing him to glide through the water easily (+10 competence bonus on Swim checks for 1 hour).

Faint illusion; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have 5 ranks in the Swim skill; Price 250 gp.

#### Elixir of Truth:

This elixir forces the individual drinking it to say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes (Will DC 13 negates).

She is compelled to answer any questions put to her in that time, but with each question she is free to make a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn’t break free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn’t have to answer that particular question. No more than one question can be asked each round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment.

Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _zone of truth;_ Price 500 gp.

#### Elixir of Vision:

Drinking this elixir grants the imbiber the ability to notice acute details with great accuracy (+10 competence bonus on Search checks for 1 hour).

Faint divination; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, _true seeing;_ Price 250 gp.

#### Eversmoking Bottle:

This metal urn is identical in appearance to an _efreeti bottle,_ except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the _eversmoking bottle_ is stoppered.

The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _pyrotechnics;_ Price 5,400 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Eyes of Charming:

These two crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes. The wearer is able to use _charm person_ (one target per round) merely by meeting a target’s gaze. Those failing a DC 16 Will save are _charmed_ as per the spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10.

Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Heighten Spell, _charm person;_ Price 56,000 gp for a pair.

#### Eyes of Doom:

These crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes, enabling him to cast _doom_ upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the _doom_ spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10. However, if the wearer has both lenses, he gains the additional power of a continual _deathwatch_ effect and can use _fear_ (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week.

Moderate necromancy; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _doom, deathwatch, fear;_ Price 25,000 gp.

#### Eyes of the Eagle:

These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. These lenses grant a +5 competence bonus on Spot checks. Wearing only one of the pair causes a character to become dizzy and, in effect, stunned for 1 round. Thereafter, the wearer can use the single lens without being stunned so long as she covers her other eye. Of course, she can remove the single lens and see normally at any time, or wear both lenses to end or avoid the dizziness.

Faint divination; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _clairaudience/clairvoyance;_ Price 2,500 gp.

#### Eyes of Petrification:

These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. They allow her to use a petrification gaze attack (Fortitude DC 19 negates) for 10 rounds per day. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _flesh to stone;_ Price 98,000 gp.

#### Figurine of Wondrous Power:

Each of the several kinds of _figurines of wondrous power_ appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.

If a _figurine of wondrous power_ is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.

_Bronze Griffon:_ When animated, a _bronze griffon_ acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the _bronze griffon_ once again becomes a tiny statuette.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects;_ Price 10,000 gp.

_Ebony Fly:_ When animated, an _ebony fly_ is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a hippogriff but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the _ebony fly_ again becomes a tiny statuette.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects;_ Price 10,000 gp.

_Golden Lions:_ These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for one full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects;_ Price 16,500 gp.

_Ivory Goats:_ These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:

*   _The Goat of Traveling:_ This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used.
*   _The Goat of Travail:_ This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.
*   _The Goat of Terror:_ When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, with the statistics of a light warhorse. However, its rider can employ the goat’s horns as weapons (one horn as a _+3 heavy lance,_ the other as a _+5 longsword_). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the _goat of terror_ radiates _fear_ as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per use.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects;_ Price 21,000 gp.

_Marble Elephant:_ This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a _marble elephant_ grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine’s owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects;_ Price 17,000 gp.

_Obsidian Steed:_ This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: _overland flight, plane shift,_ and _ethereal jaunt._ The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an _obsidian steed_ becomes ethereal or _plane shifts,_ its rider and his gear follow suit.

Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.

Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects, etherealness, fly, plane shift;_ Price 28,500 gp.

_Onyx Dog:_ When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. (It has the scent ability and adds +4 to its Spot and Search checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can _see invisibility._ An _onyx dog_ can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects;_ Price 15,500 gp.

_Serpentine Owl:_ This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. (Remember the limitations of its Intelligence.)

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects;_ Price 9,100 gp.

_Silver Raven:_ This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an _animal messenger_ spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.

Faint enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animal messenger, animate objects;_ Price 3,800 gp.

#### Feather Token:

Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once.

_Anchor:_ A token useful to moor a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to one day.

_Bird:_ A token that can be used to deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated target as would a carrier pigeon. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.

_Fan:_ A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.

_Swan Boat:_ A token that forms a swanlike boat capable of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear or thirty-two Medium characters or any equivalent combination. The boat lasts for one day.

_Tree:_ A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.

_Whip:_ A token that forms into a huge leather whip and wields itself against any opponent desired just like a dancing weapon. The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of damage, has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a free grapple attack (with a +15 attack bonus) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour.

Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, _major creation;_ Price 50 gp (_anchor_), 300 gp (_bird_), 200 gp (_fan_), 450 gp (_swan boat_), 400 gp (_tree_), 500 gp (_whip_).

#### Gauntlets of Ogre Power:

These gauntlets are made of tough leather with iron studs running across the back of the hands and fingers. They grant the wearer great strength, adding a +2 enhancement bonus to his Strength score. Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _bull’s strength;_ Price 4,000 gp;Weight 4 lb.

#### Gauntlet of Rust:

This single metal gauntlet looks rusted and pitted but is actually quite powerful. Once per day, it can affect an object as with the _rusting grasp_ spell. It also completely protects the wearer and her gear from rust (magical or otherwise), including the attack of a rust monster.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _rusting grasp;_ Price 11,500 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Gem of Brightness:

This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.

*   One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges.
*   Another command word causes the _gem of brightness_ to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.
*   The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.

A newly created _gem of brightness_ has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical.

Faint evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _daylight;_ Price 13,000 gp.

#### Gem of Seeing:

This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a _gem of seeing_ enables the user to see as though she were affected by the _true seeing_ spell. A _gem of seeing_ can be used for as much as 30 minutes a day, divided up into periods of minutes or rounds as the user sees fit.

Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _true seeing;_ Price 75,000 gp.

#### Gloves of Arrow Snaring:

Once snugly worn, these gloves seem to meld with the hands, becoming almost invisible. Twice per day, the wearer can act as if he had the Snatch Arrows feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for it. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective. At least one hand must be free to take advantage of the magic.

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _shield;_ Price 4,000 gp.

#### Gloves of Dexterity:

These thin leather gloves are very flexible and allow for delicate manipulation. They add to the wearer’s Dexterity score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _cat’s grace;_ Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).

#### Glove of Storing:

This device is a simple leather glove. On command, one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand. While stored, the item has negligible weight. With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove can only store one item at a time. Storing or retrieving the item is a free action. The item is held in stasis and shrunk down so small within the palm of the glove that it cannot be seen. Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue to expire. If an effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears instantly.

Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _shrink item;_ Price 10,000 gp (one glove).

#### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing:

These apparently normal lightweight gloves grant a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks and Climb checks. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _bull’s strength, cat’s grace;_ Price 6,250 gp.

#### Goggles of Minute Seeing:

The lenses of this item are made of special crystal. When placed over the eyes of the wearer, the lenses enable her to see much better than normal at distances of 1 foot or less, granting her a +5 competence bonus on Search checks to find secret doors, traps, and similar concealed objects. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Faint divination; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _true seeing;_ Price 1,250 gp.

#### Goggles of Night:

The lenses of this item are made of dark crystal. Even though the lenses are opaque, when placed over the eyes of the wearer they enable him to see normally and also grant him 60-foot darkvision. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _darkvision;_ Price 12,000 gp.

#### Golem Manual:

A _golem manual_ contains information, incantations and magical power that help a character to craft a golem. The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem’s body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem, effectively grants the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the construction of the golem, and grants the character an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem. Any golem built using a _golem manual_ does not cost the creator any XP, since the requisite XP are “contained” in the book and “expended” by the book during the creation process.

The spells included in a _golem manual_ require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem’s body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book’s ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.

_Clay Golem Manual:_ The book contains _animate objects, bless, commune, prayer_, and _resurrection_. The reader may treat her caster level as two levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a clay golem. The book supplies 1,540 XP for the creation of a clay golem.

Moderate conjuration, divination, enchantment, and transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 11th, _animate objects, commune, prayer, resurrection_; Price 12,000 gp; Cost 2,150 gp + 1,712 XP; Weight 5 lb.

_Flesh Golem Manual:_ The book contains _animate dead, bull’s strength, geas/quest,_ and _limited wish_. The reader may treat her caster level as one level higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a flesh golem. The book supplies 780 XP for the creation of a flesh golem.

Moderate enchantment, necromancy \[evil\], and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 8th, _animate dead, bull’s strength, geas/quest, limited wish_; Price 8,000 gp; Cost 2,050 gp + 944 XP; Weight 5 lb.

_Iron Golem Manual:_ The book contains _cloudkill, geas/quest, limited wish_, and _polymorph any object_. The reader may treat her caster level as four levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a iron golem. The book supplies 5,600 XP for the creation of a iron golem.

Strong conjuration, enchantment and transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 16th, _cloudkill, geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object_; Price 35,000 gp; Cost 3,500 gp + 5,880 XP; Weight 5 lb.

_Stone Golem Manual:_ The book contains _geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object_, and _slow_. The reader may treat her caster level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone golem. The book supplies 3,400 XP for the creation of a stone golem.

Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 14th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 14th, _antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning_; Price 22,000 gp; Cost 2,500 gp + 3,600 XP; Weight 5 lb.

_Stone Golem Manual, Greater:_ The book contains _geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object_, and _slow_. The reader may treat her caster level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone golem. The book supplies 7,640 XP for the creation of a greater stone golem.

Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 16th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 16th, _antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning_; Price 44,000 gp; Cost 2,900 gp + 7,872 XP; Weight 5 lb.

#### Hand of Glory:

This mummified human hand hangs by a leather cord around a character’s neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use _daylight_ and _see invisibility_ each once per day.

Faint varied; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate dead_, _daylight, detect invisibility;_ Price 8,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Hand of the Mage:

This mummified elf hand hangs by a golden chain around a character’s neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). It allows the wearer to utilize the spell _mage hand_ at will.

Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, _mage hand;_ Price 900 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Handy Haversack:

A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a _bag of holding_ and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.

While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power in addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _secret chest;_ Price 2,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

#### Harp of Charming:

This instrument is a golden, intricately carved harp. When played, it enables the performer to work one _suggestion_ (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) into the music for each 10 minutes of playing if he can succeed on a DC 14 Perform (string instruments) check. If the check fails, the audience cannot be affected by any further performances from the harpist for 24 hours.

Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _suggestion;_ Price 7,500 gp;Weight 5 lb.

#### Hat of Disguise:

This apparently normal hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance as with a _disguise self_ spell. As part of the disguise, the hat can be changed to appear as a comb, ribbon, headband, cap, coif, hood, helmet, and so on.

Faint illusion; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, _disguise self;_ Price 1,800 gp.

#### Headband of Intellect:

This device is a light cord with a small gem set so that it rests upon the forehead of the wearer. The headband adds to the wearer’s Intelligence score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6. This enhancement bonus does not earn the wearer extra skill points when a new level is attained; use the unenhanced Intelligence bonus to determine skill points.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fox’s cunning;_ Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).

#### Helm of Brilliance:

This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels’ functions are as follows:

*   Diamond: _Prismatic spray_ (save DC 20)
*   Ruby: _Wall of fire_
*   Fire opal: _Fireball_ (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )
*   Opal: _Daylight_

The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a _helm of brilliance_ also has the following magical properties when activated.

*   It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.
*   The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect.
*   The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.

Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.

If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become _prismatic sprays_ that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line _walls of fire_ extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become _fireballs_ centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.

Strong varied; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _detect undead, fireball, flame blade, light, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of fire;_ Price 125,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Helm of Comprehend Languages and Read Magic:

Appearing as a normal helmet, a _helm of comprehend languages and read magic_ grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any language and any magical writing. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Decipher Script checks to understand messages written in incomplete, archaic, or exotic forms. Note that understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply spell use.

Faint divination; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, _comprehend languages, read magic;_ Price 5,200 gp; Weight 3 lb.

#### Helm of Telepathy:

The wearer can use _detect thoughts_ at will. Furthermore, he can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface thoughts he is reading (allowing two-way communication). Once per day, the wearer of the helm can implant a _suggestion_ (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) along with his telepathic message.

Faint divination and enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _detect thoughts, suggestion;_ Price 27,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Helm of Teleportation:

A character wearing this device may _teleport_ three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _teleport;_ Price 73,500 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Helm of Underwater Action:

The wearer of this helmet can see underwater. Drawing the small lenses in compartments on either side into position before the wearer’s eyes activates the visual properties of the helm, allowing her to see five times farther than water and light conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the _helm of underwater action_ creates a globe of air around the wearer’s head and maintains it until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _water breathing;_ Price 57,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Horn of Blasting:

This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take 7d6 points of sonic damage, with no save unless they’re held, worn, or carried by creatures (Will DC 16 negates).

If a _horn of blasting_ is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of damage to the person sounding it.

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _shout;_ Price 20,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Horn of Blasting, Greater:

This horn functions as a _horn of blasting,_ except that it deals 10d6 points of sonic damage, stuns creatures for 1 round, and deafens them for 4d6 rounds (a DC 19 Fortitude reduces the damage by half and negates the stunning and deafening). Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described for the _horn of blasting._ A _greater horn of blasting_ also has a 20% cumulative chance of exploding.

Strong evocation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, _greater shout;_ Price 70,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Horn of Fog:

This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an _obscuring mist_ spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; fog clouds travel 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

Faint conjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _obscuring mist;_ Price 2,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Horn of Goodness/Evil:

This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner’s alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If he is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a _magic circle against evil_. If he is evil, then blowing the horn has the effect of a _magic circle against good_. In either case, this ward lasts for 1 hour. The horn can be blown once per day.

Faint abjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _magic circle against good, magic circle against evil;_ Price 6,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Horn of the Tritons:

This device is a conch shell that can be blown once per day except by a triton which can sound it three times per day. A _horn of the tritons_ can perform any one of the following functions when blown.

*   Calm rough waters in a 1-mile radius. This effect dispels a summoned water elemental if it fails a DC 16 Will save.
*   Attract 5d4 Large sharks (01–30 on d%), 5d6 Medium sharks (31–80), or 1d10 sea lions (81–100) if the character is in a body of water in which such creatures dwell. The creatures are friendly and obey, to the best of their ability, the one who sounded the horn.
*   Causes aquatic creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 within 500 feet to become panicked as if they had been targeted by a _fear_ spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who successfully save are shaken for 3d6 rounds.

Any sounding of a _horn of the tritons_ can be heard by all tritons within a 3-mile radius.

Moderate conjuration and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fear, summon monster V, control water,_ creator must be a triton or get construction aid from a triton; Price 15,100 gp; Weight 2 lb.

#### Horn of Valhalla:

This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be normal until someone speaks its command word and blows the horn. Then the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every seven days. Roll d% and refer to the table below to see what type of horn is found. The horn’s type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a _horn of Valhalla_ but doesn’t have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.

| d%  | Type of Horn | Barbarians Summoned | Prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01–40 | Silver | 2d4+2, 2nd level | None |
| 41–75 | Brass | 2d4+1, 3rd level | Spellcaster level 1st |
| 76–90 | Bronze | 2d4, 4th level | Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic music ability |
| 91–100 | Iron | 1d4+1, 5th level | Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic music ability |

Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _summon monster VI;_ Price 50,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Horseshoes of Speed:

These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes. When affixed to an animal’s hooves, they increase the animal’s base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances increase proportionally. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _haste;_ Price 3,000 gp;Weight 12 lb. (for four).

#### Horseshoes of a Zephyr:

These four iron shoes are affixed like normal horseshoes. They allow a horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that nonsolid or unstable surfaces can be crossed, and that movement is possible without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base land speed. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _levitate;_ Price 6,000 gp;Weight 4 lb. (for four).

#### Incense of Meditation:

This small rectangular block of sweet smelling incense is visually indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burning, the special fragrance and pearly-hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check.

When a divine spellcaster lights a block of _incense of meditation_ and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).

Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours.

Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell, _bless;_ Price 4,900 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Instant Fortress:

This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even _knock_ spells can’t open the door.

The adamantine walls of _instant fortress_ have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a _wish_ or a _miracle_, which restores 50 points of damage taken.

The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device’s owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress’s sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).

The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _mage’s magnificent mansion;_ Price 55,000 gp.

#### Ioun Stone:

These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. _Ioun stones_ have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

| Color | Shape | Effect | Market Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clear | Spindle | Sustains creature without food or water | 4,000 gp |
| Dusty rose | Prism | +1 insight bonus to AC | 5,000 gp |
| Deep red | Sphere | +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity | 8,000 gp |
| Incandescent blue | Sphere | +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom | 8,000 gp |
| Pale blue | Rhomboid | +2 enhancement bonus to Strength | 8,000 gp |
| Pink | Rhomboid | +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution | 8,000 gp |
| Pink and green | Sphere | +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma | 8,000 gp |
| Scarlet and blue | Sphere | +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence | 8,000 gp |
| Dark blue | Rhomboid | Alertness (as the feat) | 10,000 gp |
| Vibrant purple | Prism | Stores three levels of spells, as a _ring of spell storing_ | 36,000 gp |
| Iridescent | Spindle | Sustains creature without air | 18,000 gp |
| Pale lavender | Ellipsoid | Absorbs spells of 4th level or lower ___1___ | 20,000 gp |
| Pearly white | Spindle | Regenerate 1 point of damage per hour | 20,000 gp |
| Pale green | Prism | +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks | 30,000 gp |
| Orange | Prism | +1 caster level | 30,000 gp |
| Lavender and green | Ellipsoid | Absorbs spells of 8th level or lower ___2___ | 40,000 gp |
___1___ After absorbing twenty spell levels, the stone burns out and turns to dull gray, forever useless.
___2___ After absorbing fifty spell levels, the stone burns out and turns dull gray, forever useless. 

Regeneration from the pearly white _ioun stone_ works like a _ring of regeneration._ (It only cures damage taken while the character is using the stone.) The pale lavender and lavender and green stones work like a _rod of absorption,_ but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to empower spells. Stored spells in the vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by anyone (see _ring of minor spell storing_).

Moderate varied; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level.

#### Iron Bands of Binding:

When initially discovered, this very potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.

When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and ruin) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 Escape Artist check. _Iron bands of binding_ are usable once per day.

Strong evocation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _grasping hand;_ Price 26,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Iron Flask:

These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.

The command word can be given only once per day.

If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following:

| d%  | Contents | d%  | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01–50 | Empty | 89  | Demon (glabrezu) |
| 51–54 | Large air elemental | 90  | Demon (succubus) |
| 55–58 | Arrowhawk | 91  | Devil (osyluth) |
| 59–62 | Large earth elemental | 92  | Devil (barbazu) |
| 63–66 | Xorn | 93  | Devil (erinyes) |
| 67–70 | Large fire elemental | 94  | Devil (cornugon) |
| 71–74 | Salamander | 95  | Celestial (avoral) |
| 75–78 | Large water elemental | 96  | Celestial (ghaele) |
| 79–82 | Adult tojanida | 97  | Formian myrmarch |
| 83–84 | Chaos Beast | 98  | Arrowhawk, elder |
| 85–86 | Formian taskmaster | 99  | Rakshasa |
| 87  | Demon (vrock) | 100 | Demon (balor) or devil (pit fiend)—equal chance for either |
| 88  | Demon (hezrou) |

Strong conjuration; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, _trap the soul_; Price 170,000 gp (empty);Weight 1 lb.

#### Lantern of Revealing:

This lantern operates as a normal hooded lantern. While it is lit, it also reveals all invisible creatures and objects within 25 feet of it, just like the spell _invisibility purge._

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _invisibility purge;_ Price 30,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Lens of Detection:

This circular prism enables its user to detect minute details, granting a +5 bonus on Search checks.

It also aids in following tracks, adding a +5 bonus on Survival checks when tracking. The lens is about 6 inches in diameter and set in a frame with a handle.

Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _true seeing;_ Price 3,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Lyre of Building:

If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against all inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a _horn of blasting,_ a _disintegrate_ spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.

The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, or whatever. The effect produced in but 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for three days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.

#### Manual of Bodily Health:

This thick tome contains tips on health and fitness, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, he gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of manual) to his Constitution score.

#### Marvelous Pigments:

These magic emulsions enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the desired image. One pot of _marvelous pigments_ is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.

Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can’t be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. _Marvelous pigments_ cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments —precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on— appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, paste, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp.

Items created are not magical; the effect is instantaneous.

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _major creation;_ Price 4,000 gp.

#### Mask of the Skull:

This ivory mask has been fashioned into the likeness of a human skull. Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer’s face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer’s base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be struck dead, as if affected by a _finger of death_ spell. If the target succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.

Strong necromancy and transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects, finger of death, fly;_ Price 22,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.

#### Mattock of the Titans:

This digging tool is 10 feet long. Any creature of at least Huge size can use it to loosen or tumble earth or earthen ramparts (a 10-foot cube every 10 minutes). It also smashes rock (a 10-foot cube per hour). If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a Gargantuan _+3 adamantine warhammer,_ dealing 4d6 points of base damage.

Strong transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _move earth;_ Price 23,348 gp; Cost 13,348 gp + 800 XP; Weight 120 lb.

#### Maul of the Titans:

This mallet is 8 feet long. If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a _+3 greatclub_ and deals triple damage against inanimate objects. However, the wielder must have a Strength of at least 18 to wield it properly. Otherwise, she takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _clenched fist;_ Price 25,305 gp; Cost 12,305 gp + 480 XP; Weight 160 lb.

#### Medallion of Thoughts:

This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung from a neck chain. Usually fashioned from bronze, copper, or nickel-silver, the medallion allows the wearer to read the thoughts of others, as with the spell _detect thoughts._

Faint divination; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _detect thoughts;_ Price 12,000 gp.

#### Mirror of Life Trapping:

This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A _mirror of life trapping_ has fifteen nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).

When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim’s equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror’s owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.

If the mirror’s capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.

Strong abjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, _imprisonment;_ Price 200,000 gp;Weight 50 lb.

#### Mirror of Mental Prowess:

This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. The possessor who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows.

*   Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the owner is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.
*   View other places as if with _clairvoyance,_ but vision extends even onto other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.
*   Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the _clairvoyance_ function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she’s still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a _scrying_ spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.
*   Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the _legend lore_ spell).

Strong conjuration and divination; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, _detect thoughts_, _clairaudience/clairvoyance, gate, legend lore_; Price 175,000 gp; Weight 40 lb.

#### Mirror of Opposition:

This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror’s surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and her items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day.

Strong necromancy; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _clone;_ Price 92,000 gp;Weight 45 lb.

#### Necklace of Adaptation:

This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases (such as _cloudkill_ and _stinking cloud_ effects, as well as inhaled poisons) and allowing him to breathe, even underwater or in a vacuum.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, _alter self;_ Price 9,000 gp.

#### Necklace of Fireballs:

This device appears to be nothing but beads on a string, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character’s worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a _fireball_ spell (Reflex DC 14 half ).

Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.

Each _necklace of fireballs_ contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed below.

| Necklace | 10d6 | 9d6 | 8d6 | 7d6 | 6d6 | 5d6 | 4d6 | 3d6 | 2d6 | Market Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type I | —   | —   | —   | —   | —   | 1   | —   | 2   | —   | 1,650 gp |
| Type II | —   | —   | —   | —   | 1   | —   | 2   | —   | 2   | 2,700 gp |
| Type III | —   | —   | —   | 1   | —   | 2   | —   | 4   | —   | 4,350 gp |
| Type IV | —   | —   | 1   | —   | 2   | —   | 2   | —   | 4   | 5,400 gp |
| Type V | —   | 1   | —   | 2   | —   | 2   | —   | 2   | —   | 5,850 gp |
| Type VI | 1   | —   | 2   | —   | 2   | —   | 4   | —   | —   | 8,100 gp |
| Type VII | 1   | 2   | —   | 2   | —   | 2   | —   | 2   | —   | 8,700 gp |

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fireball._

#### Orb of Storms:

This glass sphere is 8 inches in diameter. The possessor can call forth all manner of weather, even supernaturally destructive storms. Once per day she can call upon the orb to use a _control weather_ spell, Once per month, she can conjure a _storm of vengeance_. The possessor of the orb is continually protected by an _endure elements_ effect.

Strong varied; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, _control weather, endure elements, storm of vengeance;_ Price 48,000 gp;Weight 6 lb.

#### Pearl of Power:

This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a _pearl of power_ enables the possessor to recall any one spell that she had prepared and then cast. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the pearl. Different pearls exist for recalling one spell per day of each level from 1st through 9th and for the recall of two spells per day (each of a different level, 6th or lower).

Strong transmutation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be able to cast spells of the spell level to be recalled; Price 1,000 gp (1st), 4,000 gp (2nd), 9,000 gp (3rd), 16,000 gp (4th), 25,000 gp (5th), 36,000 gp (6th), 49,000 gp (7th), 64,000 gp (8th), 81,000 gp (9th), or 70,000 gp (two spells).

#### Pearl of the Sirines:

This normal-seeming pearl is beautiful and worth at least 1,000 gp on that basis alone. If it is clasped firmly in hand or held to the breast while the possessor attempts actions related to the pearl’s powers, she understands and is able to employ the item.

The pearl enables its possessor to breathe in water as if she were in clean, fresh air. Her swim speed is 60 feet, and she can cast spells and act underwater without hindrance.

Moderate abjuration and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _freedom of movement, water breathing;_ Price 15,300 gp.

#### Periapt of Health:

The wearer of this blue gem on a silver chain is immune to disease, including supernatural diseases.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _remove disease;_ Price 7,500 gp.

#### Periapt of Proof against Poison:

This item is a brilliant-cut black gem on a delicate silver chain. The wearer is immune to poison, although poisons still active when the periapt is first donned still run their course.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _neutralize poison;_ Price 27,000 gp.

#### Periapt of Wisdom:

Although it appears to be a normal pearl on a light chain, a _periapt of wisdom_ actually increases the possessor’s Wisdom score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6 (depending on the individual item).

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _owl’s wisdom;_ Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).

#### Periapt of Wound Closure:

This stone is bright red and dangles on a gold chain. The wearer of this periapt automatically becomes stable if his hit points drop to between –1 and –9 inclusive. The periapt doubles the wearer’s normal rate of healing or allows normal healing of wounds that would not do so normally. Hit point damage that involves bleeding is negated for the wearer of the periapt, but he is still susceptible to damage from bleeding that causes Constitution loss, such as that dealt by a wounding weapon.

Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _heal;_ Price 15,000 gp.

#### Phylactery of Faithfulness:

This item is a small box containing religious scripture affixed to a leather cord and tied around the forehead. There is no mundane way to determine what function this religious item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a _phylactery of faithfulness_ is aware of any action or item that could adversely affect his alignment and his standing with his deity, including magical effects. He acquires this information prior to performing such an action or becoming associated with such an item if he takes a moment to contemplate the act.

Faint divination; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, _detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law;_ Price 1,000 gp.

#### Phylactery of Undead Turning:

This item is a boon to any character able to turn undead, allowing him to do so as if his class level were four levels higher than it actually is.

Moderate necromancy \[good\]; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, 10th-level cleric; Price 11,000 gp.

#### Pipes of Haunting:

This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. _Pipes of haunting_ can be sounded twice a day.

Faint necromancy; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, _scare;_ Price 6,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Pipes of Pain:

These appear to be like any other standard set of pipes with nothing to reveal their true nature. When played by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create a wondrous melody. All within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Will save or be fascinated by the sound. (This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion.)

As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally silent area, she takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 2d4 rounds. During this time, damage from sonic attacks is doubled. Thereafter, the least noise causes an affected character to become shaken (except when she is in a totally silent area). This hypersensitivity is a curse and therefore hard to remove (see the _bestow curse_ spell).

Faint enchantment and evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have the bardic music class feature, _sound burst;_ Price 12,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Pipes of the Sewers:

These wooden pipes appear ordinary, but if the possessor learns the proper tune, he can attract 1d3 rat swarms if rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper’s telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. If they are called again within a day, the Perform check DC is 15.

If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control.

Faint conjuration; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, _charm animal, summon nature’s ally I,_ wild empathy ability; Price 1,150 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Pipes of Sounding:

When played by a character who has the Perform (wind instruments) skill, these pipes create a variety of sounds. The figment sounds are the equivalent of _ghost sound_ (caster level 2nd).

Faint illusion; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, _ghost sound;_ Price 1,800 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Portable Hole:

A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains.

The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each _portable hole_ opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a _bag of holding_ is placed within a _portable hole_, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a _portable hole_ is placed within a _bag of holding,_ it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the _portable hole_ and _bag of holding_ being destroyed in the process.

Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, _plane shift;_ Price 20,000 gp.

#### Restorative Ointment:

A jar of this unguent is 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep and contains five applications. Placed upon a poisoned wound or swallowed, the ointment detoxifies any poison (as _neutralize poison_). Applied to a diseased area, it removes disease (as _remove disease_). Rubbed on a wound, the ointment cures 1d8+5 points of damage (as _cure light wounds_).

Faint conjuration; CL 5th;Craft Wondrous Item, _cure light wounds, neutralize poison, remove disease;_ Price 4,000 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

#### Ring Gates:

These always come in pairs—two iron rings, each about 18 inches in diameter. The rings must be on the same plane of existence and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever is put through one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of material can be transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a _ring gate._ A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily. Each ring has a “entry side” and an “exit side,” both marked with appropriate symbols.

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, _gate;_ Price 40,000 gp;Weight 1 lb. each.

#### Robe of the Archmagi:

This normal-appearing garment can be white (01–45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46–75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76–100, evil alignment). Its wearer, if an arcane spellcaster, gains the following powers.

*   +5 armor bonus to AC.
*   Spell resistance 18.
*   +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
*   +2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance.

If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains three negative levels. The reverse is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two negative levels. While these negative levels never result in lost levels, they remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells).

Strong varied; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, _antimagic field, mage armor_ or _shield of faith,_ creator must be of same alignment as robe; Price 75,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Robe of Blending:

When this robe is put on, the wearer intuitively knows that the garment has very special properties. A _robe of blending_ enables its wearer to appear to be part of his surroundings. This allows him a +10 competence bonus on Hide checks. The wearer can adopt the appearance of another creature, as with the _disguise self_ spell, at will. All creatures acquainted with and friendly to the wearer see him normally.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _disguise self;_ Price 30,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Robe of Bones:

This handy item functions much like a _robe of useful items_ for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery and recognize them for the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created _robe of bones_ always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:

*   Small goblin skeleton
*   Medium human commoner skeleton
*   Medium wolf skeleton
*   Small goblin zombie
*   Medium human commoner zombie
*   Medium wolf zombie

Moderate necromancy \[evil\]; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate dead_; Price 2,400 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Robe of Eyes:

This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe until it is put on. Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the same moment due to scores of visible, magical eyelike patterns that adorn the robe. She also gains 120-foot darkvision.

The _robe of eyes_ sees all forms of invisible or ethereal things within 120 feet.

The wearer of a _robe of eyes_ gains a +10 competence bonus on Search checks and Spot checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and she can’t be flanked. However, she is not able to avert her eyes or close her eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.

A _light_ or _continual flame_ spell cast directly on a _robe of eyes_ causes it to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A _daylight_ spell blinds it for 2d4 minutes.

Moderate divination; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _true seeing;_ Price 120,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Robe of Scintillating Colors:

The wearer of this robe can cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.

Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total concealment).

The robe illuminates a 30-foot radius continuously.

The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.

Moderate illusion; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, _blur, rainbow pattern;_ Price 27,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Robe of Stars:

This garment is typically black or dark blue and embroidered with small white or silver stars. The robe has three magical powers.

*   It enables its wearer to travel physically to the Astral Plane, along with all that she is wearing or carrying.
*   It gives its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws.
*   Its wearer can use up to six of the embroidered stars on the chest portion of the robe as _+5 shuriken._ The robe grants its wearer proficiency with such weapons. Each shuriken disappears after it is used.

Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _magic missile, astral projection_ or _plane shift;_ Price 58,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

#### Robe of Useful Items:

This appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small cloth patches of various shapes. Only the wearer of the robe can see these patches, recognize them for what items they become, and detach them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A newly created _robe of useful items_ always has two each of the following patches:

*   Dagger
*   Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
*   Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror)
*   Pole (10-foot length)
*   Hempen rope (50-foot coil)
*   Sack

In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below to determine its nature.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fabricate;_ Price 7,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Rope of Climbing:

A 60-foot-long _rope of climbing_ is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.

A _rope of climbing_ can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied but lowers the DC of Climb checks while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate rope;_ Price 3,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

#### Rope of Entanglement:

A _rope of entanglement_ looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check.

The rope has AC 22, 12 hit points, and hardness 10, and it has damage reduction 5/slashing as well. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a _rope of entanglement_ is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.

Moderate transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, _animate objects, animate rope, entangle;_ Price 21,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.

#### Salve of Slipperiness:

This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all Escape Artist checks, meaning that it is almost impossible to grapple such a character or to tie or chain him up. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting _grease_ spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).

_Salve of slipperiness_ is needed to coat the inside of a container that is meant to hold _sovereign glue_ (see below).

Faint conjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, _grease;_ Price 1,000 gp.

#### Scabbard of Keen Edges:

This scabbard is fashioned from cured leather and fine silver. It can shrink or enlarge to accommodate any knife, dagger, sword, or similar weapon up to and including a greatsword. Up to three times per day on command, the scabbard casts _keen edge_ on any blade placed within it.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _keen edge;_ Price 16,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

#### Scarab of Protection:

This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a beetle. If it is held for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective device.

The scarab’s possessor gains spell resistance 20. The scarab can also absorb energy-draining attacks, death effects, and negative energy effects. Upon absorbing twelve such attacks, the scarab turns to powder and is destroyed.

Strong abjuration and necromancy; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, _death ward, spell resistance;_ Price 38,000 gp.

#### Scarab, Golembane:

This beetle-shaped pin enables its wearer to detect any golem within 60 feet, although he must concentrate (a standard action) in order for the detection to take place. A scarab enables its possessor to combat golems with weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons as if those golems had no damage reduction.

Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, _detect magic,_ creator must be at least 10th level; Price 2,500 gp.

#### Shrouds of Disintegration:

These burial wrappings look to be made of fine, embroidered materials. When a body is placed inside, a command word will turn it to dust. The magic of the shrouds is usable only once, after which the wrappings become ordinary, fine cloth.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, _disintegrate_; Price 6,600 gp; Weight 10 lb.

#### Silversheen:

This substance can be applied to a weapon as a standard action. It will give the weapon the properties of alchemical silver for 1 hour, replacing the properties of any other special material it might have. One vial will coat a single melee weapon or 20 units of ammunition.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item; Price 250 gp.

#### Slippers of Spider Climbing:

When worn, a pair of these slippers enable movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer’s hands free. Her speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces—icy, oiled, or greased surfaces— make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses.

Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, _spider climb;_ Price 4,800 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

#### Sovereign Glue:

This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of _salve of slipperiness_, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the _salve of slipperiness_ must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of _sovereign glue,_ when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8–1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask’s capacity taken up by the _salve of slipperiness._ One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when _universal solvent_ is applied to the bond. (_Sovereign glue_ is dissolved by _universal solvent._)

Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, _make whole;_ Price 2,400 gp (per ounce).

#### Stone of Alarm:

This stone cube, when given the command word, affixes itself to any object. If that object is touched thereafter by anyone who does not first speak that same command word, the stone emits a piercing screech for 1 hour that can be heard up to a quarter-mile away (assuming no intervening barriers).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, _alarm;_ Price 2,700 gp;Weight 2 lb.

#### Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals:

A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock.

The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summoner. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak, and in all ways the stone functions as the _summon monster VII_ spell. (If sand or rough, unhewn stone is the summoning medium, the elemental that comes is Large instead, and the stone functions as the _summon monster VI_ spell.) The elemental appears in 1d4 rounds. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new patch of earth or stone, which cannot be accessed until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _summon monster VI, summon monster VII;_ Price 100,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

#### Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone):

This stone is typically a bit of rough polished agate or some similar mineral. Its possessor gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _divine favor;_ Price 20,000 gp.

#### Stone Horse:

Each item of this nature appears to be a fullsized, roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind.

A _stone horse_ can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first using a _stone to flesh_ spell, thus causing the _stone horse_ to become a normal horse that can be healed normally. When fully healed, it automatically reverts to its stone form. While in its stone form, it can be fed gems, healing 1 point of damage for each 50 gp worth of mineral it is given.

There are two sorts of _stone horses._

_Courser:_ This item has the statistics of a heavy horse as well as having hardness 10.

_Destrier:_ This item has the statistics of a heavy warhorse as well as having hardness 10.

Strong transmutation; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, _flesh to stone, animate objects;_ Price 10,000 gp (_courser_) or 14,800 gp (_destrier_);Weight 6,000 lb.

#### Stone Salve:

This ointment has two uses. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a petrified creature, it returns the creature to flesh as the _stone to flesh_ spell. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a nonpetrified creature, it protects the creature as a _stoneskin_ spell.

Strong abjuration and transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, _flesh to stone, stoneskin;_ Price 4,000 gp per ounce.

#### Strand of Prayer Beads:

This item appears to be a normal string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and how to activate them. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power.

| Special Bead Type | Special Bead Ability |
| --- | --- |
| Bead of blessing | Wearer can cast _bless._ |
| Bead of healing | Wearer can cast his choice of _cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness,_ or _remove disease._ |
| Bead of karma | Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. |
| Bead of smiting | Wearer can cast _chaos hammer, holy smite, order’s wrath,_ or _unholy blight_ (Will DC 17 partial). |
| Bead of summons | Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for one day. (If the wearer uses the _bead of summons_ to summon a deity’s emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character’s items and places a _geas_ upon him as punishment in the very least.) |
| Bead of wind walking | Wearer can cast _wind walk._ |

A _lesser strand of prayer beads_ has a _bead of blessing_ and a _bead of healing._ A _strand of prayer beads_ has a _bead of healing,_ a _bead of karma,_ and a _bead of smiting._ A _greater strand of prayer beads_ has a _bead of healing,_ a _bead of karma,_ a _bead of summons,_ and a _bead of wind walking._

Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the _bead of summons,_ which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The _beads of blessing, smiting,_ and _wind walking_ function as spell trigger items; the _beads of karma_ and _summons_ can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the _strand of prayer beads_ in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.

The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: _bead of blessing_ –600 gp, _bead of healing_ –9,000 gp, _bead of karma_ –20,000 gp, _bead of smiting_ –16,800 gp, _bead of summons_ –20,000 gp, _bead of wind walking_ –46,800 gp.

Faint, moderate or strong (many schools); CL 1st (_blessing_), 5th (_healing_), 7th (_smiting_), 9th (_karma_), 11th (_wind walking_), 17th (_summons_); Craft Wondrous Items and one of the following spells per bead, as appropriate: _bless_ (_blessing_); _cure serious wounds, remove blindness/ deafness,_ or _remove disease_ (_healing_); _righteous might_ (_karma_); _gate_ (_summons_); _chaos hammer, holy smite, order’s wrath,_ or _unholy blight_ (_smiting_), _wind walk_ (_wind walking_); Price 9,600 gp (lesser), 25,800 gp (standard), 95,800 gp (greater).

#### Sustaining Spoon:

This unremarkable eating utensil is typically fashioned from horn. If the spoon is placed in an empty container the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although this substance has a flavor similar to that of warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _create food and water;_ Price 5,400 gp.

#### Tome of Clear Thought:

This heavy book contains instruction on improving memory and logic, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Intelligence score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book. Because the _tome of clear thought_ provides an inherent bonus, the reader will earn extra skill points when she attains a new level.

Strong evocation (if _miracle_ is used); CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, _miracle_ or _wish;_ Price 27,500 gp (+1), 55,000 gp (+2), 82,500 gp (+3), 110,000 gp (+4), 137,500 gp (+5); Cost 1,250 gp + 5,100 XP (+1), 2,500 gp + 10,200 XP (+2), 3,750 gp + 15,300 XP (+3), 5,000 gp + 20,400 XP (+4), 6,250 gp + 25,500 XP (+5); Weight 5 lb.

#### Tome of Leadership and Influence:

This ponderous book details suggestions for persuading and inspiring others, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, he gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to his Charisma score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.

#### Tome of Understanding:

This thick book contains tips for improving instinct and perception, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Wisdom score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.

#### Unguent of Timelessness:

When applied to any matter that was once alive this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as two Large objects.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; _Prerequisite:_ Craft Wondrous Item; Price 150 gp.

#### Universal Solvent:

This substance has the unique property of being able to dissolve _sovereign glue_ and tanglefoot bags. Applying the solvent is a standard action.

Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, _disintegrate;_ Price 50 gp.

#### Vest of Escape:

Hidden within secret pockets of this simple silk vest are lockpicks that provide a +4 competence bonus on Open Lock checks. The vest also grants its wearer a +6 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.

Faint conjuration and transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, _knock, grease;_ Price 5,200 gp.

#### Vestment, Druid’s:

This light garment is worn over normal clothing or armor. Most such vestments are green, embroidered with plant or animal motifs. When this item is worn by a character with the wild shape ability, the character can use that ability one additional time each day.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _polymorph_ or wild shape ability; Price 10,000 gp.

#### Well of Many Worlds:

This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a _portable hole._ Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world—a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, the random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a _portable hole_ can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily as from the initiating place. (It is a two-way portal.)

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, _gate;_ Price 82,000 gp.

#### Wind Fan:

A _wind fan_ appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering the command word, its possessor causes the fan to generate air movement duplicating a _gust of wind_ spell. The fan can be used once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative chance per usage during that day that the device tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, _gust of wind;_ Price 5,500 gp.

#### Wings of Flying:

A pair of these wings might appear to be nothing more than a plain cloak of old, black cloth, or they could be as elegant as a long cape of blue feathers. When the wearer speaks the command word, the cloak turns into a pair of bat or bird wings that empower her to fly with a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, _fly;_ Price 54,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.
