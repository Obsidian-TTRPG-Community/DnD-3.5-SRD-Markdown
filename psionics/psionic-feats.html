    <h1>PSIONIC FEATS</h1>
    <p>
      Psionic feats are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other words,
      they either have a power point reserve or have psi-like abilities.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Because psionic feats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats do not grant
      supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks
      of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance
      and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a
      <i>null psionics field.</i> Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic
      focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action
      (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended
      it.

    <h2 id="psionic-item-creation-feats">Psionic Item Creation Feats</h2>
    <p>
      Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A
      manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of
      items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.
    </p>
    <p id="xp-cost">
      <strong>XP Cost:</strong> Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a
      psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in
      gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining
      enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the
      XP to advance a level.
    </p>
    <p id="raw-materials-cost">
      <strong>Raw Materials Cost:</strong> Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are
      consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and
      other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such
      as if he’s traveling far from home).
    </p>
    <p id="time">
      <strong>Time:</strong> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum
      time is one day.
    </p>
    <p id="item-cost">
      <strong>Item Cost:</strong> Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that directly reproduce the
      effects of powers, and the strength of these items depends on their manifester level—that is, a power from such an
      item has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that is the minimum
      manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However,
      when making such an item, the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an
      item using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the character’s effective manifester level for
      the purpose of calculating the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation
      is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power points are
      spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective
      manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the
      power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s manifester level must be high enough that the item
      creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s
      manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.
    </p>
    <p id="power-stones"><em>Power Stones:</em> Base price = power level x manifester level x 25 gp</p>
    <p id="psionic-tattoos"><em>Psionic Tattoos:</em> Base price = power level x manifester level x 50 gp</p>
    <p id="dorjes"><em>Dorjes:</em> Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp</p>
    <p id="extra-costs">
      <strong>Extra Costs:</strong> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also
      carries a commensurate cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      For psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the
      creator must pay fifty times the XP cost.
    </p>
    <p>Some psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
    <h2 id="metapsionic-feats">Metapsionic Feats</h2>
    <p>
      As a manifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how
      the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is
      more expensive than manifesting the power normally.
    </p>
    <p id="manifesting-time">
      <strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> Powers manifested using metapsionic feats take the same time as manifesting the
      powers normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise.
    </p>
    <p id="manifestation-cost">
      <strong>Manifestation Cost:</strong> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic
      focus (see the Concentration skill description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat
      description.
    </p>
    <p id="limits-on-use">
      <strong>Limits on Use:</strong> As with all powers, you cannot spend more power points on a power than your
      manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate
      this rule.
    </p>
    <p id="effects-of-metapsionic-feats-on-a-power">
      <strong>Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power:</strong> In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its
      original power level, even though it costs additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a
      metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a metapsionic feat to alter a
      power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.
    </p>
    <p>Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
    <p>Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</p>
    <p id="psionic-items-and-metapsionic-powers">
      <strong>Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers:</strong> With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a
      metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the
      power’s higher metapsionic level.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is
      stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.
    </p>
    <h2 id="feat-descriptions">Feat Descriptions</h2>
    <p>These feat descriptions follow the standard format.</p>
    <h3 id="aligned-attack">Aligned Attack <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your opponent’s alignment-based damage reduction and deals additional
      damage.
    </p>
    <p id="aligned-attack--prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +6.</p>
    <p id="aligned-attack--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law. (Your choice must match
      one of your alignment components. Once you’ve made this alignment choice, it cannot be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you make a successful melee or ranged attack, you deal
      an extra 1d6 points of damage, and your attack is treated as either a good, evil, chaotic, or lawful attack
      (depending on your original choice) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend
      your psionic focus.
    </p>
    <h3 id="antipsionic-magic">Antipsionic Magic <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>Your spells are more potent when used against psionic characters and creatures.</p>
    <p id="antipsionic-magic--prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Spellcraft 5 ranks.</p>
    <p id="antipsionic-magic--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a get a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome a psionic creature’s
      power resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bonus stacks with the bonus conferred by Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration. Moreover, whenever
      a psionic creature attempts to dispel a spell you cast, it makes its manifester level check against a DC of 13 +
      its manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>The benefits of this feat apply only to power resistance.</p>
    <p>The bonus does not apply to spell resistance. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.</p>
    <p id="antipsionic-magic--special">
      <strong>Special:</strong> You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a
      power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
    </p>
    <h3 id="autonomous">Autonomous <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>You have a knack for psionic self-sufficiency.</p>
    <p id="autonomous--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all Autohypnosis checks and Knowledge (psionics) checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="body-fuel">Body Fuel <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You can expand your power point total at the expense of your health.</p>
    <p id="body-fuel--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You can recover 2 power points by taking 1 point of ability burn damage to each of your
      three ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can recover additional power points for a proportional cost to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. These
      recovered points are added to your power point reserve as if you had gained them by resting overnight.
    </p>
    <p id="body-fuel--special">
      <strong>Special:</strong> Only living creatures can use this feat. You can take advantage of this feat only while
      in your own body.
    </p>
    <h3 id="boost-construct">Boost Construct <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>Your astral constructs have more abilities.</p>
    <p id="boost-construct--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When you create an astral construct, you can give it one additional special ability from
      any menu that the construct currently has an ability from.
    </p>
    <h3 id="burrowing-power">Burrowing Power <small>[Metapsionic]</small></h3>
    <p>Your powers sometimes bypass barriers.</p>
    <p id="burrowing-power--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can attempt to manifest your
      powers against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the
      Astral Plane to bypass the barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier
      with your power, you make a Psicraft check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of
      thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a
      <i>wall of ectoplasm</i>). Force walls or <i>walls of ectoplasm</i> are assumed to have less than 1 foot of
      thickness unless noted otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an area),
      you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with
      <i>clairvoyant sense</i>. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost
      cannot exceed your manifester level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="chain-power">Chain Power <small>[Metapsionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You can manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary target.</p>
    <p id="chain-power--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can chain any power that
      affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. After the primary
      target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level (maximum
      twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (round
      down).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each target gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you like,
      but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can
      choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
      manifester level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="chaotic-mind">Chaotic Mind <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>The turbulence of your thoughts prevents others from gaining insight into your actions.</p>
    <p id="chaotic-mind--prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Chaotic alignment, Cha 15.</p>
    <p id="chaotic-mind--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Creatures and characters who have an insight bonus on their attack rolls, an insight
      bonus to their Armor Class, or an insight bonus on skill checks or ability checks do not gain those bonuses
      against you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefit of this feat applies only to insight bonuses gained from psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This
      is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
    </p>
    <p id="chaotic-mind--special">
      <strong>Special:</strong> You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a
      power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

    <h3 id="cloak-dance">Cloak Dance <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>You are skilled at using optical tricks to make yourself seem to be where you are not.</p>
    <p id="cloak-dance--prerequisites"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Hide 10 ranks, Perform (dance) 2 ranks.</p>

      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You can take a move action to obscure your exact position. Until your next turn, you
      have concealment. Alternatively, you can take a full-round action to entirely obscure your exact position. Until
      your next action, you have total concealment.

      <strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can manifest a power as a
      delayed power. A delayed power doesn’t activate immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three
      trigger mechanisms: (1) The power activates when you take a standard action to activate it; (2) It activates when
      a creature enters the area that the power will affect (only powers that affect areas can use this trigger
      condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two triggers and
      the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates automatically on the fifth round.
    </p>
    <p>Only area and personal powers can be delayed.</p>
    <p>
      Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining

      set the manifester level. The manifester level must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and no higher
      than your own level. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power level x its manifester level x 50 gp. To
      scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks, masterwork
      needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price.

      other. If the ray deals damage, each target takes as much damage as a single target would take.

    <p>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2.</p>
    <h3 id="stand-still">Stand Still <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>You can prevent foes from fleeing or closing.</p>
    <p id="stand-still--prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Str 13.</p>
    <p id="stand-still--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When a foe’s movement out of a square you threaten grants you an attack of opportunity,
      you can give up that attack and instead attempt to stop your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity
      normally. If you hit your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage roll (the
      opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he had used up his move actions for the round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you use the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only a number of times

    <h3 id="twin-power">Twin Power <small>[Metapsionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You can manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.</p>
    <p id="twin-power--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can twin a power. Manifesting
      a power altered by this feat causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were
      simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power
      (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target
      experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In
      some cases, such as a twinned <i>psionic charm</i>, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects
      (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target
      from the charm effect).
    </p>

      Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your

    <p>Disabling conditions do not hold you back.</p>
    <p id="unconditional-power--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Your mental strength is enough to
      overcome some otherwise disabling conditions. You can manifest an unconditional power when you are dazed,
      <i>confused,</i> nauseated, shaken, or stunned.
    </p>
    <p>Only personal powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional powers.</p>

      surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end
      your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above
      the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to
      wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks
      of opportunity as you move up the wall.
    </p>
    <p id="up-the-walls--special">
      <strong>Special:</strong> You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance,
      the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is
      within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise,
      you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.

    <h3 id="widen-power">Widen Power <small>[Metapsionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You can increase the area of your powers.</p>
    <p id="widen-power--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter a burst, emanation,
      line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are
      not affected by this feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power’s area increase by 100%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
      manifester level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wild-talent">Wild Talent <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>Your mind wakes to a previously unrealized talent for psionics.</p>
    <p id="wild-talent--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Your latent power of psionics flares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a
      psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats,
      metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers
      simply by virtue of having this feat.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wounding-attack">Wounding Attack <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>Your vicious attacks wound your foe.</p>
    <p id="wounding-attack--prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +8.</p>
    <p id="wounding-attack--benefit">
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can make an attack with such
      vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1 point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition
      to the usual damage dealt.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend
      your psionic focus.
