### Genesis

-   Metacreativity (Creation)
-   **Level:** Shaper 9
-   **Display:** Material
-   **Manifesting Time:** One week (8 hours/day)
-   **Range:** 180 ft.; see text
-   **Effect:** A demiplane coterminous with the Astral Plane, centered
    on your location
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** No
-   **Power Points:** 17, XP

You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes
created by this power are very small, very minor planes. This power
works best when manifested while you are on the Astral Plane.
Manifestation of this power creates a local density fluctuation that
precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane
grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum radius
of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from the surrounding astral
ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn't
really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per
week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per year). Once your
demiplane is created, you can travel to it using *astral caravan*,
*plane shift*, or some other power or permanent link that you arrange
for separately.

You determine the environment within the demiplane when you manifest
*genesis,* reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine
factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of
the terrain. This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor
can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons,
and so forth). You must add these details in some other fashion if you
desire. You can't create lingering psionic effects with this power; you
have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can't create a
demiplane out of esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you're
limited to stone and dirt. You can't manipulate the time trait on your
demiplane; its time trait is as the Material Plane. Once your demiplane
reaches 180 feet in radius, you can manifest this power again to
gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.

Antigenesis: If *genesis* is manifested on the Material Plane, the power
takes effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above,
but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of
the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original
plane, creating a dead spot like a limited cancer on the original plane.
The expanding boundary of the dead spot wipes away all construction,
crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a
uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures that pass the
boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly affected, but plants
can find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing
creatures die quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know
enough to leave the area alone. Once the wave of change passes, no
special essence remains in the dead spot, and it may be colonized
naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and
animals.

*XP Cost:* 1,000 XP.

### Graft Weapon

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 3
-   **Display:** Olfactory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 24 hours (D)
-   **Power Points:** 5

You attach any melee weapon you can use in one hand---mundane, psionic,
or magical---onto the end of one of your arms. The weapon becomes a
natural extension of your arm, and that hand blends seamlessly into the
shaft, hilt, or head of the weapon. Now that the weapon and you are one,
you gain a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls while
using the weapon.

The grafted weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural
weapon for the purpose of effects that distinguish between either weapon
type. For instance, the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon
for the purpose of delivering a touch attack with a power in conjunction
with the weapon attack. As with any power (or spell) melee touch attack
made in conjunction with a natural weapon attack, the touch attack
effect is not delivered unless the natural weapon strikes normally; on a
failed attack, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.

For a psychic warrior under the effect of the *claws of the beast*
power, grafting a weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base
damage of the weapon, instead of the claw upon which a psychic warrior
normally relies.

While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand
and take a --2 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands.
Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorph you can ignore the
grafted weapon or alter it normally, at your discretion. If the weapon
takes damage, you take damage as well. If you are healed, so is your
grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2
points of Constitution; the ability drain persists until you can restore
your natural anatomy (by means of *regenerate* or a similar effect).

When this power's duration expires, the grafted weapon falls to the
ground and your hand returns.

### Grease, Psionic

-   Metacreativity (Creation)
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1
-   **Display:** Visual and olfactory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target or Area:** One object or a 10-ft. square
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** See spell text
-   **Power Resistance:** No
-   **Power Points:** 1

As the *grease* spell, except as noted here.

Sometimes this power is referred to as *ectoplasmic sheen.*

### Grip of Iron

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 immediate action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level
-   **Power Points:** 1

You can improve your chances in a grapple as an immediate action,
gaining a +4 enhancement bonus on your grapple checks.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to
gain the benefit of the power in the current round. Manifesting this
power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it
counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You can
manifest this power when it isn't your turn (if you are grappled).

**Augment:** For every 4 additional power points you spend, the
enhancement bonus on your grapple checks increases by 2.

### Hail of Crystals

-   Metacreativity (Creation)
-   **Level:** Shaper 5
-   **Display:** Auditory and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)
-   **Area:** 20-ft.-radius burst
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
-   **Power Resistance:** No
-   **Power Points:** 9

A tiny ectoplasmic crystal emanates from your outstretched hand and
rapidly expands to a 2-foot-diameter ball of crystal as it speeds toward
the location you designate. You can choose to aim this crystal at a
single target or at a specific point in space (a grid intersection).

If you aim the crystal at a single target, you must make a ranged touch
attack to strike the target. Any creature or object struck by the ball
of crystal takes 5d4 points of bludgeoning damage.

Whether the crystal hits its target, misses, or was aimed at a point in
space, it explodes upon arrival at the location you designated. Anyone
within 20 feet of the explosion takes 9d4 points of slashing damage from
the thousands of crystal shards that spray forth.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power's
damage from the explosion of the crystal increases by 1d4 points.

### Hammer

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Auditory and material
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round
-   **Power Points:** 1

This power charges your touch with the force of a sledgehammer. A
successful melee touch attack deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage.
This damage is not increased or decreased by your Strength modifier.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power's
duration increases by 1 round.

### Hustle

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Egoist 3, psychic warrior 2
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 swift action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Effect:** 1 extra move action
-   **Power Points:** Egoist 5, psychic warrior 3

You gain an additional move action in the current round. Taking a full
round's worth of attacks and then using this power to move away from
your foe does provoke attacks of opportunity.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to
gain the benefit of the power before you move. Manifesting the power is
a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward
the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest
this power when it isn't your turn.

### Hypercognition

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Seer 8
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action or 1 immediate action; see
    text
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Power Points:** 15

You make lightning-fast deductions based on only the slightest clue,
pattern, or scrap of memory resident in your mind. You can make
reasonable statements about a person, place, or object, seemingly from
very little knowledge. However, your knowledge is in fact the result of
a rigorously logical process that you force your mind to undertake,
digging up and correlating every possible piece of knowledge bearing on
the topic (possibly even extracting echoes of knowledge from the Astral
Plane).

The nature of the knowledge you gain concerning the subject of your
analysis might include the answer to a riddle, the way out of a maze,
stray bits of information about a person, legends about a place or an
object, or even a conclusion concerning a dilemma that your conscious
mind is unable to arrive at.

An Intelligence check may be required to obtain the desired information.
If so, you can manifest *hypercognition* as an immediate action prior to
making the check and receive a +20 bonus for doing so.

### Id Insinuation

-   Telepathy (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 2
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. +5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** Concentration + 1 round
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 3

As the *confusion* spell, except as noted here.

Swift tendrils of thought disrupt the unconscious mind of any one
creature, sapping its might. As long as the manifester remains
concentrating fully on this power, the subject is *confused*, making it
unable to independently determine it will do. Roll on the following
table at the beginning of each of the subject's turns to see what the
subject does in that round.

  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d%        Behavior
  01--10    Attack manifester with melee or ranged weapons (or move toward manifester if attack is not possible).
  11--20    Act normally.
  21--50    Do nothing but babble incoherently.
  51--70    Flee from manifester at top possible speed.
  71--100   Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a psicrystal counts as part of the subject's self).
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
save DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional target.
Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of
the power.

### Identify, Psionic

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 2
-   **Display:** Material and mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** One day
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** One touched object
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** No
-   **Power Points:** 3

As the *identify* spell, except as noted here.

This power is used to identify the abilities of psionic items.

### Immovability

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 4
-   **Display:** Visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** Concentration
-   **Power Points:** 7

You are almost impossible to move. Your weight does not vary; instead,
you mentally attach yourself to the underlying fabric of the plane.
Thus, you could conceivably anchor yourself in midair. Any creature
attempting to physically move you must succeed on an opposed Strength
check, and you gain a +20 bonus on the check. You can't voluntarily move
to a new location unless you stop concentrating, which ends the power.

You cannot apply your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class; however, your
anchored body gains damage reduction 15/--.

You cannot make physical attacks or perform any other large-scale
movements (you can make smallscale movements, such as breathing, turning
your head, moving your eyes, talking, and so on). Powers with the
teleportation descriptor, or any telekinetic effect, manifested on you
automatically fail.

**Augment:** If you spend 8 additional power points, you can manifest
this power as an immediate action.

### Incarnate

-   Metacreativity
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 5
-   **Display:** Material
-   **Manifesting Time:** 2 rounds
-   **Range:** See text
-   **Target, Effect, or Area:** See text
-   **Duration:** Permanent; see text
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** No
-   **Power Points:** 9, XP

This power makes certain other powers permanent. Depending on the power
to be affected, you must be of a minimum manifester level and must
expend a number of XP.

You can make the following powers permanent only in regard to yourself.

  ----------------------------- -------------------------- ----------
  Power                         Minimum Manifester Level   XP Cost

  Know direction and location   9th                        500 XP
  My light                      9th                        500 XP
  Psionic darkvision            13th                       1,500 XP
  Psionic tongues               11th                       1,000 XP
  Ubiquitous vision             13th                       1,500 XP
  ----------------------------- -------------------------- ----------

You manifest the desired power and then follow it with the *incarnate*
manifestation.

### Inertial Armor

-   Psychokinesis
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Visual; see text
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
-   **Power Points:** 1; see text

Your mind generates a tangible field of force that provides a +4 armor
bonus to Armor Class. Unlike mundane armor, *inertial armor* entails no
armor check penalty or speed reduction. Because *inertial armor* is
composed of psychokinetic force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it
the way they do normal armor.

Your *inertial armor* can be invisible or can appear as a colored glow,
at your option.

The armor bonus provided by *inertial armor* does not stack with the
armor bonus provided by regular armor.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, the armor
bonus to Armor Class increases by 1.

### Inertial Barrier

-   Psychokinesis
-   **Level:** Kineticist 4, psychic warrior 4
-   **Display:** Auditory and mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 10 min./level
-   **Power Points:** 7

You create a skin-tight psychokinetic barrier around yourself that
resists blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes, as well as providing some
protection against falling. You gain damage reduction 5/--. *Inertial
barrier* also absorbs half the damage you take from any fall.

### Inflict Pain

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 2
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will partial; see text
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 3

You telepathically stab the mind of your foe, causing horrible agony.
The subject suffers wracking pain that imposes a --4 penalty on attack
rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. If the target makes its save,
it takes only a --2 penalty.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
save DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional target.
Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of
the power.

### Insanity

-   Telepathy (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 7
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standardaction
-   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 13

As the *confusion* spell, except as noted here.

Creatures affected by this power are permanently *confused* and
constantly behave randomly. Roll on the following table at the beginning
the subject's turn each round to see what the subject does in that
round.

  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d%        Behavior
  01--10    Attack manifester with melee or ranged weapons (or move toward manifester if attack is not possible).
  11--20    Act normally.
  21--50    Do nothing but babble incoherently.
  51--70    Flee from manifester at top possible speed.
  71--100   Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a psicrystal counts as part of the subject's self).
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only *psychic chirurgery*, *reality revision*, and other similarly
extreme measures can restore the subject's sanity.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
save DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional target.
Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of
the power.

### Intellect Fortress

-   Psychokinesis
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 4
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 immediate action
-   **Range:** 20 ft.
-   **Area:** 20-ft.-radius spread centered on you
-   **Duration:** 1 round
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 7

You encase yourself and your allies in a shimmering fortress of
telekinetic force. All damage from powers and psi-like abilities taken
by subjects inside the area of the *intellect fortress,* including
ability damage, is halved. This lowering takes place prior to the
effects of other powers or abilities that lessen damage, such as damage
reduction and evasion.

Powers that are not subject to power resistance are not affected by an
*intellect fortress.*

You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its
benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action,
like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal
limit of one quickened power per round. You can use this power even when
it's not your turn.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power's
duration increases by 1 round.

### Iron Body, Psionic

-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 8
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action

    ft./level

-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Power Points:** 1

You generally know where you are. This power is useful to characters who
end up at unfamiliar destinations after teleporting, using a *gate,* or
traveling to or from other planes of existence. The power reveals
general information about your location as a feeling or presentiment.
The information is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates
you according to a prominent local or regional site. Using this power
also tells you what direction you are facing.

Using this power prior to making a Knowledge (the planes) check with
*astral caravan* grants a +2 bonus on the check.

### Leech Field

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 5
-   **Display:** Visual; see text
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal; see text
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min.
-   **Power Points:** 9

You raise a field of potentiality that drains the vitality from powers
that you successfully save against. When you succeed on a saving throw
to negate the effect of a foe's power on you, and the power is one that
*leech field* is effective against (see below), your body erupts in a
brief flash of crackling dark energy. You gain 1 power point for every 2
power points your foe spent to manifest the power you just saved against
(to a maximum number of points equal to your manifester level). You
cannot gain power points that would cause you to exceed your normal
daily maximum.

This power is effective against any power that targets a single creature
and allows the target a saving throw to negate it, except those that are
delivered by a touch attack or a ranged touch attack (including a ray).

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
duration increases by 1 minute.

### Levitate, Psionic

-   Psychoportation
-   **Level:** Nomad 2, psion/wilder 2, psychic warrior 2
-   **Display:** Olfactory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** You or one willing creature or one object (total weight
    up to 100 lb./level)
-   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless, object)
-   **Power Points:** 3

As the *levitate* spell, except as noted here.

**Special:** When a psion, wilder, or a psychic warrior manifests this
power, the target is the manifester (not a willing creature or an
object).

### Major Creation, Psionic

-   Metacreativity (Creation)
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 5
-   **Manifesting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Duration:** See spell text
-   **Power Points:** 9

As the *major creation* spell, except as noted here.

### Matter Agitation

-   Psychokinesis
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1
-   **Display:** Auditory and material
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Area:** 2 sq. ft. of surface area of an object or creature
-   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 1

You can excite the structure of a nonpsionic, nonmagical object, heating
it to the point of combustion over time. The agitation grows more
intense in the second and third rounds after you manifest the power, as
described below.

*1st Round:* Readily flammable material (paper, dry grass, tinder,
torches) ignites. Skin reddens (1 point of damage).

*2nd Round:* Wood smolders and smokes, metal becomes hot to the touch,
skin blisters (1d4 points of damage), hair smolders, paint shrivels,
water boils.

*3rd and Subsequent Rounds:* Wood ignites, metal scorches (1d4 points of
damage for those holding metallic objects). Skin burns and hair ignites
(1d6 points of damage), lead melts.

### Matter Manipulation

-   Metacreativity
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 8
-   **Display:** Auditory and mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Area:** 1 cu. ft./level of inanimate material
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 15, XP

You can weaken or strengthen the substance of an object or structure.
You can affect both mundane and magical inanimate material. Weakening an
object's substance decreases its hardness and hit points, and
strengthening it increases its hardness and hit points. You can increase
or decrease an object's hardness by up to 5 from its original hardness.
When hardness increases, the object (or portion of an object) gains 3
hit points per inch of thickness for every point of increased hardness.
When hardness decreases, the object (or portion of an object) loses 2
hit points per inch of thickness for every point of decreased hardness
(to a minimum of 1 hit point per inch of thickness).

You can't decrease the hardness of an object that already has hardness
0.

*Working Manipulated Metals:* An object or portion thereof whose
hardness is decreased or increased is permanently changed. Even
hardening adamantine to 25 is possible. You can also harden or weaken a
preforged weapon, a suit of armor, or some other finished item.

*XP Cost:* 250 XP for each point by which the object's hardness is
altered.

### Mental Barrier

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 3, psychic warrior 3
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 immediate action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round
-   **Power Points:** 5

You project a field of improbability around yourself, creating a
fleeting protective shell. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to Armor
Class.

You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its
benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action,
like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal
limit of one quickened power per round. You can use this power even when
it's not your turn; however, you must manifest it prior to an opponent's
attack roll in order to gain this power's benefit against that attack.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following
ways.

1\. If you spend 4 additional power points, the deflection bonus to
Armor Class increases by 1.

2\. For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration
increases by 1 round.

### Mental Disruption

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 2
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 10 ft.
-   **Area:** 10-ft.-radius spread centered on you
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 3

You generate a mental wave of confusion that instantly sweeps out from
your location. All creatures you designate in the affected area (you can
choose certain creatures to be unaffected) must make a Will save or
become dazed for 1 round.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following
ways.

1\. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save DC
increases by 1.

2\. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's range
and the radius of its area both increase by 5 feet.

### Metaconcert

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 5, telepath 5
-   **Display:** Visual; see text
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 20 ft.
-   **Target:** You and up to nine other willing psionic creatures in
    range
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
-   **Power Points:** 9

You link your psychic might with other psionic creatures, creating an
entity more powerful than the sum of its parts.

When you manifest this power, a number of power points you designate
flows from each participant into a collective pool. One individual is
chosen as the *metaconcert* conductor by mutual consent of the other
participants (this is usually the manifester, but doesn't have to be).
Until the power ends, this conductor directs the efforts of the group.
Misty strands of glowing power link the brows of all the participants in
a complex and shifting pattern.

All the powers of each participant are known to the mental entity
ccreated with *metaconcert* (which is under the conductor's command).
This entity can't take any more actions than a normal individual, but it
manifests all its powers more effectively. Each participant contributing
to the entity provides a cumulative +1 bonus to save DCs that apply when
manifesting a power or using a psi-like ability. Likewise, each
individual provides a cumulative +1 bonus when the entity makes its own
saving throws in response to powers or psi-like abilities.

If the psionic entity takes ability damage from a psionic attackthe
total is divided among all the members as determined by the conductor.

If the entity manifests a power that has an XP cost, all the
participants pay an equal share (the conductor pays the remainder if the
cost can't be divided evenly).

Once linked, the participants must remain within a 20-foot-radius area,
and as a group can move at a speed of 10 feet. If a participant moves
outside the 20-foot-radius area occupied by the others (whether
willingly or involuntarily), that individual drops out of the group, and
the power point pool of the *metaconcert* is instantly recalculated.

All participants who leave before a *metaconcert* ends or is dismissed
reclaim a number of power points equal to the current power point pool
divided by the number of members. If the conductor drops out, the power
ends. That same number of points is removed from the power point pool.

When a *metaconcert* ends normally or is dismissed, remaining power
points in the pool are divided among all the participants (the conductor
receives the remainder if the points can't be divided evenly).

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power's
duration increases by 1 minute.

### Metafaculty

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Seer 9
-   **Display:** Mental, olfactory, and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 hour
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous and 1 min./level (D); see text
-   **Power Points:** 17, XP

You elevate your mind to a near-universal consciousness, cogitating
countless impressions and predictions involving any creature you have
seen before, whether personally or by means of another power such as
*remote viewing*.

This process gives you an uncannily accurate vision of the creature's
nature, activities, and whereabouts. When you manifest the power, you
learn the following facts about the creature.

-   Its name, race, alignment, and character class.
-   A general estimate of its level or Hit Dice: low (5 HD or lower),
    medium (6 to 11 HD), high (12 to 20 HD), very high (21 HD to 40 HD),
    or deific (41 HD or higher).
-   Its location (including place of residence, town, country, world,
    and plane of existence).
-   Significant items currently in its possession.
-   Any significant activities or actions the creature has undertaken in
    the previous 8 hours, including details such as locales traveled
    through, the names or races of those the creature fought, spells it
    cast, items it acquired, and items it left behind (including the
    location of those items).
-   A current mental view of the creature, as described in the *remote
    viewing* power, which you can maintain for up to 1 minute per level.

*Metafaculty* can defeat spells, powers, and special abilities such as
*screen* or *mind blank* (or even a *wish* spell) that normally obscure
clairsentience powers. You can attempt a caster level check (DC 6 +
caster level of the creator of the obscuring effect) to defeat these
sorts of otherwise impervious defenses.

*Metafaculty* is defeated by epic powers, epic spells, and epic special
abilities that obscure divinations and clairsentience powers.

*XP Cost:* 1,000.

### Metamorphosis

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Egoist 4
-   **Display:** Material and olfactory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D) for a creature; 1 hour/level (D) for
    an object
-   **Power Points:** 7

You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form,
or any other type except construct, elemental, outsider, and undead. The
assumed form can have as many Hit Dice as your manifester level, to a
maximum of 15.

You can't assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you assume an
incorporeal, ectoplasmic, or gaseous form. You cannot take the form of
any creature that has a template. Your type and subtype (if applicable)
change to match the new form.

Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a
night (though this healing does not restore ability damage and provide
other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal you further).
If you are slain while under the effect of this power, you revert to
your original form, though you remain dead. You gain the Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retain your own
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also gain all
extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict,
improved grab, and poison) but do not gain the extraordinary special
qualities possessed by the new form (such as blindsense, fast healing,
regeneration, and scent) or any supernatural, psionic, or spelllike
abilities.

You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and special
qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part
that the new form does not have, if any. You keep all extraordinary
special attacks and special qualities derived from class levels, but you
lose any benefits of the racial traits of your normal form. If you have
a template, special abilities it provides are likewise not retained. If
the assumed form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You
retain any manifesting ability you had in your original form.

You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your
own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement
capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight
with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for
nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws
or a bite), racial bonuses on skill checks, racial bonus feats, and any
anatomical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of
extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you
to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than
normal.

You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such
as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges
for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical
qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your
control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's species.
You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's
race. If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on
your Disguise check.

When the change occurs, your equipment either remains worn or held by
the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item in
question) or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you
revert to your normal form, any objects previously melded into the new
form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied
and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed
form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet;
any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to
both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are
still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment
that is separated from the whole reverts to its normal form.

You can also use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object.
You gain the object's hardness and retain your own hit points. You can
take the shape of almost any simple object you can think of. If you
attempt to take the form of a complex object, you must make an
appropriate skill check.. If you fail the check, your manifestation of
the power does not succeed. Likewise, you cannot take the form of a
complex mechanical mechanism unless you have some sort of skill
associated with the object. You cannot use this power to assume the form
of a psionic item or a magic item, or any object with a hardness of 15
or higher. You also cannot take the form of a psionically animated
mechanism or any object formed of ectoplasm.

As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility. You retain your normal
senses and your ability to speak. You can manifest a power if you make a
Concentration check (DC 20 + power level); however, doing so ends the
duration of this power. If you take damage while in the form of an
object, your actual body also takes damage (but the object's hardness,
if any, protects you).

### Metamorphosis, Greater

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Egoist 9
-   **Display:** Material and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D) for a creature; 1 hour/level (D) for
    an object
-   **Power Points:** 17, XP

As *metamorphosis*, except that this power enables you to assume the
form of any single nonunique object or creature (of any type) from Fine
to Colossal size. The assumed form cannot have more Hit Dice than twice
your manifester level (to a maximum of 50 HD). Unlike *metamorphosis*,
this power allows incorporeal, ectoplasmic, or gaseous forms to be
assumed.

You gain all extraordinary and supernatural abilities (both special
attacks and special qualities) of the assumed form, but you lose your
own supernatural abilities. You also gain the type of the new form (for
example, dragon or magical beast) in place of your own. The new form
does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces of equipment that
are separated from you do not revert to their original form.

You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change
form once each round as a swift action.

The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or
immediately after it, but not during the action.

If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your
Disguise check.

As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility; however, you retain your
ability to manifest powers normally.

*XP Cost:* 200 XP.

### Metaphysical Claw

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level
-   **Power Points:** 1

If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from
an effect such as *claws of the beast*) or a bite attack (which could be
a natural bite attack or one you gain by means of the power *bite of the
wolf* ), you can use this power to provide one of your natural weapons a
+1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

**Augment:** If you spend 4 additional power points, this power's
duration increases to 1 hour per level.

In addition, for every 4 additional power points you spend, this power
improves the natural weapon's enhancement bonus on attack rolls and
damage rolls by 1.

### Metaphysical Weapon

-   Metacreativity
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Weapon touched
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless, object)
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless, object)
-   **Power Points:** 1

*Metaphysical weapon* gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack
rolls and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a
masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.)

Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The
projectiles must be of the same type, and they have to be together (such
as in the same quiver). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their
enhancement when used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than
thrown weapons, for the purpose of this power.)

You can't manifest this power on most natural weapons, including a
psychic warrior's claw strike. This power does work on a weapon brought
into being by the *graft weapon* power.

**Augment:** If you spend 4 additional power points, this power's
duration increases to 1 hour per level.

In addition, for every 4 additional power points you spend, this power
improves the weapon's enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls
by 1.

### Microcosm

-   Telepathy (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 9
-   **Display:** Material
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target or Area:** One creature; or one or more creatures within a
    15-ft.-radius sphere
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 17

This power enables you to warp the consciousness and senses of one or
more creatures, sending the victim into a catatonic state. When
*microcosm* is manifested, you can target either a single creature
within range or a group of creatures all located within the power's
area.

*Single Target:* If *microcosm* targets a single creature, that
creature's senses are pinched off from the real world if it currently
has 100 or fewer hit points. The subject's senses are all completely
fabricated from within its own mind, though it may not realize this. In
reality, the subject sprawls limply, drooling and mewling, and
eventually dies of thirst and starvation without care. The subject lives
within its own made-up world until the time of its actual death.

*Area Effect:* If *microcosm* is manifested on an area, it sends all
affected creatures into a shared catatonia (the world is a construct,
but within the world, the victims can interact with each other). It
affects only creatures that currently have 30 or fewer hit points, and
only up to a total of 300 hit points of such creatures. The power
affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first. (Creatures
with negative hit points count as having 0 hit points.)

Manifesting *microcosm* a second time on an affected creature turns its
sensory pathways outward once more. Otherwise, only very potent powers
(such as *psychic chirurgery* or *reality revision*) or similar effects
(such as *miracle* or *wish*) can undo the mental crosswiring that this
power brings about.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, the number of
individual and group hit points the power can affect increases by 10.

### Mind Blank, Personal

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 7, psychic warrior 6
-   **Display:** Olfactory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** One day
-   **Power Points:** Psion/wilder 13, psychic warrior 11

As *psionic mind blank* (see below), except as noted here.

### Mind Blank, Psionic

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 8
-   **Display:** Olfactory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** One day
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **Power Points:** 15

The subject is protected from all devices, powers, and spells that
detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This power protects
against powers with the mind-affecting or scrying descriptors. *Psionic
mind blank* even foils *bend reality, limited wish, miracle, reality
revision,* and *wish* when they are used in such a way as to affect the
subject's mind or to gain information about it (however, *metafaculty*
can pierce the protective quality of *psionic mind blank*). In the case
of *remote viewing* or scrying that scans an area the creature is in,
the effect works but the creature simply isn't detected. *Remote
viewing* (scrying) attempts that are targeted specifically at the
subject do not work at all.

### Mind Probe

-   Telepathy (Charm) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Telepath 5
-   **Display:** Auditory, material, and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will partial; see text
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 9

All the subject's memories and knowledge are accessible to you, from
memories deep below the surface to those still easily called to mind.
You can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the
subject's knowledge. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is not
required to answer the question; however, making a save does not end the
power. You can ask the subject a new question (or the same question) in
subsequent rounds for as long as the power's duration persists.

You can probe a sleeping subject and automatically get an answer to your
question. If the subject then succeeds on a Will save, it wakes after
providing the answer and thereafter can resist answering by making Will
saves as described above.

Subjects that do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the
power's range, unless they are somehow hindered. You pose the questions
telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly
to your mind. You and the subject do not need to speak the same
language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only
appropriate visual images in answer to your questions.

### Mind Seed

-   Telepathy (Compulsion) \[Evil, Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Telepath 8
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** One touched Medium or smaller humanoid
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous; see text
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 15, XP

You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject's subconscious.
If successfully implanted, the seed of your mind "germinates" over the
period of one week. During this time, the subject begins to
unconsciously take on your mannerisms.

When integration is complete (after one week), the subject becomes you
in mind as you were when you manifested the power, but the subject's
level is eight lower than your own. (In effect, the subject has received
eight negative levels---but these are negative levels that can't be
removed.) The subject does not have any of your physical ability scores
or equipment, but does have the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
scores you had when you were eight levels lower. The subject also knows
the powers you knew when you were eight levels lower.

While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two
personalities diverge over time. Although the subject starts off with
memories of your experiences, it possesses its original "soul" and
physical body and is free to develop its own personality based on its
own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave or servant, but
instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier
memories.

*Protection from evil* or a similar spell or power can prevent you from
implanting *mind seed,* or prevent a seed from germinating while the
protective power lasts. Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed
(prior to germination) only by *psychic chirurgery, reality revision*,
or similarly high-level effects. Manifesting *mind seed* again during
the germination period also cleanses the subject's mind.

*XP Cost:* 3,000 XP.

### Mind Switch

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Telepath 6
-   **Display:** Visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 round
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Targets:** You and one other creature
-   **Duration:** 10 min./level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 11, XP

You can attempt to take control of a nearby living creature, forcing
your mind (and soul) into its body, and its mind into your body. You can
target any creature whose Hit Dice are equal to or less than your
manifester level.

You possess the target's body and force the creature's mind into your
body unless it succeeds on a Will save. You can move your mind back into
your own body whenever you desire, which returns the subject's mind to
its own body and ends the power. If the manifestation succeeds, your
life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force takes over
yours.

You can call on rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject
creature, but not upon its acquired or learned knowledge (such as skills
and feats it possesses). The same is true for the subject in your body.
The *mind switch* brings about the following changes.

-   You gain the type of your assumed body.
-   You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of your
    assumed body.
-   You gain the natural armor, natural attacks, movement, and other
    simple physical characteristics of your assumed body.
-   You gain the extraordinary special attacks and qualities of your
    assumed body, but you do not gain supernatural or spell-like
    abilities.
-   You gain the possessions and equipment of your assumed body.
-   You retain your own hit points, saving throws (possibly modified by
    new ability scores), class abilities, supernatural and spell-like
    abilities, spells and powers, and skills and feats (although skill
    checks use your new ability scores, and you may be temporarily
    unable to use feats whose requirements you do not meet in your new
    body).

Supernatural abilities that require a certain body part may be
unavailable in your new form.

If either body is killed while the power is in effect, the other
participant also dies when the power ends. If one participant's body
becomes petrified, imprisoned by *temporal stasis* or *imprisonment,* or
incapacitated in some other way, the other participant will be
incapacitated in that way when the power ends.

A targeted *dispel psionics* (or similar spells or effects) successfully
manifested on either participant causes both minds to return to their
original bodies.

*XP Cost:* 100 XP.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
save DC increases by 1.

### Mind Switch, True

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Telepath 9
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 17, XP

As *mind switch,* except as noted here. You permanently exchange bodies
with the subject. Since this power's duration is instantaneous, you
cannot be forced to return to your natural body by means of *dispel
psionics,* an *antimagic field,* or a similar effect. If the subject's
body dies while you are in it, you are dead. The subject immediately
loses one level, but otherwise survives the experience in your natural
body. If your natural body dies while the subject is in it, you
immediately lose one level, but you likewise survive the experience in
your new body.

Your "natural" body is always considered to be the last one you switched
out of. If you exchange bodies with a chain of multiple subjects, you
need worry only about the welfare of the last body you switched with. In
other words, if your mind is expelled from your current body, your mind
returns to the last body you switched with, not to your original body.
Similarly, if your original body dies but you have since switched minds
with a second subject, you take no penalty. You lose a level only if the
body you inhabited immediately prior to your current body is killed.

*XP Cost:* 10,000 XP.

### Mind Thrust

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 1

You instantly deliver a massive assault on the thought pathways of any
one creature, dealing 1d10 points of damage to it.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power's
damage increases by 1d10 points. For each extra 2d10 points of damage,
this power's save DC increases by 1.

### Mind Trap

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 3
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 immediate action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **Power Points:** 5

You set up a trap in your mind against psionic intruders. Anyone who
attacks you with a telepathy power immediately loses 1d6 power points.
This power's effect does not negate the power that is currently being
used against you. You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough
to gain its benefit in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an
immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts
toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You can use
this power even when it is not your turn.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power's
duration increases by 1 round.

### Mindlink

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Telepath 1
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text
-   **Targets:** You and one other willing creature within range that
    has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher
-   **Duration:** 10 min./level
-   **Saving Throw:** None; see text
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **Power Points:** 1

You forge a telepathic bond with your target. You can communicate
telepathically through the bond even if you do not share a common
language. No special power or influence is established as a result of
the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although
not from one plane to another).

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following
ways.

1\. If you spend 4 additional power points, you can attempt to create a
telepathic bond with a creature that is not willing (Will save negates).

2\. For every additional power point you spend, this power can affect an
additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet
from another target of the power.

### Mindlink, Thieving

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Telepath 4
-   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 7

As *mindlink*, except that if the target is a psionic character or
creature that knows powers, you can temporarily borrow a power of your
choice (you are aware of what powers the subject knows, up to the
highest level of power you can manifest).

Borrowing the subject's power is a separate standard action that
provokes an attack of opportunity. If that attack succeeds, the mental
communication provided by this power ends immediately. The borrowed
power fades from the subject's awareness and appears within your own.
You can now spend power points to manifest the borrowed power just as if
it were one of your powers known. You maintain knowledge of the borrowed
power until the duration of your *thieving mindlink* expires, at which
time you lose knowledge of the power and the power reappears in the mind
of the subject, no matter how far from you the subject is. Even if the
subject is slain, you lose knowledge of the borrowed power when this
power's duration expires.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
save DC increases by 1.

### Mindwipe

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 4
-   **Display:** Auditory, mental, and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 7

You partially wipe your victim's mind of past experiences, bestowing two
negative levels upon it. If the subject has at least as many negative
levels as Hit Dice, it dies. For each negative level it gains, a psionic
creature loses knowledge of one power from its highest available level,
and a number of power points from its maximum power point total
sufficient to manifest that power. The effects of multiple negative
levels stack.

If the subject survives, it loses these two negative levels after 1
hour. (No Fortitude save is necessary to avoid gaining the negative
level permanently.)

**Augment:** You can manifest this power in one or both of the following
ways.

1\. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save DC
increases by 1.

2\. For every 3 additional power points you spend, this power bestows an
additional negative level on the subject.

### Minor Creation, Psionic

    plant matter, up to 1 cu. ft./level
-   **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** No

### Missive

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting, Language-Dependent\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Effect:** Mental message delivered to subject
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 1

You send a telepathic message of up to ten words to any living creature
within range. *Missive* is strictly a one-way exchange from you to the
subject. If you do not share a common language, the subject "hears"
meaningless mental syllables.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
range increases by 5 feet and its save DC increases by 1.

### Missive, Mass

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting, Language-Dependent\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 2
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
-   **Targets:** All creatures in a 400 ft. + 40 ft./level radius
    centered on you; see text
-   **Effect:** Mental message delivered to subjects
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **Power Points:** 3

You send a telepathic message of up to twenty-five words to all
creatures within range. You can include or exclude from this broadcast
any creature you can see, as well as any creature that you know or know
of. *Mass missive* is strictly a one-way exchange from you to the
subjects. If you do not share a common language, the subjects "hear"
meaningless mental syllables.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
range increases by 40 feet and its save DC increases by 1.

### Modify Memory, Psionic

-   Telepathy (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Telepath 4
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** Permanent
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 7

As the *modify memory* spell, except as noted here.

### Moment of Prescience, Psionic

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 7
-   **Display:** Visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level or until discharged
-   **Power Points:** 13

As the *moment of prescience* spell, except as noted here.

### My Light

-   Psychokinesis \[Light\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Auditory and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Effect:** 20-ft. cone of light emanating from you
-   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
-   **Power Points:** 1

Your eyes beam forth a 20-foot cone of light. You and other creatures
can see normally in the light. If you walk into an area filled with
psionic or magical darkness, *my light* goes dark while you stay within
that area.

If *my light* is used in conjunction with *elfsight*, the cone of light
extends out to 40 feet instead of 20 feet.

**Augment:** If you spend 2 additional power points, you can manifest
this power as a swift action.

### Null Psionics Field

-   Psychokinesis
-   **Level:** Kineticist 6
-   **Display:** Auditory and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 10 ft.
-   **Area:** 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you
-   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** See text
-   **Power Points:** 11

An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within
this barrier is impervious to most psionic effects, including powers,
psi-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents
the functioning of any psionic items or powers within its confines. A
*null psionics field* suppresses any power or psionic effect used
within, brought into, or manifested into its area, but does not negate
it. Time spent within a *null psionics field* counts against a
suppressed effect's duration.

Astral constructs and summoned creatures wink out if they enter a *null
psionics field*. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes
away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the
power that is maintaining the construct or summoned creature.

Creation powers with instantaneous durations and calling powers are not
affected by a *null psionics field* because the power itself is no
longer in effect, only its result.

A normal creature (a normally encountered construct rather than a
created one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles.
Furthermore, while a psionic sword does not function psionically within
the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The
power has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with
magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting
(unless they have been summoned or have a limited duration, in which
case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals,
corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned.
These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be
temporarily nullified by the field.

*Dispel psionics* does not remove the field. Two or more *null psionics
fields* sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other.
Certain powers may be unaffected by *null psionics field* (see the
individual power descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by
mortal power such as this. Should a creature's space extend across the
boundary of the area enclosed by the field, any part of the creature
that lies outside the effect is unaffected by the field.

### Oak Body

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 7, psychic warrior 5
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
-   **Power Points:** Psion/wilder 13, psychic warrior 9

This power transforms your body into living oak, which grants you
several advantages.

You gain damage reduction 10/ slashing and a +5 bonus to natural armor
that overlaps (does not stack with) any natural armor bonus you may
already have. You are immune to ability damage, blindness, deafness,
disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all powers, spells, or attacks
that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no
physiology or respiration while this power is in effect.

You take only half damage from cold effects of all kinds. However, you
become susceptible to all special attacks that affect wood, and you gain
vulnerability to fire.

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but you take a --2 penalty
to Dexterity (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is
reduced to half normal. You can speak but cannot drink (and thus can't
use potions) or play wind instruments. You have an armor check penalty
of --4 and an arcane spell failure chance of 25%.

Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for
Small characters, 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered
armed when making unarmed attacks. When you make a full attack against
an object or structure using your unarmed strike, you deal double
damage.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power's
duration increases by 1 minute.

### Object Reading

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Seer 2
-   **Display:** Auditory and material
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Object touched
-   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 3

You can learn details of an inanimate object's previous owner. Objects
accumulate psychic impressions left by their previous owners, which can
be read by use of this power. The amount of information revealed depends
on how long you study a particular object.

*1st Minute:* Last owner's race.

*2nd Minute:* Last owner's gender.

*3rd Minute:* Last owner's age.

*4th Minute:* Last owner's alignment.

*5th Minute:* How last owner gained and lost the object.

*6th+ Minute:* Next-to-last owner's race, and so on.

The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item, and
the original owner (if you keep the power active long enough).

There is a 90% chance that this power will successfully identify all
other former owners in sequence, but there is a 10% chance that one
former owner will be skipped and thus not identified.

This power will not identify casual users as owners. (Anyone who uses an
object to attack someone or something is not thereafter considered a
casual user.)

An object without any previous owners reveals no information. You can
continue to run through a list of previous owners and learn details
about them as long as the power's duration lasts. If you use this power
additional times on the same object, the information yielded is the same
as if you were using the power on the object for the first time.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, this power's
maximum duration increases by 10 minutes.

### Overland Flight, Psionic

-   Psychoportation
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 6
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
-   **Power Points:** 11

As the *overland flight* spell, except as noted here.

### Painful Strike

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 2
-   **Display:** Material and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level
-   **Power Points:** 3

Your natural weapons cause additional pain. Each successful attack you
make with a natural weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of nonlethal damage
to the target.

**Augment:** If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest
this power as a swift action.

### Personality Parasite

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 4
-   **Display:** Auditory and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)
-   **Target:** One Medium or smaller humanoid
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 7

You attempt to briefly partition the mind of your foe, calving off a
minor personality that is antagonistic to the main personality. The
parasitic personality functions with complete autonomy from the main
personality. It does not control the body physically, but it can take
one standard action each round that is purely mental, such as
manifesting a power, in the same turn that the subject takes its normal
actions.

The parasitic personality manifests powers using the subject's power
point reserve and known powers, but can only manifest powers three or
more levels lower than the highest level of power the subject can
normally manifest.

The parasitic personality actively attempts to manifest powers that
negatively impact the subject, using the highest-level powers possible
(so as to deplete the subject's power point reserve), and the most
deadly to the subject. You do not have control over what the parasitic
personality does, though it always works against the interest of the
subject.

Both minds communicate with each other telepathically. If a creature is
targeted by a compulsion or charm effect while under the effect of this
power, it can make a second saving throw if the first one fails. If both
saving throws fail, then this power ends and the creature is affected by
the charm or compulsion effect.

The parasitic personality does not gain any advantages if the main
personality is subjected to a *haste* or *schism* effect.

### Phase Door, Psionic

-   Psychoportation
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 7
-   **Display:** Visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 0 ft.
-   **Effect:** Ethereal 5-ft. by 8-ft. opening, 10 ft. deep + 5 ft.
    deep per three levels
-   **Duration:** One usage per two levels
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** No
-   **Power Points:** 13

As the *phase door* spell, except as noted here. This power is subject
to *dispel psionics.*

### Plane Shift, Psionic

-   Psychoportation
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 5
-   **Display:** Visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Targets:** Willing creature touched, or up to eight willing
    creatures joining hands
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Power Points:** 9

As the *plane shift* spell, except as noted here.

### Power Leech

-   Telepathy (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 4
-   **Display:** Visual; see text
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** Any psionic creature
-   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round/level; see text
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 7

Your brow erupts with an arc of crackling dark energy that connects with
your foe, draining it of 1d6 power points and adding 1 of those points
to your reserve (unless that gain would cause you to exceed your
maximum).

The drain continues in each round you maintain concentration while the
subject of the drain remains in range. If the subject is drained to 0
power points, this power ends.

Concentrating to maintain *power leech* is a full-round action (you can
take no other actions aside from a 5-foot step) instead of a standard
action.

### Power Resistance

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 5
-   **Display:** Material and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **Power Points:** 9

The creature gains power resistance equal to 12 + your manifester level.

### Precognition

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Seer 1
-   **Display:** Visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 10 min./level
-   **Power Points:** 1

*Precognition* allows your mind to glimpse fragments of potential future
events---what you see will probably happen if no one takes action to
change it. However, your vision is incomplete, and it makes no real
sense until the actual events you glimpsed begin to unfold. That's when
everything begins to come together, and you can act, if you act swiftly,
on the information you previously received when you manifested this
power.

In practice, manifesting this power grants you a "precognitive edge."
Normally, you can have only a single precognitive edge at one time. You
must use your edge within a period of no more than 10 minutes per level,
at which time your preknowledge fades and you lose your edge.

You can use your precognitive edge in a variety of ways. Essentially,
the edge translates into a +2 insight bonus that you can apply at any
time to either an attack roll, a damage roll, a saving throw, or a skill
check. You can elect to apply the bonus to the roll after you determine
that your unmodified roll is lower than desired.

### Precognition, Defensive

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Material and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
-   **Power Points:** 1

Your awareness extends a fraction of a second into the future, allowing
you to better evade an opponent's blows.

You gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and on all saving throws. If caught in
a situation where your Dexterity bonus isn't applied to your Armor
Class, this bonus to AC and saving throws does not apply.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following
ways.

1\. For every 3 additional power points you spend, the insight bonus
gained increases by 1.

2\. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power
as a swift action.

### Precognition, Greater

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Seer 6
-   **Display:** Auditory and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 hour/level
-   **Power Points:** 11

As *precognition,* except as noted here.

You gain a +4 insight bonus instead of a +2 bonus.

### Precognition, Offensive

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Material and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action; see text
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
-   **Power Points:** 1

Your awareness extends a fraction of a second into the future, allowing
you to better land blows against your opponent. You gain a +1 insight
bonus on your attack rolls.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following
ways.

1\. For every 3 additional power points you spend, the insight bonus
gained on your attack rolls increases by 1.

2\. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power
as a swift action.

### Prescience, Offensive

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Material and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
-   **Power Points:** 1

Your awareness extends a fraction of a second into the future, allowing
you to better aim blows against your opponent. You gain a +2 insight
bonus on your damage rolls.

**Augment:** You can augment this power in one or both of the following
ways.

1\. For every 3 additional power points you spend, the insight bonus
gained on your attack rolls increases by 1.

2\. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power
as a swift action.

### Prevenom

-   Psychometabolism (Creation)
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 1
-   **Display:** Material
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level or until discharged
-   **Power Points:** 1

If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from
an effect such as *claws of the beast*), you can use this power to
produce a mild venom that coats one of your claws. On your next
successful melee attack, the venom deals 2 points of Constitution
damage. A target struck by the poison can make a Fortitude save (DC 10 +
1/2 your manifester level + your key ability modifier) to negate the
damage.

**Augment:** For every 6 additional power points you spend, this power's
Constitution damage increases by 2 points.

### Prevenom Weapon

-   Psychometabolism (Creation)
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 1
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Weapon touched
-   **Power Points:** 1

As *prevenom*, except your weapon gains the poison coating as long as it
remains in your grip.

### Prowess

-   Clairsentience
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 2
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 immediate action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Power Points:** 3

If an enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you can make the
attack even if you've already taken your allotted number of attacks of
opportunity this round (usually one).

You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain an extra
attack of opportunity in the same round. Manifesting this power is an
immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts
toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round.

### Psionic Blast

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 3
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 30 ft.
-   **Area:** 30-ft. cone-shaped burst
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 5

The air ripples with the force of your mental attack, which blasts the
minds of all creatures in range. *Psionic blast* stuns all affected
creatures for 1 round.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, the duration
of the stun effect increases by 1 round.

### Psionic Lion's Charge

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 2
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 swift action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Power Points:** 3

You gain the powerful charging ability of a lion. When you charge, you
can make a full attack in the same round.

You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to
gain the benefit of the power as you charge. Manifesting the power is a
swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward
the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest
this power when it isn't your turn.

**Augment:** For every additional power point you spend, each of your
attacks after a charge in the current round gains a circumstance bonus
on damage equal to the number of additional points spent.

### Psionic Lock

-   Psychoportation
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 2
-   **Display:** Material
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Door, chest, or portal touched, up to 30 sq. ft./level
    in size
-   **Duration:** Permanent
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** No
-   **Power Points:** 3

A *psionic lock* manifested upon a door, chest, or portal psionically
locks it. You can freely pass your own lock without affecting it;
otherwise, a door or object secured with *psionic lock* can be opened
only by breaking in or by a successful *dispel psionics* effect. Add +10
to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this power.

### Psionic Repair Damage

-   Metacreativity
-   **Level:** Shaper 2
-   **Display:** Material and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Construct touched
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **Power Points:** 3

When laying your hands upon a construct that has at least 1 hit point
remaining, you reknit its structure to repair damage it has taken. The
power repairs 3d8 points of damage +1 point per manifester level.
Constructs that are immune to psionics or magic cannot be repaired in
this fashion.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power
repairs an additional 1d8 points of damage.

### Psionic Revivify

-   Psychometabolism (Healing) \[Good\]
-   **Level:** Egoist 5
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Dead creature touched
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **Power Points:** 9, XP

*Psionic revivify* lets a manifester reconnect a corpse's psyche with
its body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The power must
be manifested within 1 round of the victim's death. Before the psyche of
the deceased has completely left the body, this power halts its journey
while repairing somewhat the damage to the body.

This power functions like the *raisedead* spell, except that the
affected creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no
loss of powers.

The creature has --1 hit points (but is stable) after being restored to
life.

*XP Cost:* 200 XP.

**Augment:** For every 100 additional experience points that both you
and the subject pay, the manifestation of this power can be delayed by 1
additional round.

### Psionic Scent

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Psychic warrior 2
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level
-   **Power Points:** 3

You gain an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of
some monsters. This ability allows you to detect approaching enemies,
sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. With the scent
ability, you can identify familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar
sights.

You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the
opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it
drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can
be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such
as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal
range.

When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not
revealed---only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move
action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within 5
feet of the source, you pinpoint the source's location.

If you have the Track feat, you can follow tracks by smell, making a
Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for
a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent).
This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor
is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour
that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise
follows the rules for the Track feat. If you are tracking with *psionic
scent,* you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor
visibility.

### Psychic Chirurgery

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Telepath 9
-   **Display:** Auditory, mental, and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 17, XP; see text

You can repair psychic damage or grant another creature knowledge of
powers you know, depending on the version of this power you manifest.

*Repair Psychic Damage:* You can remove any compulsions and charms
affecting the subject. In fact, you can remove any instantaneous or
permanent effect caused by a psychic power with *psychic chirurgery*.
Unlike with *aura alteration*, these effects end or are negated as soon
as this power is manifested, with no need for another saving throw.

You can remove all negative levels affecting the subject, regardless of
how it lost those levels, restoring it to the highest level it had
previously attained. Also, you can restore levels lost to energy drain
or a similar effect if the level drain occurred within a number of hours
equal to your manifester level.

You can also remove all psionic effects penalizing the subject's ability
scores, heal all ability damage, and remove any ability drain affecting
the subject. *Psychic chirurgery*negates all forms of insanity,
confusion, the effect of such powers as *microcosm,* and so on, but it
does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

*Transfer Knowledge:* If desired, you can use this power to directly
transfer knowledge of a power you know to another psionic character. You
can give a character knowledge of a power of any level that she can
manifest, even if the power is not normally on the character's power
list. Knowledge of powers gained through *psychic chirurgery* does not
count toward the maximum number of powers a character can know per
level.

*XP Cost:* Each time you use psychic chirurgery to implant knowledge of
a power in another creature, you pay an XP cost equal to 1,000 x the
level of the power implanted. If you and the subject are both willing to
do so, you can split this cost evenly.

### Psychic Crush

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 5
-   **Display:** Auditory
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. +5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will partial; see text
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 9

Your will abruptly and brutally crushes the mental essence of any one
creature, debilitating its acumen. The target must make a Will save with
a +4 bonus or collapse unconscious and dying at --1 hit points. If the
target succeeds on the save, it takes 3d6 points of damage.

**Augment:** For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
damage increases by 1d6 points.

### Psychic Reformation

-   Telepathy \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Psion/wilder 4
-   **Display:** Auditory, mental, and visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Power Resistance:** No
-   **Power Points:** 7, XP; see text

When this power is manifested, the subject can choose to spend its most
recently gained skill points differently (picking new skills and
abandoning old ones if it chooses) and to choose a different feat from
the one it selected when advancing from its previous level to its
current level.

The subject can also choose to forget powers it acquired when advancing
to its current level, replacing them with new ones.

The subject can undo decisions of these sorts that were made at lower
levels, if both the subject and the manifester agree to pay the
necessary XP before this power is manifested (see below). The subject
must abide by the standard rules for selecting skills and feats, and so
it cannot take feats for which it doesn't qualify or take crossclass
skills as class skills.

*XP Cost:* This power costs 50 XP to manifest to reformat choices made
when the character reached her current level. For each additional
previous level into which the revision reaches, the power costs an
additional 50 XP. The manifester and subject split all XP costs evenly.

### Psychic Vampire

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Egoist 4, psychic warrior 4
-   **Display:** Mental
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
-   **Power Resistance:** Yes
-   **Power Points:** 7

This power shrouds your hand or a natural weapon you possess with
darkness that you can use to drain an opponent's power.

If you manifest this power to affect your hand, the next successful
melee touch attack you make (if the victim fails its Fortitude save)
drains 2 power points from your foe for every manifester level you have.
The drained points simply dissipate. Your touch attack, charged with
psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.

If you manifest this power to affect a natural weapon you possess, you
must make a successful melee attack with the weapon to gain the power's
benefit.

Against a psionic being that has no power points or a nonpsionic foe,
your attack instead deals 2 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
damage (your choice).

### Psychofeedback

-   Psychometabolism
-   **Level:** Egoist 5, psychic warrior 5
-   **Display:** Visual
-   **Manifesting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
-   **Power Points:** 9

You can readjust your body to boost one physical ability score at the
expense of one or more other scores. Select one ability score you would
like to boost, and increase it by the same amount that you decrease one
or more other scores. All score decreases are treated as a special form
of ability damage, called ability burn, which cannot be magically or
psionically healed---it goes away only through natural healing.

You can boost your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score by an
amount equal to your manifester level (or any lesser amount), assuming
you can afford to burn your other ability scores to such an extent.

When the duration of this power expires, your ability boost also ends,
but your ability burn remains until it is healed naturally.
