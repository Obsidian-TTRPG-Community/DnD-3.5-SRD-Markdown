: Table: The Paladin

### Class Features {#paladin--class-features}

All of the following are class features of the paladin.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Paladins are proficient with all
simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and
light), and with shields (except tower shields).

**Aura of Good (Ex):** The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the
*detect good* spell) is equal to her paladin level.

***Detect Evil* (Sp):** At will, a paladin can use *detect evil*, as the
spell.

**Smite Evil (Su):** Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil
with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to
her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If
the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite
has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.

At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite
evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to
a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.

**Divine Grace (Su):** At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to
her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.

**Lay on Hands (Su):** Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma
score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by
touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage
equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to
divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to
use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.

Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to
deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires
a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of
opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of
points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.

**Aura of Courage (Su):** Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to
fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4
morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is
unconscious or dead.

**Divine Health (Ex):** At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all
diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.

**Turn Undead (Su):**When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the
supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number
of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as
a cleric of three levels lower would.

**Spells:** Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast
a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell
list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Wisdom
modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is
given on Table: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per
day if she has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Paladin indicates
that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains
only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score
for that spell level The paladin does not have access to any domain
spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.

A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she
cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a *cure* spell in its
place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell
list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must
choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and
higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.

***Special Mount* (Sp):** Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the
service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve
her in her crusade against evil (see below). This mount is usually a
heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small
paladin).

Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her
mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the
equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level.
The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2
hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free
action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though
the paladin may release a particular mount from service.

Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of
any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing
or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount
is a conjuration (calling) effect.

Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving
behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another
mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever
comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During
this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a --1 penalty on attack and
weapon damage rolls.

***Remove Disease* (Sp):** At 6th level, a paladin can produce a *remove
disease* effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability
one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per
week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).

**Code of Conduct:** A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and
loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act.

Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate
authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison,
and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for
evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.

**Associates:** While she may adventure with characters of any good or
neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil
characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who
consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen,
followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.

### Ex-Paladins

A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil
act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin
spells and abilities (including the service of the paladin's mount, but
not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She may not progress any
farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and
advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the
*atonement* spell description), as appropriate.

Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass
character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction. A paladin
who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise
her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin abilities.

### The Paladin's Mount

The paladin's mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has
special powers, as described below. The standard mount for a Medium
paladin is a heavy warhorse, and the standard mount for a Small paladin
is a warpony. Another kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a
halfling paladin) or a Large shark (for a paladin in an aquatic
campaign) may be allowed as well.

A paladin's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the
purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an
animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).

  --------------- ---------- -------------------- ---------- ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Paladin Level   Bonus HD   Natural Armor Adj.   Str Adj.   Int   Special
  5th--7th        +2         +4                   +1         6     Empathic link, improved evasion, share spells, share saving throws
  8th--10th       +4         +6                   +2         7     Improved speed
  11th--14th      +6         +8                   +3         8     *Command* creatures of its kind
  15th--20th      +8         +10                  +4         9     Spell resistance
  --------------- ---------- -------------------- ---------- ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------

**Paladin's Mount Basics:** Use the base statistics for a creature of
the mount's kind,but make changes to take into account the attributes
and characteristics summarized on the table and described below.

*Bonus HD:* Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a
Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount's
base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount's base attack bonus
is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount's HD. A mount
has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level
equals the animal's HD). The mount gains additional skill points or
feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.

*Natural Armor Adj.:* The number on the table is an improvement to the
mount's existing natural armor bonus.

*Str Adj.:* Add this figure to the mount's Strength score.

*Int:* The mount's Intelligence score.

*Empathic Link (Su):* The paladin has an empathic link with her mount
out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the
mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.

Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans,
so misunderstandings are always possible.

Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an
item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his
familiar (see Familiars).

*Improved Evasion (Ex):* When subjected to an attack that normally
allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if
it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw
fails.

*Share Spells:* At the paladin's option, she may have any spell (but not
any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount.

The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the
benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous,
it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and
will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before
the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a
target of "You" on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on
herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells
normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast).

*Share Saving Throws:* For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its
own base save bonus or the paladin's, whichever is higher. The mount
applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any
other bonuses on saves that the master might have.

*Improved Speed (Ex):* The mount's speed increases by 10 feet.

*Command (Sp):* Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a
mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of
approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this
category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target
creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like
the *command* spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check
to succeed if it's being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the
ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's
daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's
level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect.

*Spell Resistance (Ex):* A mount's spell resistance equals its master's
paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must
get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals
or exceeds the mount's spell resistance.

### Class Features {#ranger--class-features}

All of the following are class features of the ranger.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A ranger is proficient with all simple
and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower
shields).

**Favored Enemy (Ex):** At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of
creature from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The
ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and
Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type.
Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such
creatures.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th
level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those
given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus
against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so
desired) increases by 2.

If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must
also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a
specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy,
the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is
higher.

  ---------------------- ----------------------
  Type (Subtype)         Type (Subtype)
  Aberration             Humanoid (reptilian)
  Animal                 Magical beast
  Construct              Monstrous humanoid
  Dragon                 Ooze
  Elemental              Outsider (air)
  Fey                    Outsider (chaotic)
  Giant                  Outsider (earth)
  Humanoid (aquatic)     Outsider (evil)
  Humanoid (dwarf)       Outsider (fire)
  Humanoid (elf)         Outsider (good)
  Humanoid (goblinoid)   Outsider (lawful)
  Humanoid (gnoll)       Outsider (native)
  Humanoid (gnome)       Outsider (water)
  Humanoid (halfling)    Plant
  Humanoid (human)       Undead
  Humanoid (orc)         Vermin

  : Table: Ranger Favored Enemies

**Track:** A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat.

**Wild Empathy (Ex):** A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal.
This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the
attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level
and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The
typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while
wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study
each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another
under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in
this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take
more or less time.

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with
an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a --4 penalty on the
check.

**Combat Style (Ex):** At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two
combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice
affects the character's class features but does not restrict his
selection of feats or special abilities in any way.

If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot
feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the
Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal
prerequisites for that feat.

The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light
or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing
medium or heavy armor.

**Endurance:** A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

**Animal Companion (Ex):** At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal
companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat,
dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake
(Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or
partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added
to the ranger's list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and
squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on
his adventures as appropriate for its kind.

This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except
that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A
ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just
as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his
ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal
if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.

**Spells:** Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a
small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell
list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see
below).

To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom
modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is
given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per
day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that
the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only
the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for
that spell level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells
or granted powers, as a cleric does.

A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he
cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a *cure* spell in its place. A
ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided
that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells
to prepare during his daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and
higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.

**Improved Combat Style (Ex):** At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his
chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he
selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot
feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as
having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have
the normal prerequisites for that feat.

As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he
wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when
wearing medium or heavy armor.

**Woodland Stride (Ex):** Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move
through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without
taking damage or suffering any other impairment.

However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or
magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.

**Swift Tracker (Ex):** Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his
normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal --5
penalty. He takes only a --10 penalty (instead of the normal --20) when
moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

**Evasion (Ex):** At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and
unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex
saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a
successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if
the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does
not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Combat Style Mastery (Ex):** At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his
chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he
selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved
Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for
that feat.

If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as
having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have
the normal prerequisites for that feat.

As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he
wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when
wearing medium or heavy armor.

**Camouflage (Ex):** A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide
skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant
cover or concealment.

**Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):** While in any sort of natural terrain, a
ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being
observed.

  : Table: The Rogue

### Class Features {#rogue--class-features}

All of the following are class features of the rogue.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Rogues are proficient with all simple
weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword.
Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

**Sneak Attack:** If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to
defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot
for extra damage.

The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be
denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a
Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra
damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue
levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak
attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within
30 feet.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak
attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot
use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a
sneak attack, not even with the usual --4 penalty.

A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible
anatomies---undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures
lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits
is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the
target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach
such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with
concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond
reach.

**Trapfinding:** Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to
locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20.

Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is
well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the
spell used to create it.

Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm
magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the
spell used to create it.

A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check
can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her
party) without disarming it.

**Evasion (Ex):** At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even
magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a
successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals
half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion
can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A
helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Trap Sense (Ex):** At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that
alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves
made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by
traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3
when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at
15th, and to +6 at 18th level.

Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to
danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains
her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or
struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity
bonus to AC if immobilized.

If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she
automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** A rogue of 8th level or higher can no
longer be flanked.

This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the
character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more
rogue levels than the target does.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second
class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead,
and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to
determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

**Special Abilities:** On attaining 10th level, and at every three
levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special
ability of her choice from among the following options.

*Crippling Strike (Ex):* A rogue with this ability can sneak attack
opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An
opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of
Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at
the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.

*Defensive Roll (Ex):* The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow
to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when
she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from
a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can
attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must
attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds,
she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full
damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order
to execute her defensive roll---if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to
AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally
allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's
evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.

*Improved Evasion (Ex):* This ability works like evasion, except that
while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving
throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage
on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved
evasion.

*Opportunist (Ex):* Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of
opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in
melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of
opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat
can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.

*Skill Mastery:* The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain
skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.

Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 +
her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these
skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally
prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability
multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each
time.

*Slippery Mind (Ex):* This ability represents the rogue's ability to
wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel
her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell
or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round
later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on
her saving throw.

*Feat:* A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.

## Sorcerer

**Hit Die:** d4.

  : Table: Sorcerer Spells Known

### Class Features {#sorcerer--class-features}

All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Sorcerers are proficient with all
simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or
shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which
can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells:** A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily
from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows
without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must
(see below).

To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's
Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is
given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per
day if he has a high Charisma score.

A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins
play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your
choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as
indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the
number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score;
the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells
can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they
can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of
by study. The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to
learn spells at a faster rate, however.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after
that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell
in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer "loses" the
old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the
same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two
levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can
cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and
must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he
gains new spells known for the level.

Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in
advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not
yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to
decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.

**Familiar:** A sorcerer can obtain a familiar (see below). Doing so
takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A
familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is
unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and
servant.

The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer
advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.

If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must
attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200
experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to
one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can
never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A
slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A
slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be,
and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy
event occurs.

A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have
only one familiar at a time.

## Wizard

**Alignment:** Any.

**Hit Die:** d4.

### Class Skills {#wizard--class-skills}

The wizard's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are
Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge (all
skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft
(Int). See Chapter 4: Skills for skill descriptions.

**Skill Points at 1st Level:** (2 + Int modifier) x4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level:** 2 + Int modifier.

: Table: The Wizard

### Class Features {#wizard--class-features}

All of the following are class features of the wizard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Wizards are proficient with the club,
dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with
any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a
wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components
to fail.

**Spells:** A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the
sorcerer/ wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells
ahead of time (see below).

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence
score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a
saving throw against a wizard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the
wizard's Intelligence modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is
given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per
day if she has a high Intelligence score.

Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She
must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good
night's sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While
studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.

**Bonus Languages:** A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the
bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

**Familiar:** A wizard can obtain a familiar in exactly the same manner
as a sorcerer can. See the sorcerer description and the information on
Familiars below for details.

**Scribe Scroll:** At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus
feat.

**Bonus Feats:** At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a
bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat,
an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all
prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any
class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the
categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery
when choosing these feats.

**Spellbooks:** A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare
her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook,
except for *read magic*, which all wizards can prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard
spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see
School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your
choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the
spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each
new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels
that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At
any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards'
spellbooks to her own.

### School Specialization

A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common
theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see
below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her
chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other
schools.

A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty
school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft
checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.

The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose
her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two
other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination;
see below), which become her prohibited schools.

A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement.

Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the
wizard, and she can't even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them
from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her
prohibited schools later.

The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration,
divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and
transmutation.

Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal
spells.

*Abjuration:* Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration
specialist is called an abjurer.

*Conjuration:* Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A
conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.

*Divination:* Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is
called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up
only one other school.

*Enchantment:* Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or
grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is
called an enchanter.

*Evocation:* Spells that manipulate energy or create something from
nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.

*Illusion:* Spells that alter perception or create false images. An
illusion specialist is called an illusionist.

*Necromancy:* Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life
force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.

*Transmutation:* Spells that transform the recipient physically or
change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist
is called a transmuter.

*Universal:* Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards
can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as
a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this
category.

### Familiars

A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a
magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It
retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses,
skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as
a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that
depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a
familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.

A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or
wizard), as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only
when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the
purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the
master's level.

  ^2^ Tiny viper.                                                                                 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------

**Familiar Basics:** Use the basic statistics for a creature of the
familiar's kind, but make the following changes:

*Hit Dice:* For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice,
use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total,
whichever is higher.

*Hit Points:* The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points
(not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its
actual Hit Dice.

*Attacks:* Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all
his classes. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier,
whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with
natural weapons.

Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.

*Saving Throws:* For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base
save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master's (as
calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses
its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the
other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

*Skills:* For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has
ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or
the master's skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the
familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's
total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's
ability to use.

**Familiar Ability Descriptions:** All familiars have special abilities
(or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master's
combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table
below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.

*Natural Armor Adj.:* The number noted here is an improvement to the
familiar's existing natural armor bonus.

*Int:* The familiar's Intelligence score.

*Alertness (Ex):* While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master
gains the Alertness feat.

*Improved Evasion (Ex):* When subjected to an attack that normally
allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage
if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving
throw fails.

*Share Spells:* At the master's option, he may have any spell (but not
any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar.
The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the
benefit.

If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops
affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not
affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the
duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a
target of "You" on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on
himself.

A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally
do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).

*Empathic Link (Su):* The master has an empathic link with his familiar
out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the
familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the
limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be
communicated.

Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an
item or place that his familiar does.

*Deliver Touch Spells (Su):* If the master is 3rd level or higher, a
familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the
familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he
can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then
deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the
master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch
spell dissipates.

*Speak with Master (Ex):* If the master is 5th level or higher, a
familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a
common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication
without magical help.

*Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):* If the master is 7th level or
higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the
same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats
with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds,
lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with
similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks,
wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the
intelligence of the conversing creatures.

*Spell Resistance (Ex):* If the master is 11th level or higher, a
familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To
affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result
on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the
familiar's spell resistance.

*Scry on Familiar (Sp):* If the master is 13th level or higher, he may
scry on his familiar (as if casting the *scrying* spell) once per day.

### Arcane Spells and Armor

Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.

If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they'll be clumsy in it),
or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various
Armor Proficiency feats---light, medium, and heavy---and the Shield
Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants
them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor
with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere
with spellcasting.

Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must
make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The
armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for
different armors and shields.

By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively,
but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor.
A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield
incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes
proficient with that armor.

If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can
cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be
cast even if the caster's hands are bound or if he or she is grappling
(although Concentration checks still apply normally). Also, the
metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a
spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic
component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor
without risking arcane spell failure.

## Multiclass Characters

A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in level, thus
becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from a character's
different classes combine to determine a multiclass character's overall
abilities. Multiclassing improves a character's versatility at the
expense of focus.

### Class and Level Features

As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum
of the abilities of each of the character's classes.

**Level:** "Character level" is a character's total number of levels. It
is used to determine when feats and ability score boosts are gained.

"Class level" is a character's level in a particular class. For a
character whose levels are all in the same class, character level and
class level are the same.

**Hit Points:** A character gains hit points from each class as his or
her class level increases, adding the new hit points to the previous
total.

**Base Attack Bonus:** Add the base attack bonuses acquired for each
class to get the character's base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6
or higher provides the character with multiple attacks.

**Saving Throws:** Add the base save bonuses for each class together.

**Skills:** If a skill is a class skill for any of a multiclass
character's classes, then character level determines a skill's maximum
rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.)

If a skill is not a class skill for any of a multiclass character's
classes, the maximum rank for that skill is one-half the maximum for a
class skill.

**Class Features:** A multiclass character gets all the class features
of all his or her classes but must also suffer the consequences of the
special restrictions of all his or her classes. (*Exception:* A
character who acquires the barbarian class does not become illiterate.)

In the special case of turning undead, both clerics and experienced
paladins have the same ability. If the character's paladin level is 4th
or higher, her effective turning level is her cleric level plus her
paladin level minus 3.

In the special case of uncanny dodge, both experienced barbarians and
experienced rogues have the same ability. When a barbarian/rogue would
gain uncanny dodge a second time (for her second class), she instead
gains improved uncanny dodge, if she does not already have it. Her
barbarian and rogue levels stack to determine the rogue level an
attacker needs to flank her.

In the special case of obtaining a familiar, both wizards and sorcerers
have the same ability. A sorcerer/wizard stacks his sorcerer and wizard
levels to determine the familiar's natural armor, Intelligence score,
and special abilities.

**Feats:** A multiclass character gains feats based on character levels,
regardless of individual class level

**Ability Increases:** A multiclass character gains ability score
increases based on character level, regardless of individual class
level.

**Spells:** The character gains spells from all of his or her
spellcasting classes and keeps a separate spell list for each class. If
a spell's effect is based on the class level of the caster, the player
must keep track of which class's spell list the character is casting the
spell from.
