## Favored Class

A character's favored class doesn't count against him or her when
determining experience point penalties for multiclassing.

## Race and Languages

All characters know how to speak Common. A dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf,
half-orc, or halfling also speaks a racial language, as appropriate. A
character who has an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other
languages as well, one extra language per point of Intelligence bonus as
a starting character.

Literacy: Any character except a barbarian can read and write all the
languages he or she speaks.

Class-Related Languages: Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain
languages as bonus languages even if they're not on the lists found in
the race descriptions. These class-related languages are as follows:

*Cleric:* Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.

*Druid:* Sylvan.

*Wizard:* Draconic.

## Small Characters

A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus
on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. A Small character's
carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.

A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium
character.

A Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium character.

## Humans

-   Medium: As Medium creatures, humans have no special bonuses or
    penalties due to their size.
-   Human base land speed is 30 feet.
-   1 extra feat at 1st level.
-   4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at each
    additional level.
-   Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret
    languages, such as Druidic). See the Speak Language skill.
-   Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass human
    takes an experience point penalty, his or her highest-level class
    does not count.

## Dwarves

-   +2 Constitution, --2 Charisma.
-   Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or
    penalties due to their size.
-   Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this
    speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a
    medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced
    in such situations).
-   Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is
    black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and
    dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.
-   Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on
    Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls,
    stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the
    old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like.
    Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also
    counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet
    of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively
    searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework
    traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his
    approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense
    which way is up.
-   Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven
    urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.
-   Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist
    being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not
    when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on
    the ground).
-   +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.
-   +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like
    effects.
-   +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids.
-   +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type.
    Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor
    Class, such as when it's caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge
    bonus, too.
-   +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or
    metal items.
-   +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.
-   Automatic Languages: Common and Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Giant,
    Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon.
-   Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass dwarf 's fighter class does not
    count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty
    for multiclassing

## Elves

-   +2 Dexterity, --2 Constitution.
-   Medium: As Medium creatures, elves have no special bonuses or
    penalties due to their size.
-   Elf base land speed is 30 feet.

    against enchantment spells or effects.
-   Low-Light Vision: An elf can see twice as far as a human in
    starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor
    illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and
    detail under these conditions.
-   Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency
    feats for the longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite
    longbow), and shortbow (including composite shortbow) as bonus
    feats.
-   +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who
    merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is
    entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively
    looking for it.
-   Automatic Languages: Common and Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
    Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.
-   Favored Class: Wizard. A multiclass elf 's wizard class does not
    count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty
    for multiclassing.

## Gnomes

-   +2 Constitution, --2 Strength.
-   Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor
    Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide
    checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting
    and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium
    character.
-   Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.
-   Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in
    starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor
    illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail
    under these conditions.

    weapons rather than exotic weapons.

    illusion spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those
    from similar effects.

-   +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type.
    Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor

    bonus, too.
-   +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.
-   +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks.
-   Automatic Languages: Common and Gnome. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
    Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, and Orc. In addition, a gnome can
    speak with a burrowing mammal (a badger, fox, rabbit, or the like,
    see below). This ability is innate to gnomes. See the *speak with
    animals* spell description.
-   Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day---*speak with animals* (burrowing mammal
    only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of at least
    10 also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day---*dancing
    lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation.* Caster level 1st; save DC
    10 + gnome's Cha modifier + spell level.
-   Favored Class: Bard. A multiclass gnome's bard class does not count
    when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.

    penalties due to their size.

    racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.

    count.

    penalties due to their size.

    an orc.

-   Automatic Languages: Common and Orc. Bonus Languages: Draconic,
    Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Abyssal.
