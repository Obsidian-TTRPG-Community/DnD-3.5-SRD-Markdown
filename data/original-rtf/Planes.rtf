The Material Plane tends to be the most Earthlike of all planes and operates under the same set of natural laws that our own real world does. This is the default plane for most adventures.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Transitive Planes:}{\fs20\cf0  These three planes have one important common 
characteristic: Each is used to get from one place to another. The Astral Plane is a conduit to all other planes, while the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow both serve as means of transportation within the Material Plane they\rquote 
re connected to. These planes have the strongest regular interaction with the Material Plane and are often accessed by using various spells. They have native inhabitants as well.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Inner Planes:}{\fs20\cf0  These six planes are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the universe. Each 
is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy or element as the plane itself.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Outer Planes:}{\fs20\cf0  The deities live on the Outer Planes, as do creatures such as cel
estials, demons, and devils. Each of the Outer Planes has an alignment, representing a particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave in agreement with that plane\rquote 
s alignment. The Outer Planes are also the final resting place of souls from the Material Plane, whether that final rest takes the form of calm introspection or eternal damnation.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Demiplanes:}{\fs20\cf0  This catch-all category covers all extradimensional spaces that function like planes but have measurable size and limited 
access. Other kinds of planes are theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across.

\par }{\cf0 PLANAR TRAITS
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Each plane of existence has its own properties\emdash the natural laws of its universe.
\par Planar traits are broken down into a number of general areas.
\par 
\par All planes have the following kinds of traits.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Physical Traits:}{\fs20\cf0  These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time function.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Elemental and Energy Traits:}{\fs20\cf0  These traits determine the dominance of particular elemental or energy forces.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Alignment Traits:}{\fs20\cf0  Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many planes are tied to a particular moral or ethical outlook.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Magic Traits:}{\fs20\cf0  Magic works differently from plane to plane, and magic traits set the boundaries for what it can and can\rquote t do.

The two most important natural laws set by physical traits are how gravity works and how time passes. Other physical traits pertain to the size and shape of a plane and how easily a plane\rquote s nature can be altered.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 
\par Gravity:}{\fs20\cf0  The direction of gravity\rquote s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the plane itself.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Normal Gravity: }{\fs20\cf0 Most planes have gravity similar to that of the Material Plane. The usual rules fo
r ability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise noted in a description, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Heavy Gravity: }{\fs20\cf0 The gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, Balance, Climb, Jump, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks incur a \endash 
2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a character\rquote s speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character\rquote s Strength
 and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Light Gravity: }{\fs20\cf0 The gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on t
he Material Plane. As a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their movements tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the light gravity trait take a \endash 
2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb and Jump checks.
\par Strength and Dexterity don\rquote t change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other planes as well as natives.
\par Falling characters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4).
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 No Gravity: }{\fs20\cf0 Individuals on a plane with this trait merely float in space, unless other resources are available to provide a direction for gravity\rquote s pull.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Objective Directional Gravity: }{\fs20\cf0 The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but the direction is not the traditional \'93down\'94 toward the ground. I
t may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of the plane itself, or even upward.
\par In addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The direction of \'93down\'94 may vary.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Subjective Directional Gravity: }{\fs20\cf0 The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of gravity\rquote 
s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on \'93weightless\'94 planes.
\par Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining \'93down\'94 near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character \'93flies\'94 by merely choosing a \'93down\'94 direction and \'93falling\'94
 that way. Under such a procedure, an individual \'93falls\'94 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in each succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one\rquote s movement by changing the designated \'93down
\'94 direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet per round thereafter).
\par It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or she succeeds.

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 
\par Time:}{\fs20\cf0  The rate of time\rquote s passage can vary on different planes, though it remains constant within any particular plane. Time is a
lways subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various planes. Travelers may discover that they\rquote ll pick up or lose time while moving among the planes, but from their point of view, time always passes naturally.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Normal Time: }{\fs20\cf0 This trait de
scribes the way time passes on the Material Plane. One hour on a plane with normal time equals one hour on the Material Plane. Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the normal time trait.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Timeless: }{\fs20\cf0 On planes with this trait, time still p
asses, but the effects of time are diminished. How the timeless trait can affect certain activities or conditions such as hunger, thirst, aging, the effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane.
\par The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally, conditions such as hunger and aging do occur retroactively. 
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Flowing Time: }{\fs20\cf0 On some planes, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, then return to the Materi
al Plane to find that only six seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds older. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working on him, that year away was entirely real.
\par When designating how time works on planes with flowing time, put the Material Plane\rquote s flow of time first, followed by the same flow in the other plane. 
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Erratic Time: }{\fs20\cf0 Some planes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he moves between the two planes. The following is provided as an example.

\fs20\cf0 To the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed.
\par If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a noninstantaneous duration is permanent until dispelled.

\par Shape and Size:}{\fs20\cf0  Planes come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most planes are infinite, or at least so large that they may as well be infinite.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Infinite: }{\fs20\cf0 Planes with this trait go on forever, though they may have finite components within them. Or they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map that stretches out infinitely.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Finite Shape: }{\fs20\cf0 A plane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin other planes or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great wall. Demiplanes are often finite.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Self-Contained Shape: }{\fs20\cf0 On planes with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositi
ng the traveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a self-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat planes with magical edges that teleport the traveler to an opposite edge when he crosses them. 

\par Some demiplanes are self-contained.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 
\par Morphic Traits:}{\fs20\cf0  This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some planes are responsive to sentient thought, while others can be manipulated only by extremely powerful creatures. And some planes
 respond to physical or magical efforts.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Alterable Morphic: }{\fs20\cf0 On a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are) unless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the immediate environment as a result of tangible effort. 
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Highly Morphic: }{\fs20\cf0 On a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it\rquote 
s difficult to keep a particular area stable. Such planes may react dramatically to specific spells, sentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for no reason. 
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Magically Morphic: }{\fs20\cf0 Specific spells can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Divinely Morphic: }{\fs20\cf0 Specific unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter objects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with 
this trait. Ordinary characters find these planes similar to alterable planes in that they may be affected by spells and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas to change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves. 

\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Static: }{\fs20\cf0 These planes are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane, nor objects that the denizens possess. Any spells that would affect those on the plane have no effect unless the plane\rquote 
s static trait is somehow removed or suppressed. Spells cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain in effect, however.
\par Even moving an unattended object within a static plane requires a DC 16 Strength check. Particularly heavy objects may be impossible to move.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Sentient: }{\fs20\cf0 These planes are ones that respond to a single thought\emdash  that of the plane itself. Travelers would find the plane\rquote 
s landscape changing as a result of what the plane thought of the travelers, either becoming more or less hospitable depending on its reaction.

 Mostly open space, planes with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Creatures 
of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant planes because they have little or no natural earth to connect with. They take no actual damage, however.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Earth-Dominant:}{\fs20\cf0  Planes with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive run the risk of suffocation if they don\rquote

ominant planes because these planes are tight and claustrophobic to them. But they suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Fire-Dominant: }{\fs20\cf0 
Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to Material Plane creatures, and those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.

\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Positive-Dominant: }{\fs20\cf0 An abundance of life characterizes planes with this trait. The two kinds of p
ositive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense as 
a result of the positive energy swirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2 as an extraordinary ability.
\par Major positive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make
 a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane grants fast healing 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full hit points gain 5 additional temporary hit points p
e
r round. These temporary hit points fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive- dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round that its temporary hit points exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the
 saving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, killing it.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Negative-Dominant:}{\fs20\cf0  Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color a
nd filled with winds bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant planes, negative-dominant planes can be either minor or major. On minor negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of damage per round. At
 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into ash.
\par Major negative-dominant planes are even more severe. Each round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or Hit Dice is slain, becoming a wraith. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 
death ward }{\fs20\cf0 spell protects a traveler from the damage and energy drain of a negative-dominant plane.

\par }{\cf0 HOW PLANES INTERACT
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Separate Planes:}{\fs20\cf0  Two planes that are separate do not overlap or directly connect to each other. They are like planets in different orbits. The only way to get from one separate plane to the other is to go through a third plane.

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Coterminous Planes:}{\fs20\cf0  Planes that touch at specific points are coterminous. Where they touch, a connection exists, and travelers can leave one reality behind and enter the other.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Coexistent Planes:}{\fs20\cf0 
 If a link between two planes can be created at any point, the two planes are coexistent. These planes overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can be reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps. When mov
ing on a coexistent plane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the plane it coexists with. 
\par 
\par Layered Planes
\par Infinities may be broken into smaller infinities, and planes into smaller, related planes. These laye
rs are effectively separate planes of existence, and each layer can have its own planar traits. Layers are connected to each other through a variety of planar gates, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.
\par Access to a layered plane from elsewhere us
ually happens on a specific layer: the first layer of the plane, which can be either the top layer or the bottom layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access points (such as portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the g
ateway for other layers of the plane. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 plane shift }{\fs20\cf0 spell also deposits the spellcaster on the first layer of the plane.

\par PLANE DESCRIPTIONS
\par }{\cf0 
\par THE MATERIAL PLANE
\par }{\fs20\cf0 The Material Plane is the center of most cosmologies and defines what is considered normal.
\par The Material Plane has the following traits:
\par \bullet  Normal gravity.
\par \bullet  Normal Time
\par \bullet  Alterable morphic.
\par \bullet  No Elemental or Energy Traits (specific locations may have these traits, however)
\par \bullet  Mildly neutral-aligned.
\par \bullet  Normal magic. 
\par }{\fs18\cf0 
\par }{\cf0 THE ETHEREAL PLANE
\par }{\fs20\cf0 The Etherea
l Plane is coexistent with the Material Plane and often other planes as well. The Material Plane itself is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy.

ssible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane, the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa. A traveler on t

The Ethereal Plane is mostly empty of structures and impediments. However, the plane has its own inhabitants. Some of these are other ethereal travelers, but the ghosts found here pose a particular peril to those who walk the fog. 
\par It has the following traits.
\par \bullet  No gravity.
\par \bullet  Alterable morphic. The plane contains little to alter, however.
\par \bullet  Mildly neutral-aligned.
\par \bullet  Normal magic. Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do not cross into the Material Plane. 
\par The only exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that have the force descriptor and abjuration spells that affect ethereal beings. Spellcasters on the Material Plane must have some 
way to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane before targeting them with force-based spells, of course. While it\rquote s possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force spell cast on the Material Plane, the reverse isn\rquote 
t possible. No magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane, including force attacks.
\par }{\cf0 
\par PLANE OF SHADOW
\par }{\fs18\cf0 The Plane of Shadow is a dimly lit dimension that is both coterminous to and coexistent with the Material Plane. It overlaps the Material }{\fs20\cf0 Plane much as the Ethereal Plane does, so 
a planar traveler can use the Plane of Shadow to cover great distances quickly.
\par The Plane of Shadow is also coterminous to other planes. With the right spell, a character can use the Plane of Shadow to visit other realities.
\par The Plane of Shadow is a world of black and white; color itself has been bleached from the environment. It is otherwise appears similar to the Material Plane.
\par Despite the lack of light sources, various plants, animals, and humanoids call the Plane of Shadow home.
\par The Plane of Shadow is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto other planes. As a result, creating a precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks.
\par The Plane of Shadow has the following traits.
\par \bullet  Magically morphic. Certain spells modify the base material of the Plane of Shadow. The utility and power of these spells within the Plane of Shadow make them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.
\par \bullet  Mildly neutral-aligned.
\par \bullet  Enhanced magic. Spells with the shadow descriptor are enhanced on the Plane of Shadow. Such spells are cast as though they were prepared with the Maximize Spell feat, though they don\rquote t require the higher spell slots.
\par Furthermore, specific spells become more powerful on the Plane of Shadow. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Shadow conjuration }{\fs20\cf0 and }{\i\fs20\cf0 shadow evocation }{\fs20\cf0 
spells are 30% as powerful as the conjurations and evocations they mimic (as opposed to 20%). }{\i\fs20\cf0 Greater shadow conjuration }{\fs20\cf0 and }{\i\fs20\cf0 greater shadow evocation }{\fs20\cf0 are 70% as powerful (not 60%), and a }{\i\fs20\cf0 
shades }{\fs20\cf0 spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original (not 80%).
\par \bullet  Impeded magic. Spells that use or generate light or fire may fizzle when cast on the Plane of Shadow. A spellcaster attempting a spell with the light or fire descriptor must succeed on a Spellcraft che
ck (DC 20 + the level of the spell). Spells that produce light are less effective in general, because all light sources have their ranges halved on the Plane of Shadow.
\par Despite the dark nature of the Plane of Shadow, spells that produce, use, or manipulate darkness are unaffected by the plane.
\par }{\cf0 
\par THE ASTRAL PLANE
\par }{\fs20\cf0 The Astral Plane is the space between the planes. When a character moves through an interplanar portal or projects her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through the Astral Plane. 
Even spells that allow instantaneous movement across a plane}{\i\fs20\cf0  }{\fs20\cf0 briefly touch the Astral Plane.
\par The Astral Plane is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.
