\par A magical arrow of acid springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack
 to hit your target. The arrow deals 2d4 points of acid damage with no splash damage. For every three caster levels (to a maximum of 18th), the acid, unless somehow neutralized, lasts for another round, dealing another 2d4 points of damage in that round.

\par }{\cf0 Air Walk
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Transmutation [Air]
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Air 4, Clr 4, Drd 4
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Components:}{\fs20\cf0  V, S, DF

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Touch
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Target:}{\fs20\cf0  Creature (Gargantuan or smaller) touched
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  10 min./level
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw:}{\fs20\cf0  None
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes (harmless)
\par The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker\rquote s normal speed.
\par A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally stron
g or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.
\par Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds
. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the }{
\i\fs20\cf0 air walk }{\fs20\cf0 spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an }{\i\fs20\cf0 antimagic field}{\fs20\cf0 .
\par You can cast }{\i\fs20\cf0 air walk }{\fs20\cf0 on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of }{\i\fs20\cf0 air walk }{\fs20\cf0 (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal ski
ll) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

\par A}{\i\fs20\cf0 larm }{\fs20\cf0 sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the }{
\i\fs20\cf0 alarm}{\fs20\cf0 . You decide at the time of casting whether the }{\i\fs20\cf0 alarm }{\fs20\cf0 will be mental or audible.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Mental Alarm: }{\fs20\cf0 A mental }{\i\fs20\cf0 alarm }{\fs20\cf0 alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental \'93ping\'94
 that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 silence }{\fs20\cf0 spell has no effect on a mental }{\i\fs20\cf0 alarm}{\fs20\cf0 .
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Audible Alarm: }{\fs20\cf0 An audible }{\i\fs20\cf0 alarm }{\fs20\cf0 produces the sound of a han
d bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.
\par In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a }{\i\fs20\cf0 silence }{\fs20\cf0 spell cannot hear the ringing.
\par Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the }{\i\fs20\cf0 alarm}{\fs20\cf0 .
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Alarm }{\fs20\cf0 can be made permanent with a }{\i\fs20\cf0 permanency }{\fs20\cf0 spell.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Arcane Focus:}{\fs20\cf0  A tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw: }{\fs20\cf0 Will negates (harmless, object)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes (harmless, object)
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Align weapon }{\fs20\cf0 makes a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment.
\par You can\rquote t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike.
\par When you make a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, }{\i\fs20\cf0 align weapon }{\fs20\cf0 is a good, evil, lawful, or chaotic spell, respectively.

\par You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. The new fo
rm must be within one size category of your normal size. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.
\par You retain your own ability sc
ores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the 
new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).
\par You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels.
\par If the
 new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs c
apable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
\par You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking
, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualit
ies (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
\par You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
\par You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of t
he new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn\rquote t change the creature type or subtype.
\par You can freely designate the new form\rquote s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form\rquote 
s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form\rquote s kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form\rquote 
s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
\par When the change occurs, your equipment,
 if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in th
e same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can\rquote 
t wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part
 common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form.

\par You discern all spells and magical propert

charges are left (if it uses charges). In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.
\par An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. I
f the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other }{\i\fs20\cf0 analyze dweomer }{\fs20\cf0 spells for 24 hours.

\par A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight. This alteration changes each animal\rquote 
s size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a \endash 2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature\rquote 
s existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal\rquote s modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage. The animal\rquote s space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not change.

\par The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Stren
gth check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it\emdash  the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.
\par All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.
\par Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature\rquote s possession instantly returns to its normal size.
\par The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
\par Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

\par You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a me
ssage to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.
\par Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your
 bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can\rquote 
t find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
\par During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it\rquote 
s written in a language he or she doesn\rquote t know, for example).

 and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.
\par The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it\emdash it does not snake outward\emdash 
so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1- inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst 
it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check t
o cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.
\par The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.

\par An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-li

\par An }{\i\fs20\cf0 antimagic field }{\fs20\cf0 suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an }{\i\fs20\cf0 antimagic field }{\fs20\cf0

\par Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an }{\i\fs20\cf0 antimagic field. }{\fs20\cf0 They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent 
winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast }{\i\fs20\cf0 antimagic field }{\fs20\cf0 
in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature\rquote s spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations}{\i\fs20\cf0  }{
\fs20\cf0 are not affected by an }{\i\fs20\cf0 antimagic field }{\fs20\cf0 because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)
\par A normal creature can enter the area, as
 can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creati
on process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures\rquote 
 spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Dispel magic }{\fs20\cf0 does not remove the field.
\par Two or more }{\i\fs20\cf0 antimagic fields }{\fs20\cf0 sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of force, prismatic sphere}{\fs20\cf0 , and }{\i\fs20\cf0 prismatic wall, }{\fs20\cf0

\par By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether.
\par You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you 
at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
\par You project your astral self onto the Astral
 Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel a
strally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.
\par While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at a
ll times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains i
n
visibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to
 function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
\par You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind i
n a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as }{\i\fs20\cf0 dispel magic }{\fs20\cf0 
cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes
\par This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The cre
ature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, }{\i\fs20\cf0 atonement }{\fs20\cf0 
operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject\rquote 
s burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see }{\i\fs20\cf0 geas/quest}{\fs20\cf0 ) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the }{\i\fs20\cf0 atonement }{\fs20\cf0 
spell on its behalf.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Atonement }{\fs20\cf0 may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Reverse Magical Alignment Change: }{\fs20\cf0 If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, }{\i\fs20\cf0 atonement }{\fs20\cf0 returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Restore Class: }{\fs20\cf0 A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: }{\fs20\cf0 A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking }{\i\fs20\cf0 atonement }{\fs20\cf0 
from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Redemption or Temptation: }{\fs20\cf0 You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment 
in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces 
t
o your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or
 any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.
\par Though the spell description refers to evil acts, }{\i\fs20\cf0 atonement }{\fs20\cf0 can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Note: }{\fs20\cf0 Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of }{\i\fs20\cf0 atonement }{\fs20\cf0 simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 Burning incense.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Focus: }{\fs20\cf0 In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 XP Cost: }{\fs20\cf0 When cast for the benefit of a creature whose guilt was the result of deliberate acts, the cost to you is 500 XP per casting (see above).

\par The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague a
s to have no chance of success. If the }{\i\fs20\cf0 augury }{\fs20\cf0 succeeds, you get one of four results:

\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Weal and woe (for both).
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Nothing (for actions that don\rquote t have especially good or bad results).
\par If the spell fails, you get the \'93nothing\'94 result. A cleric who gets the \'93nothing\'94 result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful }{\i\fs20\cf0 augury.
\par }{\fs20\cf0 The }{\i\fs20\cf0 augury }{\fs20\cf0 can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything t
hat might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All }{\i\fs20\cf0 auguries }{\fs20\cf0 
cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.

plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human\rquote s.
\par An }{\i\fs20\cf0 awakened }{\fs20\cf0 animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can\rquote t serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.

\par A }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.
\par You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts }{\i\fs20\cf0 suggestion}{\fs20\cf0 , your caster level for this casting of }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 increases by 1. For each assistant who casts }{
\i\fs20\cf0 dominate animal, dominate person, }{\fs20\cf0 or }{\i\fs20\cf0 dominate monster, }{\fs20\cf0 your caster level for this casting of }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant\rquote 
s level, provided that the spell\rquote s target is appropriate for a }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 spell. Since the assistants\rquote  spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 
spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants\rquote  spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 lasts. All }{\i\fs20\cf0 
binding }{\fs20\cf0 spells are dismissible.
\par Regardless of the version of }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 you cast, you can specify triggering conditions tha
t end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature\rquote 
s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don\rquote 
t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.
\par If you are casting any of the first three versions of }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 (those with limited durations), you may cast additional }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do s
o, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell\rquote s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 
spells it has received are broken.
\par The }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Chaining: }{\fs20\cf0 The subject is confined by restraints that generate an }{\i\fs20\cf0 antipathy }{\fs20\cf0 spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year p
er caster level. The subject of this form of }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Slumber: }{\fs20\cf0 This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while }{\i\fs20\cf0 slumbering}{\fs20\cf0 , nor does it age. This form of }{
\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 is more difficult to cast than }{\i\fs20\cf0 chaining}{\fs20\cf0 , making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell\rquote s save DC by 1.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Bound Slumber: }{\fs20\cf0 This combination of }{\i\fs20\cf0 chaining }{\fs20\cf0 and }{\i\fs20\cf0 slumber }{\fs20\cf0 lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Hedged Prison: }{\fs20\cf0 The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Metamorphosis: }{\fs20\cf0 
The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the c
ontainer, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0 is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while }{\i\fs20\cf0 metamorphosed}{\fs20\cf0 , nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.

\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Minimus Containment: }{\fs20\cf0 The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 binding }{\fs20\cf0

\par Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple che

\par Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.

\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Blinking }{\fs20\cf0 has several effects, as follows.
\par Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn\rquote t help opponents, since you\rquote 
re ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).
\par If the attacker can see invisible c
reatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.

\par Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you\rquote re }{\i\fs20\cf0 blinking }{\fs20\cf0 
unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.
\par While }{\i\fs20\cf0 blinking}{\fs20\cf0 , you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterit
y bonus to AC.
\par You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.
\par While }{\i\fs20\cf0 blinking}{\fs20\cf0 , you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance 
that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend
 about half your time there and half your time material.)
\par Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
\par An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
\par An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
\par Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can\rquote 
t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.
