\par Because psionic feats are supernatural abilities\emdash a departure from the general rule that feats do not grant supernatural abilities\emdash 
they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resi
stance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a }{\i null psionics field. }{Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.
\par Many psionic feats can be used only when you are psionical
ly focused; others require you to expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the act
ion for which you expended it.

items. Doing so, however, is draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.
\par A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.
\par }{\b XP Cost:}{ Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation feat equa
ls 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping th
e XP to advance a level.
\par }{\b Raw Materials Cost:}{ Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.
\par Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he\rquote 
s traveling far from home).
\par }{\b Time:}{ The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.
\par }{\b Item Cost:}{ Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items depends on their manifester level\emdash that i
s, a power from such an item has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when makin
g such an item, the item\rquote s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the character\rquote 
s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the item\rquote s co
st increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power forged into
 the item are set according to the effective manifester level.
\par The price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the power and a character\rquote s manifester level. The character\rquote s manifester level must be
 high enough that the item creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character\rquote s manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.
\par }{\i Power Stones: }{Base price = power level x manifester level x 25 gp
\par }{\i Psionic Tattoos: }{Base price = power level x manifester level x 50 gp
\par }{\i Dorjes: }{Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp
\par }{\b Extra Costs:}{ Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. 
\par For psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost. 
\par Some psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.

\par METAPSIONIC FEATS

s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a
 metapsionic feat is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.
\par }{\b Manifesting Time:}{ Powers manifested using metapsionic feats take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise.
\par }{\b Manifestation Cost:}{ To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat description.
\par }{\b Limits on Use:}{ As with all powers, you cannot spend more power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this rule. 
\par }{\b Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power:}{ In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its o
riginal power level, even though it costs additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can\rquote 
t use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.
\par Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
\par Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.
\par }{\b Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers:}{ With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the power\rquote s higher metapsionic level. 

\par A character doesn\rquote t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.

\par FEAT DESCRIPTIONS
\par }{These feat descriptions follow the standard format.
\par }{\fs24 
\par ALIGNED ATTACK }{[PSIONIC]
\par Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your opponent\rquote s alignment-based damage reduction and deals additional damage.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Base attack bonus +6.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law. (Your choice must match one of your alignment components. Once you\rquote ve made this alignment choice, it cannot be changed.
\par To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you make a successful melee or ranged attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, and your attack is treated as either a good, evil, chaotic, 
or lawful attack (depending on your original choice) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
\par You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.
\par }{\fs24 
\par ANTIPSIONIC MAGIC }{[GENERAL]
\par Your spells are more potent when used against psionic characters and creatures.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Spellcraft 5 ranks.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You get a get a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome a psionic creature\rquote s power resistance.
\par This bonus stacks with the bonus conferred by Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration. Moreover, whenever a psionic creature attempts to dispel a spell you cast, it makes its manifester level check against a DC of 13 + its manifester level.
\par The benefits of this feat apply only to power resistance. 
\par The bonus does not apply to spell resistance. This is an exception to the psionics\endash magic transparency rule.
\par }{\b Special:}{ You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
\par }{\fs24 
\par AUTONOMOUS }{[GENERAL]
\par You have a knack for psionic self-sufficiency.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You get a +2 bonus on all Autohypnosis checks and Knowledge (psionics) checks.
\par }{\fs24 
\par BODY FUEL }{[PSIONIC]
\par You can expand your power point total at the expense of your health.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You can recover 2 power points by taking 1 point of ability burn damage to each of your three ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
\par You can recover additional power points for a proportional cost to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. These recovered points are added to your power point reserve as if you had gained them by resting overnight.
\par }{\b Special:}{ Only living creatures can use this feat. You can take advantage of this feat only while in your own body.
\par }{\fs24 
\par BOOST CONSTRUCT }{[PSIONIC]
\par Your astral constructs have more abilities.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ When you create an astral construct, you can give it one additional special ability from any menu that the construct currently has an ability from.
\par }{\fs24 
\par BURROWING POWER }{[METAPSIONIC]
\par Your powers sometimes bypass barriers.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to bypass the barrier.
\par The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier with your power, you make a Psicraft check against a DC equal to 10 + th
e hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a }{\i wall of ectoplasm}{). Force walls or }{\i walls of ectoplasm }{
are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted otherwise.
\par If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an area), you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with }{\i clairvoyant sense}{
. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power\rquote s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
\par }{\fs24 
\par CHAIN POWER }{[METAPSIONIC]
\par You can manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary target. 
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ To
 use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can chain any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary t
argets equal to your manifester level (maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (round down).
\par Each target gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary
 targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).
\par Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power\rquote s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
\par }{\fs24 
\par CHAOTIC MIND }{[GENERAL]
\par The turbulence of your thoughts prevents others from gaining insight into your actions.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Chaotic alignment, Cha 15.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ Creatures and characters who have an insight bonus on their attack rolls, an insight bonus to their Armor Class, or an insight bonus on skill checks or ability checks do not gain those bonuses against you.
\par The benefit of this feat applies only to insight bonuses gained from psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics\endash magic transparency rule.
\par }{\b Special:}{ You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
\par }{\fs24 
\par CLOAK DANCE }{[GENERAL]
\par You are skilled at using optical tricks to make yourself seem to be where you are not.
\par }{\b Prerequisites:}{ Hide 10 ranks, Perform (dance) 2 ranks.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You can take a move action to obscure your
 exact position. Until your next turn, you have concealment. Alternatively, you can take a full-round action to entirely obscure your exact position. Until your next action, you have total concealment.
\par }{\fs24 
\par CLOSED MIND }{[GENERAL]
\par Your mind is better able to resist psionics than normal.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You get a +2 bonus on all saving throws to resist powers.
\par The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics\endash magic transparency rule.
\par }{\b Special:}{ You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
\par }{\fs24 
\par COMBAT MANIFESTATION }{[PSIONIC]
\par You are adept at manifesting powers in combat.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You get a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability while on the defensive or while you are grappling or pinned.
\par }{\fs24 
\par CRAFT COGNIZANCE CRYSTAL }{[ITEM CREATION]
\par You can create psionic }{\i cognizance crystals }{that store power points.
\par }{\b Prerequisite: }{Manifester level 3rd.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You can create a }{\i cognizance crystal}{. Doing so takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a }{\i cognizance crystal }{is equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all i
ts stored power points, squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp. To create a }{\i cognizance crystal}{, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half its base price.
\par }{\fs24 
\par CRAFT DORJE }{[ITEM CREATION]
\par You can create slender crystal wands called dorjes than manifest powers when charges are expended.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Manifester level 5th.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You can create a dorje of any psionic power you know (barring exceptions, such as }{\i bestow power}{, as noted in a power\rquote s description). Crafting a dorje
 takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a dorje is its manifester level x the power level x 750 gp. To craft a dorje, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.

\par A newly created dorje has 50 charges.
\par Any dorje that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the XP cost derived from the base price, you must pay fifty times the XP cost.
\par }{\fs24 
\par CRAFT PSICROWN }{[ITEM CREATION]
\par You can create psicrowns, which have multiple psionic effects.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Manifester level 12th.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You can create any psicrown whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a psicrown takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a psicrown, you must 
spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. Some psicrowns incur extra costs in XP as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the psicrown\rquote s base price.

\par }{\fs24 
\par CRAFT PSIONIC ARMS AND ARMOR }{[ITEM CREATION]
\par You can create psionic weapons, armor, and shields.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Manifester level 5th.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You can create any psionic weapon, armor, or shield whose prerequisites you meet. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shiel
d takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its psionic features. To enhance a weapon, you must spend 1/25 of its features\rquote  total price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this total price.
\par The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost.
\par You can also mend a broken psionic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to enhance that item in the first place.
\par }{\fs24 
\par CRAFT PSIONIC CONSTRUCT }{[ITEM CREATION]
\par You can create golems and other psionic automatons that obey your orders.
\par }{\b Prerequisites:}{ Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, Craft Universal Item.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You can create any psionic construct whose prerequisites you meet. Creating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To create a construct, you must spend 1/25 of the construct\rquote 
s base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this price. A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.
\par }{\fs24 
\par CRAFT UNIVERSAL ITEM }{[ITEM CREATION]
\par You can create universal psionic items.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Manifester level 3rd.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You can create any universal psionic item whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a universal psionic item takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a universal psionic item, you must spend 1/25 of the item\rquote 
s base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this price.
\par You can also mend a broken universal item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.
\par Some universal items incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the item\rquote s base price. You must pay such a cost to create an item or to mend a broken one.
\par }{\fs24 
\par DEADLY PRECISION }{[GENERAL]
\par You empty your mind of all distracting emotion, becoming an instrument of deadly precision.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Dex 15, base attack bonus +5.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ You have deadly accuracy with your sneak attacks. You can reroll any result of 1 on your sneak attack\rquote s extra damage dice. You must keep the result of the reroll, even if it is another 1.
\par }{\fs24 
\par DEEP IMPACT }{[PSIONIC]
\par You can strike your foe with a melee weapon as if making a touch attack.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Str 13, Psionic Weapon, base attack bonus +5.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can resolve your attack with a m
elee weapon as a touch attack. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.
\par }{\fs24 
\par DELAY POWER }{[METAPSIONIC]
\par You can manifest powers that go off up to 5 rounds later.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can manifest a power as a delayed power. A delayed power doesn\rquote 
t activate immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three trigger mechanisms: (1) The power activates when you t
ake a standard action to activate it; (2) It activates when a creature enters the area that the power will affect (only powers that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of th
e first two triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates automatically on the fifth round.
\par Only area and personal powers can be delayed.
\par Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designatin
g targets, or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the power is manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected by the power, including saving throws, are decided when the delay period ends.
\par A delayed power can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target by the use of powers that can detect psionic effects. 
\par Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power\rquote s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
\par }{\fs24 
\par EMPOWER POWER }{[METAPSIONIC]
\par You can manifest powers to greater effect.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.
\par You can empower a power. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered power are increased by one-half. An empowered power deals
 half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Augmented powers can also be empowered (multiply 1-1/2 times the damage total of the augmented power). Saving thro
ws and opposed checks (such as the one you make when you manifest }{\i dispel psionics}{) are not affected, nor are powers without random variables.
\par Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power\rquote s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
\par }{\fs24 
\par ENLARGE POWER }{[METAPSIONIC]
\par You can manifest powers farther than normal.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter a power with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. An enlarged powe
r with a range of close has a range of 50 feet + 5 feet per level, a medium-range power has a range of 200 feet + 20 feet per level, and a long-range power has a range of 800 feet + 80 feet per level.
\par Powers whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as powers whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, are
\par not affected.
\par Using this feat does not increase the power point cost of the power.
\par }{\fs24

age as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can 
make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.
\par }{\b Special:}{ You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who i
s within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.

\par WIDEN POWER }{[METAPSIONIC]
\par You can increase the area of your powers.

nts of the power\rquote s area increase by 100%.
\par Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power\rquote s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

\par WILD TALENT }{[GENERAL]
\par Your mind wakes to a previously unrealized talent for psionics.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{
 Your latent power of psionics flares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. 
You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by virtue of having this feat.

\par WOUNDING ATTACK }{[PSIONIC]
\par Your vicious attacks wound your foe.
\par }{\b Prerequisite:}{ Base attack bonus +8.
\par }{\b Benefit:}{ To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can make an attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1 point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt.
\par You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.
