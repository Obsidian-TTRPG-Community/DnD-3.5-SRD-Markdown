\par You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the }{\i\fs20\cf0 fabricate }{\fs20\cf0 spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate w
ith the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet.
\par You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.
\par Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be affected by the spell.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 The original material, which costs the same amount as the raw materials required to craft the item to be created.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 Faerie Fire
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Evocation [Light]
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Drd 1

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes
\par A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical }{\i\fs20\cf0 darkness }{\fs20\cf0 
effect functions normally), }{\i\fs20\cf0 blur}{\fs20\cf0 , displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 faerie fire }{
\fs20\cf0 can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 faerie fire }{\fs20\cf0 does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

\par You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 +1 per caster level (maximum +10).
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 A small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits, which you use to trace certain sigils on your body during casting. These sigils cannot be seen once the alcohol or spirits evaporate.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 False Vision
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Illusion (Glamer)

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw:}{\fs20\cf0  None
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  No
\par Any divination (scrying) spell used to view anything within the area of this spell instead receives a false image (as the }{\i\fs20\cf0 major image }{\fs20\cf0 
spell), as defined by you at the time of casting. As long as the duration lasts, you can concentrate to change the image as desired. While you aren\rquote t concentrating, the image remains static.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Arcane Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 The ground dust of a piece of jade worth at least 250 gp, which is sprinkled into the air when the spell is cast.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 Fear
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Necromancy [Fear, Mind-Affecting]
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 4

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  1 standard action
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  30 ft.
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Area:}{\fs20\cf0  Cone-shaped burst
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  1 round/level or 1 round; see text
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw: }{\fs20\cf0 Will partial
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes
\par An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in the area to become panicked unless it succeeds on a Will save. If cornered, a panicked creature begins cowering. If the Will save succeeds, the creature is shaken for 1 round.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 Either the heart of a hen or a white feather.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 Feather Fall
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Transmutation
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Components:}{\fs20\cf0  V
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  1 free action
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Targets:}{\fs20\cf0  One Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  Until landing or 1 round/level
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw: }{\fs20\cf0 Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes (object)
\par The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Feather fall }{\fs20\cf0 
instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. How
ever, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
\par The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature\rquote s maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A 
Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
\par You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fal
l. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn\rquote t your turn.
\par This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Feather fall }{\fs20\cf0 works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 Feeblemind
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Sor/Wiz 5
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Components:}{\fs20\cf0  V, S, M

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Target:}{\fs20\cf0  One creature
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  Instantaneous
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw: }{\fs20\cf0 Will negates; see text
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes
\par If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, its Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language
, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a }{\i\fs20\cf0 heal}{\fs20\cf0 , }{\i\fs20\cf0 limited wish}{\fs20\cf0 , }{\i\fs20\cf0 miracle}{\fs20\cf0 
, or }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 spell is used to cancel the effect of the }{\i\fs20\cf0 feeblemind}{\fs20\cf0 . A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a \endash 4 penalty on its saving throw.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 A handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 Find the Path
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Divination
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Brd 6, Clr 6, Drd 6, Knowledge 6, Travel 6

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  3 rounds
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Personal or touch
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Target:}{\fs20\cf0  You or creature touched
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  10 min./level
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw:}{\fs20\cf0  None or Will negates (harmless)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  No or Yes (harmless)
\par The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a }{\i\fs20\cf0 maze }{\fs20\cf0 spell. }{\i\fs20\cf0 
Find the path }{\fs20\cf0 works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
\par The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times 
the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph of warding. }{\fs20\cf0 
The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Find the path }{\fs20\cf0 can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a }{\i\fs20\cf0 maze }{\fs20\cf0 
spell in a single round.
\par This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians).
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Focus: }{\fs20\cf0 A set of divination counters of the sort you favor.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 Find Traps
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Divination

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Personal
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Target:}{\fs20\cf0  You
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  1 min./level
\par You gain intuitive insight into the wo
rkings of traps. You can use the Search skill to detect traps just as a rogue can. In addition, you gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (maximum +10) on Search checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect.
\par Note that }{\i\fs20\cf0 find traps }{\fs20\cf0 grants no ability to disable the traps that you may find.

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw:}{\fs20\cf0  Fortitude partial
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes
\par You can slay any one living creature within range. The target is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to survive the attack. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +25).
\par The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 Fire Seeds
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Conjuration (Creation) [Fire]
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Drd 6, Fire 6, Sun 6
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Components:}{\fs20\cf0  V, S, M
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  1 standard action
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Touch
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Targets:}{\fs20\cf0  Up to four touched acorns or up to eight touched holly berries
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  10 min./level or until used
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw:}{\fs20\cf0  None or Reflex half; see text
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  No
\par Depending on the version of }{\i\fs20\cf0 fire seeds }{\fs20\cf0 you choose, you turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Acorn Grenades: }{\fs20\cf0 As many as four acorns turn into special splash weapons that can be hurled as far as 100 feet. A ranged touch atta
ck roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), divided up among the acorns as you wish.
\par Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. In additi
on to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet. A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly i
s not allowed a saving throw.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Holly Berry Bombs: }{\fs20\cf0 You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). If you are
 within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature i
n the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 The acorns or holly berries.
\par 
\par }{\cf0 Fire Shield
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Evocation [Fire or Cold]
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Fire 5, Sor/Wiz 4, Sun 4

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  1 standard action
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Personal
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Target:}{\fs20\cf0  You
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  1 round/level (D)
\par This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).
\par Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if the }{\i\fs20\cf0 shield }{
\fs20\cf0 protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the }{\i\fs20\cf0 shield }{\fs20\cf0 
protects against cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
\par When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)
\emdash blue or green if the }{\i\fs20\cf0 chill shield }{\fs20\cf0 is cast, violet or blue if the }{\i\fs20\cf0 warm shield }{\fs20\cf0 is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Warm Shield: }{\fs20\cf0 The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

\par You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the }{\i\fs20\cf0 fireball }{\fs20\cf0 is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impa

at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must \'93hit\'94
 the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
\par The }{\i\fs20\cf0 fireball }{\fs20\cf0 sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead,

\par Should the spell duration expire whil

\par This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once }{\i\fs20\cf0 foresight }{\fs20\cf0 
is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the sp
ell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
\par When another creature is the subject of
 the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person 
b
ack, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex sav
es.

\par If the }{\i\fs20\cf0 freezing sphere }{\fs20\cf0 
strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10- foot square) per caster level (maximum 1,50
0 square feet). This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a D
C 25 Escape Artist check to do so.
\par You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the }{\i\fs20\cf0

\rquote t atta

 also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gaseous form }{\fs20\cf0 spell takes effect.

\par Casting a }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
\par Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate.
\par }{\fs20\cf0 The }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster\rquote s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and
 facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
\par A }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Planar Travel: }{\fs20\cf0 As a mode of planar travel, a }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 spell functions much like a }{\i\fs20\cf0 plane shift }{\fs20\cf0 spell, except that the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 
opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 
from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you\emdash anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 
cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
\par You may hold the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Calling Creatures: }{\fs20\cf0 The second effect of the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 
spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 to open in th
e immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate, }{\fs20\cf0 
although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).
\par If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or sev
eral creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD th
an twice your caster level can\rquote 
t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.
\par A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished with
in 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature\rquote s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.
\par If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the }{\i\fs20\cf0 
lesser planar ally }{\fs20\cf0 spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in \'93livestock\'94
 rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instan
tly freed to return to its own plane.
\par Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Note: }{\fs20\cf0 When you use a calling spell such as }{\i\fs20\cf0 gate }{\fs20\cf0 to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 XP Cost: }{\fs20\cf0 1,000 XP (only for the }{\i\fs20\cf0 calling creatures }{\fs20\cf0 function).

places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you. While a }{\i\fs20\cf0 geas }{\fs20\cf0

\par If the subject is prevented from obeying the }{\i\fs20\cf0 lesser geas }{\fs20\cf0 for 24 hours, it takes a \endash 2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another \endash 2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of \endash 
8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the }{\i\fs20\cf0 lesser geas.

\par This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph of warding }{\fs20\cf0 can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.
\par You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a pas
sword trigger, }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyphs }{\fs20\cf0 can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Glyphs }{\fs20\cf0 
can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Glyphs }{\fs20\cf0 
respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyphs }{\fs20\cf0 cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.

\par When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph }{\fs20\cf0 can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the }{
\i\fs20\cf0 glyph }{\fs20\cf0 and tracery become nearly invisible.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Glyphs }{\fs20\cf0 cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Mislead}{\fs20\cf0 , }{\i\fs20\cf0 polymorph}{\fs20\cf0 , and }{\i\fs20\cf0 nondetection }{\fs20\cf0 
(and similar magical effects) can fool a }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph}{\fs20\cf0 , though nonmagical disguises and the like can\rquote t. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Read magic }{\fs20\cf0 allows you to identify a }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph of warding }{\fs20\cf0 
with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph }{\fs20\cf0 does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph }{\fs20\cf0 (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Note: }{\fs20\cf0 Magic traps such as }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph of warding }{\fs20\cf0 are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph }{\fs20\cf0 and Disable Device to thwart it. 
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph of warding}{\fs20\cf0 .
\par Depending on the version selected, a }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph }{\fs20\cf0 either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Blast Glyph: }{\fs20\cf0 A }{\i\fs20\cf0 blast glyph }{\fs20\cf0 deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to th
e intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster\rquote 
s choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Spell Glyph: }{\fs20\cf0 You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph. }{\fs20\cf0 
If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If th
e spell has an area or an amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the D
C is based on the level of the spell stored in the }{\i\fs20\cf0 glyph}{\fs20\cf0 .

\par A }{\i\fs20\cf0 grease }{\fs20\cf0 spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery
 grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half 
normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can\rquote t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).
\par The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating 
on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A 
saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the }{\i\fs20\cf0 greased }{\fs20\cf0 item. A creature wearing }{\i\fs20\cf0 greased }{\fs20\cf0
