\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  1 standard action

\par You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Sustained Force: }{\fs20\cf0 
A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.

\par This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range
. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.
\par An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turn
ed, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Combat Maneuver: }{\fs20\cf0 Alternatively, once per round, you can use }{\i\fs20\cf0 telekinesis }{\fs20\cf0 to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don\rquote 
t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and gra
pple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn\rquote 
t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.

\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Violent Thrust: }{\fs20\cf0 Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can h
url one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375
 pounds at 15th level).
\par You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standa
rd damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (
for hard, dense objects).
\par Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed 
creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).

\par }{\fs20\cf0 Evocation [Force]
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Sor/Wiz 8
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Components:}{\fs20\cf0  V, S, M
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  1 standard action
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Effect:}{\fs20\cf0  1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around creatures or objects
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  1 min./level (D)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw:}{\fs20\cf0  Reflex negates (object)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  Yes (object)
\par This spell functions like }{\i\fs20\cf0 resilient sphere, }{\fs20\cf0 with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within an }{\i\fs20\cf0 telekinetic sphere }{\fs20\cf0 
weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control ex
tends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents.
\par You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere
. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a le
vel surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the spell\rquote 
s duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell\rquote s duration.
\par The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.
\par You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 A hemispherical piece of clear crystal, a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic, and a pair of small bar magnets.

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  1 standard action
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Targets:}{\fs20\cf0  You plus one willing creature per three levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  10 min./level (D)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Saving Throw:}{\fs20\cf0  None
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  No
\par You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number o
f willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or in
fluence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).
\par If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Telepathic bond }{\fs20\cf0 can be made permanent with a }{\i\fs20\cf0 permanency }{\fs20\cf0 spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of }{\i\fs20\cf0 permanency}{\fs20\cf0 .
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures.

\par }{\cf0 Teleport
\par }{\fs20\cf0 Conjuration (Teleportation)
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Level:}{\fs20\cf0  Sor/Wiz 5, Travel 5
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Components:}{\fs20\cf0  V
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Casting Time:}{\fs20\cf0  1 standard action
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Range:}{\fs20\cf0  Personal and touch
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Target:}{\fs20\cf0  You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures
\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Duration:}{\fs20\cf0  Instantaneous

\par }{\b\fs20\cf0 Spell Resistance:}{\fs20\cf0  No and Yes (object)
\par This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\rquote t exceed your maximum
 load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as
 
two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not mak
e a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.
\par You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

\par To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Familiarity: }{\fs20\cf0 \'93Very familiar\'94 is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. \'93Studied carefully\'94 is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you\rquote ve been 
there often, or you have used other means (such as }{\i\fs20\cf0 scrying}{\fs20\cf0 ) to study the place for at least one hour. \'93Seen casually\'94 is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. \'93Viewed once
\'94 is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. 
\par \'93False destination\'94 is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to
 a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 On Target: }{\fs20\cf0 You appear where you want to be.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Off Target: }{\fs20\cf0 You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Similar Area: }{\fs20\cf0 You wind up in an area that\rquote s visually or thematically similar to the target area.
\par Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell\rquote s range, the spell simply fails instead.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Mishap: }{\fs20\cf0 You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \'93scrambled.\'94 You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \'93Mishap\'94
 comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

\par You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\rquote t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three
 caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transp
orted must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
\par You can\rquote t use this spell to travel through plant creatures.
\par The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from the tree.

\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Trap the soul }{\fs20\cf0 forces a creature\rquote s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the
 life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imp
risoning it is broken.
\par Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Spell Completion: }{\fs20\cf0 First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final
 word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature\rquote 
s name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Trigger Object: }{\fs20\cf0 The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature\rquote 
s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature\rquote s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 sympathy }{\fs20\cf0 
spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 Before the actual casting of }{\i\fs20\cf0 trap the soul, }{\fs20\cf0 you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit 
Die possessed by the creature to be trapped. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researche
d. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Focus (Trigger Object Only): }{\fs20\cf0 If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as described above, is needed.

\par By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs
. The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a }{\i\fs20\cf0 detect magic }{\fs20\cf0 
spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form,
 you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You
 are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you.

 to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.

\par An }{\i\fs20\cf0 unseen servant }{\fs20\cf0 
is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, bu
t it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It c
an trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can\rquote 
t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can\rquote t be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.
\par The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell\rquote 
s range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

\par An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to tho
se past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any cr
eature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.
\par If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage
 or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects.)

\par This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of ice }{\fs20\cf0 
cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it i
s created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of ice, }{\fs20\cf0 
and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of ice }{\fs20\cf0 creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Ice Plane: }{\fs20\cf0 A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10t
h-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is
 anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
\par Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A sectio
n of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
\par Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Hemisphere: }{\fs20\cf0 The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 hemisphere }{\fs20\cf0 is as hard to break through as the }{\i\fs20\cf0 ice plane }{\fs20\cf0 
form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.

\par You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. 
It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.
\par A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of iron }{\fs20\cf0 is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall\rquote s area by halving its thickness. Each 5- foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per 
inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
\par If you desire, the wall can be c
reated vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one di
r
ection rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 p
oints of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.
\par Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

\par This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of stone }{\fs20\cf0 is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall\rquote 
s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
\par Unlike a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of iron, }{\fs20\cf0 you can create a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of stone }{\fs20\cf0 in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be ver
tical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and but
tressed. This requirement reduces the spell\rquote s area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.
\par Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a }{\i\fs20\cf0 disintegrate }{\fs20\cf0 spell or by no
rmal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, 
the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.
\par It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of stone}{\fs20\cf0 , provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

\par A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of thorns }{\fs20\cf0 spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human\rquote s finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of thorns 
}{\fs20\cf0 takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature\rquote s AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class o
f 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)
\par You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your cast
er level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
\par Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as
 a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creat
ure trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
\par Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must att
empt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of thorns }{\fs20\cf0 at normal speed without taking damage.
\par A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of thorns }{\fs20\cf0 can be breached by slow work wit
h edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.
\par Despite its appearance, a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wall of thorns }{\fs20\cf0 is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.

\par If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in), the subjects are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.

\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Web }{\fs20\cf0 creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The stra
nds are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a }{\i\fs20\cf0 web }{\fs20\cf0 
become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won\rquote t cause you to become entangled.
\par Anyone in the effect\rquote s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from
 moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can\rquote 
t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Ar
tist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the }{\i\fs20\cf0 web }{\fs20\cf0 
very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.
\par If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.
\par The strands of a }{\i\fs20\cf0 web }{\fs20\cf0 spell are flammable. A magic }{\i\fs20\cf0 flaming sword }{\fs20\cf0 
can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Web }{\fs20\cf0 can be made permanent with a }{\i\fs20\cf0 permanency }{\fs20\cf0 spell. A permanent }{\i\fs20\cf0 web }{\fs20\cf0 that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

\par This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone\rquote s every movement or specify a simple program. Di
recting the cyclone\rquote s movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell\rquote 
s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can\rquote t regain control of the cyclone, even if comes back within range.)
\par Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails i
ts first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures 
whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

\par You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 whispering wind }{\fs20\cf0 travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 
whispering wind }{\fs20\cf0 is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message 
is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
\par You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the }{\i\fs20\cf0 whispering wind }{\fs20\cf0 
seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the }{\i\fs20\cf0 whispering wind }{\fs20\cf0 to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.
\par When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with }{\i\fs20\cf0 magic mouth, whispering wind }{\fs20\cf0 cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

\par You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the }{\i\fs20\cf0 gaseous form }{\fs20\cf0 spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
\par Normally, a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wind walker }{\fs20\cf0 flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wind walker }{\fs20\cf0 
along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. }{\i\fs20\cf0 Wind walkers }{\fs20\cf0 
are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
\par A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wind walker }{\fs20\cf0 
can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you c
an dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.
\par For the last minute of the spell\rquote s duration, a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wind walker }{\fs20\cf0 in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend
 faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

\par An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast s
ufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loo
se materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wind wall. }{\fs20\cf0 
Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, a
nd other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).

\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Wish }{\fs20\cf0 is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
\par Even }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish}{\fs20\cf0 , however, has its limits.
\par A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 can produce any one of the following effects.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it\rquote s of a prohibited school.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it\rquote s of a prohibited school. 
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as }{\i\fs20\cf0 geas/quest }{\fs20\cf0 or }{\i\fs20\cf0 insanity}{\fs20\cf0 .
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 
spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. }{
\i\fs20\cf0 Note: }{\fs20\cf0 An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Remove injuries and afflictions. A single }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affli
ction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish}{\fs20\cf0 . A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 
can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Revive the dead. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a }{\i\fs20\cf0 resurrection }{\fs20\cf0 spell. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 
can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two }{\i\fs20\cf0 wishes, }{\fs20\cf0 one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 
cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Transport travelers. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere 
on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
\par }{\cf0 \bullet  }{\fs20\cf0 Undo misfortune. A }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 can undo a single recent event. The }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 
forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 could undo an opponent\rquote s successful save, a foe\rquote 
s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend\rquote 
s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
\par You may try to use a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)

\par Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 Material Component: }{\fs20\cf0 When a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.
\par }{\i\fs20\cf0 XP Cost: }{\fs20\cf0 The minimum XP cost for casting }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 is 5,000 XP. When a }{\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a }{
\i\fs20\cf0 wish }{\fs20\cf0 creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place rega

teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 f
eet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn\rquote

nal willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures
 to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.
