four basic dungeon types are defined by their current status. Many dungeons are
variations on these basic types or combinations of more than one of them.
Sometimes old dungeons are used again and again by different inhabitants for
different purposes.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ruined
Structure:</span><span>
Once occupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its
original creator or creators, and other creatures have wandered in. Many
subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground constructions in which to
make their lairs. Any traps that might exist have probably been set off, but
wandering beasts might very well be common.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Occupied
Structure:</span><span>
This type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent) live
there, although they may not be the dungeon’s creators. An occupied structure
might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active mine, a prison, or a
headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely to have traps or wandering
beasts, and more likely to have organized guards—both on watch and on patrol.
Traps or wandering beasts that might be encountered are usually under the
control of the occupants. Occupied structures have furnishings to suit the
inhabitants, as well as decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to
move around (doors they can open, hallways large enough for them to pass
through, and so on). The inhabitants might have a communication system, and
they almost certainly control an access to the outside.</span></p><p>Some
dungeons are partially occupied and partially empty or in ruins. In such cases,
the occupants are typically not the original builders but instead a group of
intelligent creatures that have set up their base, lair, or fortification
within an abandoned dungeon.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Safe
Storage: </span><span>When
people want to protect something, they might bury it underground. Whether the
item they want to protect is a fabulous treasure, a forbidden artifact, or the
dead body of an important figure, these valuable objects are placed within a
dungeon and surrounded by barriers, traps, and guardians.</span></p><p>The
safe storage type of dungeon is the most likely to have traps but the least
likely to have wandering beasts. This type of dungeon normally is built for
function rather than appearance, but sometimes it has ornamentation in the form
of statuary or painted walls. This is particularly true of the tombs of
important people.</p><p>Sometimes,
however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such a way as to house living
guardians. The problem with this strategy is that something must be done to
keep the creatures alive between intrusion attempts. Magic is usually the best
solution to provide food and water for these creatures. Even if there’s no way
anything living can survive in a safe storage dungeon, certain monsters can
still serve as guardians. Builders of vaults or tombs often place undead
creatures or constructs, both of which which have no need for sustenance or
rest, to guard their dungeons. Magic traps can attack intruders by summoning
monsters into the dungeon. These guardians also need no sustenance, since they
appear only when they’re needed and disappear when their task is done.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Natural
Cavern Complex:</span><span>
Underground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean monsters. Created
naturally and connected by a labyrinthine tunnel system, these caverns lack any
sort of pattern, order, or decoration. With no intelligent force behind its
construction, this type of dungeon is the least likely to have traps or even
doors.</span></p><p>Fungi
of all sorts thrive in caves, sometimes growing in huge forests of mushrooms
and puffballs. Subterranean predators prowl these forests, looking for those
feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of fungus give off a phosphorescent
glow, providing a natural cavern complex with its own limited light source. In
other areas, a <span style="font-style: italic;">daylight </span>spell or similar magical effect can provide
enough light for green plants to grow.</p><p>Often,
a natural cavern complex connects with another type of dungeons, the caves
having been discovered when the manufactured dungeon was delved. A cavern
complex can connect two otherwise unrelated dungeons, sometimes creating a
strange mixed environment. A natural cavern complex joined with another dungeon
often provides a route by which subterranean creatures find their way into a
manufactured dungeon and populate it.</p></section></section><section id="h2-3-dungeon-terrain"><h2>DUNGEON TERRAIN</h2><section id="h3-4-walls"><h3>WALLS</h3><p>Sometimes,
masonry walls—stones piled on top of each other (usually but not always held in
place with mortar)—divide dungeons into corridors and chambers. Dungeon walls
can also be hewn from solid rock, leaving them with a rough, chiseled look. Or,
dungeon walls can be the smooth, unblemished stone of a naturally occurring
cave. Dungeon walls are difficult to break down or through, but they’re
generally easy to climb.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 39.9751em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="6" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table:

Walls:</span><span>
The most common kind of dungeon wall, masonry walls are usually at least 1 foot
thick. Often these ancient walls sport cracks and crevices, and sometimes
dangerous slimes or small monsters live in these areas and wait for prey.
Masonry walls stop all but the loudest noises. It takes a DC 20 Climb check to
travel along a masonry wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Superior
Masonry Walls:</span><span>
Sometimes masonry walls are better built (smoother, with tighter-fitting stones
and less cracking), and occasionally these superior walls are covered with
plaster or stucco. Covered walls often bear paintings, carved reliefs, or other
decoration. Superior masonry walls are no more difficult to destroy than
regular masonry walls but are more difficult to climb (DC 25).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Hewn
Stone Walls:</span><span>
Such walls usually result when a chamber or passage is tunneled out from solid
rock. The rough surface of a hewn wall frequently provides minuscule ledges
where fungus grows and fissures where vermin, bats, and subterranean snakes
live. When such a wall has an “other side” (it separates two chambers in the
dungeon), the wall is usually at least 3 feet thick; anything thinner risks
collapsing from the weight of all the stone overhead. It takes a DC 25 Climb
check to climb a hewn stone wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Unworked
Stone Walls:</span><span>
These surfaces are uneven and rarely flat. They are smooth to the touch but
filled with tiny holes, hidden alcoves, and ledges at various heights. They’re
also usually wet or at least damp, since it’s water that most frequently
creates natural caves. When such a wall has an “other side,” the wall is
usually at least 5 feet thick. It takes a DC 15 Climb check to move along an
unworked stone wall. </span></p></section><section id="h3-5-special-walls"><h3>SPECIAL WALLS</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Reinforced
Walls:</span><span>These are
masonry walls with iron bars on one or both sides of the wall, or placed within
the wall to strengthen it. The hardness of a reinforced wall remains the same,
but its hit points are doubled and the Strength check DC to break through it is
increased by 10.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Iron
Walls: </span><span>These
walls are placed within dungeons around important places such as vaults. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Paper
Walls:</span><span>Paper
walls are the opposite of iron walls, placed as screens to block line of sight
but nothing more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Wooden
Walls:</span><span>Wooden
walls often exist as recent additions to older dungeons, used to create animal
pens, storage bins, or just to make a number of smaller rooms out of a larger
one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Magically
Treated Walls:</span><span>These walls are stronger than average, with a greater
hardness, more hit points, and a higher break DC. Magic can usually double the
hardness and hit points and can add up to 20 to the break DC. A magically
treated wall also gains a saving throw against spells that could affect it,
with the save bonus equaling 2 + one-half the caster level of the magic
reinforcing the wall. Creating a magic wall requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat
and the expenditure of 1,500 gp for each 10 foot-by-10-foot wall section.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Walls
with Arrow Slits: </span><span>Walls with arrow slits can be made of any durable material
but are most commonly masonry, hewn stone, or wood. Such a wall allows
defenders to fire arrows or crossbow bolts at intruders from behind the safety
of the wall. Archers behind arrow slits have improved cover that gives them a
+8 bonus to Armor Class, a +4 bonus on Reflex saves, and the benefits of the
improved evasion class feature.</span></p></section><section id="h3-6-floors"><h3>FLOORS</h3><p>As
with walls, dungeon floors come in many types.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Flagstone:
</span><span>Like
masonry walls, flagstone floors are made of fitted stones. They are usually
cracked and only somewhat level. Slime and mold grows in these cracks.
Sometimes water runs in rivulets between the stones or sits in stagnant
puddles. Flagstone is the most common dungeon floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Uneven
Flagstone:</span><span>
Over time, some floors can become so uneven that a DC 10 Balance check is
required to run or charge across the surface. Failure means the character can’t
move in this round. Floors as treacherous as this should be the exception, not
the rule.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Hewn
Stone Floors:</span><span>
Rough and uneven, hewn floors are usually covered with loose stones, gravel,
dirt, or other debris. A DC 10 Balance check is required to run or charge
across such a floor. Failure means the character can still act, but can’t run
or charge in this round.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Light
Rubble: </span><span>Small
chunks of debris litter the ground. Light rubble adds 2 to the DC of Balance
and Tumble checks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dense
Rubble:</span><span>
The ground is covered with debris of all sizes. It costs 2 squares of movement
to enter a square with dense rubble. Dense rubble adds 5 to the DC of Balance
and Tumble checks, and it adds 2 to the DC of Move Silently checks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Smooth
Stone Floors:</span><span>
Finished and sometimes even polished, smooth floors are found only in dungeons
with capable and careful builders. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Natural
Stone Floors:</span><span>
The floor of a natural cave is as uneven as the walls. Caves rarely have flat
surfaces of any great size. Rather, their floors have many levels. Some
adjacent floor surfaces might vary in elevation by only a foot, so that moving
from one to the other is no more difficult than negotiating a stair step, but
in other places the floor might suddenly drop off or rise up several feet or
more, requiring Climb checks to get from one surface to the other. Unless a
path has been worn and well marked in the floor of a natural cave, it takes 2
squares of movement to enter a square with a natural stone floor, and the DC of
Balance and Tumble checks increases by 5. Running and charging are impossible,
except along paths.</span></p></section><section id="h3-7-special-floors"><h3>SPECIAL FLOORS</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Slippery:
</span><span>Water,
ice, slime, or blood can make any of the dungeon floors described in this
section more treacherous. Slippery floors increase the DC of Balance and Tumble
checks by 5. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Grate:
</span><span>A grate
often covers a pit or an area lower than the main floor. Grates are usually
made from iron, but large ones can also be made from iron-bound timbers. Many
grates have hinges to allow access to what lies below (such grates can be
locked like any door), while others are permanent and designed not to move. A
typical 1-inch-thick iron grate has 25 hit points, hardness 10, and a DC of 27
for Strength checks to break through it or tear it loose.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ledge:
</span><span>Ledges
allow creatures to walk above some lower area. They often circle around pits,
run along underground streams, form balconies around large rooms, or provide a
place for archers to stand while firing upon enemies below. Narrow ledges (12
inches wide or less) require those moving along them to make Balance checks.
Failure results in the moving character</span></p><p>falling
off the ledge. Ledges sometimes have railings. In such a case, characters gain
a +5 circumstance bonus on Balance checks to move along the ledge. A character
who is next to a railing gains a +2 circumstance bonus on his or her opposed
Strength check to avoid being bull rushed off the edge.</p><p>Ledges
can also have low walls 2 to 3 feet high along their edges. Such walls provide
cover against attackers within 30 feet on the other side of the wall, as long
as the target is closer to the low wall than the attacker is.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Transparent
Floor:</span><span>Transparent
floors, made of reinforced glass or magic materials (even a <span style="font-style: italic;">wall of force</span>),
allow a dangerous setting to be viewed safely from above. Transparent floors
are sometimes placed over lava pools, arenas, monster dens, and torture
chambers. They can be used by defenders to watch key areas for intruders.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Sliding
Floors:</span><span> A
sliding floor is a type of trapdoor, designed to be moved and thus reveal
something that lies beneath it. A typical sliding floor moves so slowly that
anyone standing on one can avoid falling into the gap it creates, assuming
there’s somewhere else to go. If such a floor slides quickly enough that
there’s a chance of a character falling into whatever lies beneath—a spiked
pit, a vat of burning oil, or a pool filled with sharks—then it’s a trap.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Trap
Floors:</span><span>
Some floors are designed to become suddenly dangerous. With the application of
just the right amount of weight, or the pull of a lever somewhere nearby,
spikes protrude from the floor, gouts of steam or flame shoot up from hidden
holes, or the entire floor tilts. These strange floors are sometimes found in
an arena, designed to make combats more exciting and deadly. Construct these
floors as you would any other trap. </span></p></section><section id="h3-8-doors"><h3>DOORS</h3><p>Doors
in dungeons are much more than mere entrances and exits. Often they can be

  DC to lift. Use appropriate door figure for breaking.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Wooden
Doors: </span><span>Constructed
of thick planks nailed together, sometimes bound with iron for strength (and to
reduce swelling from dungeon dampness), wooden doors are the most common type.
Wooden doors come in varying strengths: simple, good, and strong doors. Simple
doors (break DC 13) are not meant to keep out motivated attackers. Good doors
(break DC 16), while sturdy and long-lasting, are still not meant to take much
punishment. Strong doors (break DC 23) are bound in iron and are a sturdy
barrier to those attempting to get past them. Iron hinges fasten the door to
its frame, and typically a circular pull-ring in the center is there to help
open it. Sometimes, instead of a pull-ring, a door has an iron pull-bar on one
or both sides of the door to serve as a handle. In inhabited dungeons, these
doors are usually well maintained (not stuck) and unlocked, although important
areas are locked up if possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stone:</span><span> Carved from solid blocks
of stone, these heavy, unwieldy doors are often built so that they pivot when
opened, although dwarves and other skilled craftsfolk are able to fashion
hinges strong enough to hold up a stone door. Secret doors concealed within a
stone wall are usually stone doors. Otherwise, such doors stand as tough
barriers protecting something important beyond. Thus, they are often locked or
barred.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Iron:
</span><span>Rusted
but sturdy, iron doors in a dungeon are hinged like wooden doors. These doors
are the toughest form of nonmagical door. They are usually locked or barred.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Locks,
Bars, and Seals:</span><span>
Dungeon doors may be locked, trapped, reinforced, barred, magically sealed, or
sometimes just stuck. All but the weakest characters can eventually knock down
a door with a heavy tool such as a sledgehammer, and a number of spells and
magic items give characters an easy way around a locked door.</span></p><p>Attempts
to literally chop a door down with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon use the
hardness and hit points given in Table: Doors. Often the easiest way to
overcome a recalcitrant door is not by demolishing it but by breaking its lock,
bar, or hinges. When assigning a DC to an attempt to knock a door down, use the
following as guidelines:</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC
10 or Lower: </span><span>a
door just about anyone can break open.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC
11–15: </span><span>a
door that a strong person could break with one try and an average person might
be able to</span></p><p>break
with one try. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC
16–20: </span><span>a
door that almost anyone could break, given time.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC
21–25: </span><span>a
door that only a strong or very strong person has a hope of breaking, probably
not on the first try.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC
26 or Higher: </span><span>a
door that only an exceptionally strong person has a hope of breaking.</span></p><p>For
specific examples in applying these guidelines, see Table: Random Door Types. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Locks:</span><span> Dungeon doors are often
locked, and thus the Open Lock skill comes in very handy. Locks are usually
built into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges or right in the
middle of the door. Builtin locks either control an iron bar that juts out of the
door and into the wall of its frame, or else a sliding iron bar or heavy wooden
bar that rests behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in
but usually run through two rings, one on the door and the other on the wall.
More complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually
built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are larger and more
complex, they are typically only found in sturdy doors (strong wooden, stone,
or iron doors).</span></p><p>The
Open Lock DC to pick a lock often falls into the range of 20 to 30, although
locks with lower or higher DCs can exist. A door can have more than one lock,
each of which must be unlocked separately. Locks are often trapped, usually
with poison needles that extend out to prick a rogue’s finger.</p><p>Breaking
a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a PC wants to
whack at a lock with a weapon, treat the typical lock as having hardness 15 and
30 hit points. A lock can only be broken if it can be attacked separately from
the door, which means that a built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment.
In an occupied dungeon, every locked door should have a key somewhere. </p><p>A
special door (see below for examples) might have a lock with no key, instead
requiring that the right combination of nearby levers must be manipulated or
the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in the correct sequence to open
the door.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stuck
Doors: </span><span>Dungeons
are often damp, and sometimes doors get stuck, particularly wooden doors.
Assume that about 10% of wooden doors and 5% of nonwooden doors are stuck.
These numbers can be doubled (to 20% and 10%, respectively) for long-abandoned
or neglected dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Barred
Doors: </span><span>When
characters try to bash down a barred door, it’s the quality of the bar that matters,
not the material the door is made of. It takes a DC 25 Strength check to break
through a door with a wooden bar, and a DC 30 Strength check if the bar is made
of iron. Characters can attack the door and destroy it instead, leaving the bar
hanging in the now-open doorway.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Magic
Seals:</span><span> In
addition to magic traps spells such as <span style="font-style: italic;">arcane lock </span>can discourage
passage through a door. A door with an <span style="font-style: italic;">arcane lock </span>spell on it is
considered locked even if it doesn’t have a physical lock. It takes a <span style="font-style: italic;">knock </span>spell,
a <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic </span>spell, or a successful Strength check&nbsp; to get
through such a door.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Hinges:</span><span> Most doors have hinges.
Obviously, sliding doors do not. (They usually have tracks or grooves instead,
allowing them to slide easily to one side.)</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Standard
Hinges: </span><span>These
hinges are metal, joining one edge of the door to the doorframe or wall.
Remember that the door swings open toward the side with the hinges. (So, if the
hinges are on the PCs’ side, the door opens toward them; otherwise it opens
away from them.) Adventurers can take the hinges apart one at a time with
successful Disable Device checks (assuming the hinges are on their side of the
door, of course). Such a task has a DC of 20 because most hinges are rusted or
stuck. Breaking a hinge is difficult. Most have hardness 10 and 30 hit points.
The break DC for a hinge is the same as for breaking down the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Nested
Hinges: </span><span>These
hinges are much more complex than ordinary hinges, and are found only in areas
of excellent construction. These hinges are built into the wall and allow the
door to swing open in either direction. PCs can’t get at the hinges to fool
with them unless they break through the doorframe or wall. Nested hinges are
typically found on stone doors but sometimes on wooden or iron doors as well. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Pivots:
</span><span>Pivots
aren’t really hinges at all, but simple knobs jutting from the top and bottom
of the door that fit into holes in the doorframe, allowing the door to spin.
The advantages of pivots is that they can’t be dismantled like hinges and
they’re simple to make. The disadvantage is that since the door pivots on its
center of gravity (typically in the middle), nothing larger than half the
door’s width can fit through. Doors with pivots are usually stone and are often
quite wide to overcome this disadvantage. Another solution is to place the
pivot toward one side and have the door be thicker at that end and thinner
toward the other end so that it opens more like a normal door. Secret doors in
walls often turn on pivots, since the lack of hinges makes it easier to hide
the door’s presence. Pivots also allow objects such as bookcases to be used as
secret doors.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Secret
Doors:</span><span>
Disguised as a bare patch of wall (or floor, or ceiling), a bookcase, a
fireplace, or a fountain, a secret door leads to a secret passage or room.
Someone examining the area finds a secret door, if one exists, on a successful
Search check (DC 20 for a typical secret door to DC 30 for a well-hidden secret
door). Elves have a chance to detect a secret door just by casually looking at
an area.</span></p><p>Many
secret doors require a special method of opening, such as a hidden button or
pressure plate. Secret doors can open like normal doors, or they may pivot,
slide, sink, rise, or even lower like a drawbridge to permit access. Builders
might put a secret door down low near the floor or high up in a wall, making it
difficult to find or reach. Wizards and sorcerers have a spell, <span style="font-style: italic;">phase door</span>,
that allows them to create a magic secret door that only they can use.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Magic
Doors:</span><span>
Enchanted by the original builders, a door might speak to explorers, warning
them away. It might be protected from harm, increasing its hardness or giving
it more hit points as well as an improved saving throw bonus against <span style="font-style: italic;">disintegrate
</span>and other similar spells. A magic door might not lead into the space
revealed beyond, but instead it might be a portal to a faraway place or even
another plane of existence. Other magic doors might require passwords or
special keys to open them. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Portcullises:
</span><span>These
special doors consist of iron or thick, ironbound, wooden shafts that descend
from a recess in the ceiling above an archway. Sometimes a portcullis has
crossbars that create a grid, sometimes not. Typically raised by means of a
winch or a capstan, a portcullis can be dropped quickly, and the shafts end in
spikes to discourage anyone from standing underneath (or from attempting to
dive under it as it drops). Once it is dropped, a portcullis locks, unless it
is so large that no normal person could lift it anyway. In any event, lifting a
typical portcullis requires a DC 25 Strength check.</span></p></section><section id="h3-9-walls-doors-and-detect-spells"><h3>WALLS, DOORS, AND
DETECT SPELLS</h3><p>Stone
walls, iron walls, and iron doors are usually thick enough to block most <span style="font-style: italic;">detect
</span>spells, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">detect thoughts. </span>Wooden walls, wooden doors, and
stone doors are usually not thick enough to do so. However, a secret stone door
built into a wall and as thick as the wall itself (at least 1 foot) does block
most <span style="font-style: italic;">detect </span>spells.</p></section><section id="h3-10-rooms"><h3>ROOMS</h3><p>Rooms
in dungeons vary in shape and size. Although many are simple in construction
and appearance, particularly interesting rooms have multiple levels joined by
stairs, ramps, or ladders, as well as statuary, altars, pits, chasms, bridges,
and more.</p><p>Underground
chambers are prone to collapse, so many rooms— particularly large ones—have
arched ceilings or pillars to support the weight of the rock overhead.</p><p>Common
dungeon rooms fall into the following broad categories. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Guard
Post:</span><span>
Intelligent, social denizens of the dungeon will generally have a series of
adjacent rooms they consider “theirs,” and they’ll guard the entrances to that
common area. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Living
Quarters: </span><span>All
but the most nomadic creatures have a lair where they can rest, eat, and store
their treasure. Living quarters commonly include beds (if the creature sleeps),
possessions (both valuable and mundane), and some sort of food preparation
area. Noncombatant creatures such as juveniles and the elderly are often found
here.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Work
Area: </span><span>Most
intelligent creatures do more than just guard, eat, and sleep, and many devote
rooms to magic laboratories, workshops for weapons and armor, or studios for
more esoteric tasks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shrine:</span><span> Any creature that is
particularly religious may have some place dedicated to worship, and others may
venerate something of great historical or personal value. Depending on the
creature’s resources and piety, a shrine can be humble or extensive. A shrine
is where PCs will likely encounter NPC clerics, and it’s common for wounded monsters
to flee to a shrine friendly to them when they seek healing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Vault:</span><span> Well protected, often by
a locked iron door, a vault is a special room that contains treasure. There’s
usually only one entrance—an appropriate place for a trap.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Crypt:</span><span> Although sometimes
constructed like a vault, a crypt can also be a series of individual rooms,
each with its own sarcophagus, or a long hall with recesses on either
side—shelves to hold coffins or bodies.</span></p><p>Those
who are worried about undead rising from the grave take the precaution of
locking and trapping a crypt from the outside— making the crypt easy to get
into but difficult to leave. Those worried about tomb robbers make their crypts
difficult to get into. Some builders do both, just to be on the safe side.</p></section><section id="h3-11-corridors"><h3>CORRIDORS</h3><p>All
dungeons have rooms, and most have corridors. While most corridors simply
connect rooms, sometimes they can be encounter areas in their own right because
of traps, guard patrols, and wandering monsters out on the hunt.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Corridor
Traps:</span><span>
Because passageways in dungeons tend to be narrow, offering few movement
options, dungeon builders like to place traps in them. In a cramped passageway,
there’s no way for intruders to move around concealed pits, falling stones,
arrow traps, tilting floors, and sliding or rolling rocks that fill the entire
passage. For the same reason, magic traps such as <span style="font-style: italic;">glyphs of warding </span>are
effective in hallways as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Mazes:
</span><span>Usually,
passages connect chambers in the simplest and straightest manner possible. Some
dungeon builders, however, design a maze or a labyrinth within the dungeon.
This sort of construction is difficult to navigate (or at least to navigate
quickly) and, when filled with monsters or traps, can be an effective barrier.</span></p><p>A
maze can be used to cut off one area of the dungeon, deflecting intruders away
from a protected spot. Generally, though, the far side of a maze holds an
important crypt or vault—someplace that the dungeon’s regular inhabitants
rarely need to get to.</p></section><section id="h3-12-miscellaneous-features"><h3>MISCELLANEOUS
FEATURES</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stairs:</span><span> The usual way to connect
different levels of a dungeon is with stairs. Straight stairways, spiral
staircases, or stairwells with multiple landings between flights of stairs are
all common in dungeons, as are ramps (sometimes with an incline so slight that
it can be difficult to notice; Spot DC 15). Stairs are important accessways,
and are sometimes guarded or trapped. Traps on stairs often cause intruders to
slide or fall down to the bottom, where a pit, spikes, a pool of acid, or some
other danger awaits.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Gradual
Stairs: </span><span>Stairs
that rise less than 5 feet for every 5 feet of horizontal distance they cover
don’t affect movement, but characters who attack a foe below them gain a +1
bonus on attack rolls from being on higher ground. Most stairs in dungeons are
gradual, except for spiral stairs (see below).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Steep
Stairs: </span><span>Characters
moving up steep stairs (which rise at a 45- degree angle or steeper) must spend
2 squares of movement to enter each square of stairs. Characters running or
charging down steep stairs must succeed on a DC 10 Balance check upon entering
the first steep stairs square. Characters who fail stumble and must end their
movement 1d2×5 feet later. Characters who fail by 5 or more take 1d6 points of
damage and fall prone in the square where they end their movement. Steep stairs
increase the DC of Tumble checks by 5.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spiral
Stairs: </span><span>This
form of steep stairs is designed to make defending a fortress easier.
Characters gain cover against foes below them on spiral stairs because they can
easily duck around the staircase’s central support.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Railings
and Low Walls: </span><span>Stairs
that are open to large rooms often have railings or low walls. They function as
described for ledges (see Special Floors).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bridge:
</span><span>A bridge
connects two higher areas separated by a lower area, stretching across a chasm,
over a river, or above a pit. A simple bridge might be a single wooden plank,
while an elaborate one could be made of mortared stone with iron supports and
side rails.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Narrow
Bridge: </span><span>If
a bridge is particularly narrow, such as a series of planks laid over lava
fissures, treat it as a ledge (see Special Floors). It requires a Balance check
(DC dependent on width) to cross such a bridge.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Rope
Bridge: </span><span>Constructed
of wooden planks suspended from ropes, a rope bridge is convenient because it’s
portable and can be easily removed. It takes two full-round actions to untie
one end of a rope bridge, but a DC 15 Use Rope check reduces the time to a move
action. If only one of the two supporting ropes is attached, everyone on the
bridge must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid falling off, and thereafter
must make DC 15 Climb checks to move along the remnants of the bridge. Rope
bridges are usually 5 feet wide. The two ropes that support them have 8 hit
points each.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Drawbridge:
</span><span>Some
bridges have mechanisms that allow them to be extended or retracted from the
gap they cross. Typically,&nbsp; the winch mechanism exists on only one side of
the bridge. It takes a move action to lower a drawbridge, but the bridge
doesn’t come down until the beginning of the lowering character’s next turn. It
takes a full-round action to raise a drawbridge; the drawbridge is up at the
end of the action. Particularly long or wide drawbridges may take more time to
raise and lower, and some may require Strength checks to rotate the winch.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Railings
and Low Walls: </span><span>Some
bridges have railings or low walls along the sides. If a bridge does, the
railing or low walls affect Balance checks and bull rush attempts as described
for ledges (see Special Floors). Low walls likewise provide cover to bridge
occupants.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Chutes
and Chimneys:</span><span>
Stairs aren’t the only way to move up and down in a dungeon. Sometimes a
vertical shaft connects levels of a dungeon or links a dungeon with the
surface. Chutes are usually traps that dump characters into a lower area—often
a place featuring some dangerous situation with which they must contend.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pillar:</span><span> A common sight in any
dungeon, pillars and columns give support to ceilings. The larger the room, the
more likely it has pillars. As a rule of thumb, the deeper in the dungeon a
room is, the thicker the pillars need to be to support the overhead weight.
Pillars tend to be polished and often have carvings, paintings, or inscriptions
upon them. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Slender
Pillar: </span><span>These
pillars are only a foot or two across, so they don’t occupy a whole square. A
creature standing in the same square as a slender pillar gains a +2 cover bonus
to Armor Class and a +1 cover bonus on Reflex saves (these bonuses don’t stack
with cover bonuses from other sources). The presence of a slender pillar does
not otherwise affect a creature’s fighting space, because it’s assumed that the
creature is using the pillar to its advantage when it can. A typical slender
pillar has AC 4, hardness 8, and 250 hit points.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wide
Pillar: </span><span>These
pillars take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind them. They
have AC 3, hardness 8, and 900 hit points. A DC 20 Climb check is sufficient to
climb most pillars; the DC increases to 25 for polished or unusually slick
ones. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stalagmite/Stalactite:</span><span> These tapering natural
rock columns extend from the floor (stalagmite) or the ceiling (stalactite).
Stalagmites and stalactites function as slender pillars.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Statue:
</span><span>Most statues function as
wide pillars, taking up a square and providing cover. Some statues are smaller
and act as slender pillars. A DC 15 Climb check allows a character to climb a
statue. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Tapestry:</span><span> Elaborately embroidered
patterns or scenes on cloth, </span><span>tapestries
hang from the walls of well-appointed dungeon rooms or corridors. </span><span>Crafty builders take
advantage of tapestries to place alcoves, concealed doors, or secret switches
behind them.</span></p><p>Tapestries
provide total concealment (50% miss chance) to characters behind them if
they’re hanging from the ceiling, or concealment (20% miss chance) if they’re
flush with the wall. Climbing a big tapestry isn’t particularly difficult,
requiring a DC 15 Climb check (or DC 10 if a wall is within reach).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pedestal:</span><span> Anything important on
display in a dungeon, from a fabulous treasure to a coffin, tends to rest atop
a pedestal or a dais. Raising the object off the floor focuses attention on it
(and, in practical terms, keeps it safe from any water or other substance that
might seep onto the floor). A pedestal is often trapped to protect whatever
sits atop it. It can conceal a secret trapdoor beneath itself or provide a way
to reach a door in the ceiling above itself.</span></p><p>Only
the largest pedestals take up an entire square; most provide no cover.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pool:</span><span> Pools of water collect
naturally in low spots in dungeons (a dry dungeon is rare). Pools can also be
wells or natural underground springs, or they can be intentionally created
basins, cisterns, and fountains. In any event, water is fairly common in
dungeons, harboring sightless fish and sometimes aquatic monsters. Pools
provide water for dungeon denizens, and thus are as important an area for a
predator to control as a watering hole aboveground in the wild.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Shallow
Pool: </span><span>If
a square contains a shallow pool, it has roughly 1 foot of standing water. It
costs 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a shallow pool, and the
DC of Tumble checks in such squares increases by 2.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Deep
Pool: </span><span>These
squares have at least 4 feet of standing water. It costs Medium or larger
creatures 4 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep pool, or
characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller creatures must swim to move
through a square containing a deep pool. Tumbling is impossible in a deep pool.
The water in a deep pool provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller
creatures gain improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves).
Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved
cover. Creatures with this improved cover take a –10 penalty on attacks against
creatures that aren’t also underwater. </span></p><p>Deep
pool squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by a ring of shallow
pool squares. Both shallow pools and deep pools impose a –2 circumstance
penalty on Move Silently checks.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Special
Pools: </span><span>Through
accident or design, a pool can become magically enhanced. Rarely, a pool or a
fountain may be found that has the ability to bestow beneficial magic on those
who drink from it. However, magic pools are just as likely to curse the
drinker. Typically, water from a magic pool loses its potency if removed from
the pool for more than an hour or so.</span></p><p>Some
pools have fountains. Occasionally these are merely decorative, but they often
serve as the focus of a trap or the source of a pool’s magic.</p><p>Most
pools are made of water, but anything’s possible in a dungeon. Pools can hold
unsavory substances such as blood, poison, oil, or magma. And even if a pool
holds water, it can be holy water, saltwater, or water tainted with disease.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Elevator:
</span><span>In place
of or in addition to stairs, an elevator (essentially an oversized dumbwaiter)
can take inhabitants from one dungeon level to the next. Such an elevator may
be mechanical (using gears, pulleys, and winches) or magical (such as a <span style="font-style: italic;">levitate
</span>spell cast on a movable flat surface). A mechanical elevator might be as
small as a platform that holds one character at a time, or as large as an
entire room that raises and lowers. A clever builder might design an elevator
room that moves up or down without the occupants’ knowledge to catch them in a
trap, or one that appears to have moved when it actually remained still. </span></p><p>A
typical elevator ascends or descends 10 feet per round at the beginning of the
operator’s turn (or on initiative count 0 if it functions without regard to
whether creatures are on it. Elevators can be enclosed, can have railings or
low walls, or may simply be treacherous floating platforms.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ladders:</span><span> Whether free-standing or
rungs set into a wall, a ladder requires a DC 0 Climb check to ascend or
descend.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shifting
Stone or Wall: </span><span>These
features can cut off access to a passage or room, trapping adventurers in a
dead end or preventing escape out of the dungeon. Shifting walls can force
explorers to go down a dangerous path or prevent them from entering a special
area. Not all shifting walls need be traps. For example, stones controlled by
pressure plates, counterweights, or a secret lever can shift out of a wall to
become a staircase leading to a hidden upper room or secret ledge.</span></p><p>Shifting
stones and walls are generally constructed as traps with triggers and Search
and Disable Device DCs. However they don’t have Challenge Ratings because
they’re inconveniences, not deadly in and of themselves.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Teleporters:</span><span> Sometimes useful,
sometimes devious, places in a dungeon rigged with a teleportation effect (such
as a <span style="font-style: italic;">teleportation circle</span>) transport characters to some other location
in the dungeon or someplace far away. They can be traps, teleporting the unwary
into dangerous situations, or they can be an easy mode of transport for those
who built or live in the dungeon, good for bypassing barriers and traps or
simply to get around more quickly. Devious dungeon designers might place a
teleporter in a room that transports characters to another seemingly identical
room so that they don’t even know they’ve been teleported. A <span style="font-style: italic;">detect magic </span>spell
will provide a clue to the presence of a teleporter, but direct experimentation
or other research is the only way to discover where the teleporter leads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Altars:</span><span> Temples—particularly to
dark gods—often exist underground. Usually taking the form of a stone block, an
altar is the main fixture and central focus of such a temple. Sometimes all the
other trappings of the temple are long gone, lost to theft, age, and decay, but
the altar survives. Some altars have traps or powerful magic within them. Most
take up one or two squares on the grid and provide cover to creatures behind
them. </span></p></section><section id="h3-13-cave-ins-and-collapses-cr-8"><h3>CAVE-INS
AND COLLAPSES (CR 8)</h3><p>Cave-ins
and collapsing tunnels are extremely dangerous. Not only do dungeon explorers face
the danger of being crushed by tons of falling rock, even if they survive they
may be buried beneath a pile of rubble or cut off from the only known exit. A
cave-in buries anyone in the middle of the collapsing area, and then sliding
debris damages anyone in the periphery of the collapse. A typical corridor
subject to a cave-in might have a bury zone with a 15-foot radius and a
10-foot-radius slide zone extending beyond the bury zone. A weakened ceiling
can be spotted with a DC 20 Knowledge (architecture and engineering) or DC 20
Craft (stonemasonry) check. Remember that Craft checks can be made untrained as
Intelligence checks. A dwarf can make such a check if he simply passes within
10 feet of a weakened ceiling. </p><p>A
weakened ceiling may collapse when subjected to a major impact or concussion. A
character can cause a cave-in by destroying half the pillars holding the
ceiling up. </p><p>Characters
in the bury zone of a cave-in take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount if
they make a DC 15 Reflex save. They are subsequently buried. Characters in the
slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or no damage at all if they make a DC 15
Reflex save. Characters in the slide zone who fail their saves are buried.</p><p>Characters
take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried. If such a
character falls unconscious, he must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If it
fails, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed
or dead.</p><p>Characters
who aren’t buried can dig out their friends. In 1 minute, using only her hands,
a character can clear rocks and debris equal to five times her heavy load
limit. The amount of loose stone that fills a 5-foot-by-5-foot area weighs one
ton (2,000 pounds). Armed with an appropriate tool, such as a pick, crowbar, or
shovel, a digger can clear loose stone twice as quickly as by hand. You may
allow a buried character to free himself with a DC 25 Strength check.</p></section><section id="h3-14-slimes-molds-and-fungi"><h3>Slimes, Molds, and
Fungi</h3><p>In
a dungeon’s damp, dark recesses, molds and fungi thrive. While some plants and
fungi are monsters and other slime, mold, and fungus is just normal, innocuous
stuff, a few varieties are dangerous dungeon encounters. For purposes of spells
and other special effects, all slimes, molds, and fungi are treated as plants.
Like traps, dangerous slimes and molds have CRs, and characters earn XP for
encountering them.</p><p>A
form of glistening organic sludge coats almost anything that remains in the
damp and dark for too long. This kind of slime, though it might be repulsive,
is not dangerous.</p><p>Molds
and fungi flourish in dark, cool, damp places. While some are as inoffensive as
the normal dungeon slime, others are quite dangerous. Mushrooms, puffballs,
yeasts, mildew, and other sorts of bulbous, fibrous, or flat patches of fungi
can be found throughout most dungeons. They are usually inoffensive, and some
are even edible (though most are unappealing or odd-tasting).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Green
Slime (CR 4):</span><span>
This dungeon peril is a dangerous variety of normal slime. Green slime devours
flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of dissolving metal.
Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in
patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter. It drops from walls and
ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food) below.</span></p><p>A
single 5-foot square of green slime deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage per
round while it devours flesh. On the first round of contact, the slime can be
scraped off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but after
that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing damage to the victim as
well). Anything that deals cold or fire damage, sunlight, or a <span style="font-style: italic;">remove
disease </span>spell destroys a patch of green slime. Against wood or metal, green
slime deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignoring metal’s hardness but not
that of wood. It does not harm stone.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Yellow
Mold (CR 6): </span><span>If
disturbed, a 5-foot square of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous
spores. All within 10 feet of the mold must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take
1d6 points of Constitution damage. Another DC 15 Fortitude save is required 1
minute later—even by those who succeeded on the first save—to avoid taking 2d6
points of Constitution damage. Fire destroys yellow mold, and sunlight renders
it dormant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Brown
Mold (CR 2):</span><span>
Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. It normally
comes in patches 5 feet in diameter, and the temperature is always cold in a
30-foot radius around it. Living creatures within 5 feet of it take 3d6 points
of nonlethal cold damage. Fire brought within 5 feet of brown mold causes it to
instantly double in size. Cold damage, such as from a <span style="font-style: italic;">cone of cold, </span>instantly
destroys it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Phosphorescent
Fungus (No CR): </span><span>This
strange underground fungus grows in clumps that look almost like stunted
shrubbery. Drow elves cultivate it for food and light. It gives off a soft
violet glow that illuminates underground caverns and passages as well as a
candle does. Rare patches of fungus illuminate as well as a torch does.</span></p></section></section><section id="h2-15-wilderness"><h2>WILDERNESS</h2><section id="h3-16-getting-lost"><h3>GETTING LOST</h3><p>There
are many ways to get lost in the wilderness. Following an obvious road, trail,
or feature such as a stream or shoreline prevents any possibility of becoming
lost, but travelers striking off cross-country may become
disoriented—especially in conditions of poor visibility or in difficult
terrain. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Poor
Visibility:</span><span>
Any time characters cannot see at least 60 feet in the prevailing conditions of
visibility, they may become lost. Characters traveling through fog, snow, or a
downpour might easily lose the ability to see any landmarks not in their
immediate vicinity. Similarly, characters traveling at night may be at risk,
too, depending on the quality of their light sources, the amount of moonlight,
and whether they have darkvision or lowlight vision.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Difficult
Terrain:</span><span>
Any character in forest, moor, hill, or mountain terrain may become lost if he
or she moves away from a trail, road, stream, or other obvious path or track.
Forests are especially dangerous because they obscure far-off landmarks and
make it hard to see the sun or stars.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Chance
to Get Lost:</span><span>
If conditions exist that make getting lost a possibility, the character leading
the way must succeed on a Survival check or become lost. The difficulty of this
check varies based on the terrain, the visibility conditions, and whether or
not the character has a map of the area being traveled through. Refer to the
table below and use the highest DC that applies.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 31.6501em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;"></td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Survival DC</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;"></td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Survival DC</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Moor

pertaining to the area being traveled through gains a +2 bonus on this check.</p><p>Check
once per hour (or portion of an hour) spent in local or overland movement to
see if travelers have become lost. In the case of a party moving together, only
the character leading the way makes the check.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effects
of Being Lost:</span><span>
If a party becomes lost, it is no longer certain of moving in the direction it
intended to travel. Randomly determine the direction in which the party
actually travels during each hour of local or overland movement. The
characters’ movement continues to be random until they blunder into a landmark
they can’t miss, or until they recognize that they are lost and make an effort
to regain their bearings.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Recognizing
that You’re Lost:</span><span> Once per hour of random travel, each character in the party
may attempt a Survival check (DC 20, –1 per hour of random travel) to recognize
that they are no longer certain of their direction of travel. Some
circumstances may make it obvious that the characters are lost.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Setting
a New Course: </span><span>A
lost party is also uncertain of determining in which direction it should travel
in order to reach a desired objective. Determining the correct direction of
travel once a party has become lost requires a Survival check (DC 15, +2 per
hour of random travel). If a character fails this check, he chooses a random
direction as the “correct” direction for resuming travel.</span></p><p>Once
the characters are traveling along their new course, correct or incorrect, they
may get lost again. If the conditions still make it possible for travelers to
become lost, check once per hour of travel as described in Chance to Get Lost,
above, to see if the party maintains its new course or begins to move at random
again.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Conflicting
Directions: </span><span>It’s
possible that several characters may attempt to determine the right direction
to proceed after becoming lost. Make a Survival check for each character in
secret, then tell the players whose characters succeeded the correct direction
in which to travel, and tell the players whose characters failed a random
direction they think is right. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Regaining
Your Bearings:</span><span>
There are several ways to become un-lost. First, if the characters successfully
set a new course and follow it to the destination they’re trying to reach,
they’re not lost anymore. Second, the characters through random movement might
run into an unmistakable landmark. Third, if conditions suddenly improve—the
fog lifts or the sun comes up—lost characters may attempt to set a new course,
as described above, with a +4 bonus on the Survival check. Finally, magic may
make their course clear.</span></p></section><section id="h3-17-forest-terrain"><h3>FOREST TERRAIN</h3><p>Forest

</span><span>The most
important terrain element in a forest is the trees, obviously. A creature
standing in the same square as a tree gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +1
bonus on Reflex saves (these bonuses don’t stack with cover bonuses from other
sources). The presence of a tree doesn’t otherwise affect a creature’s fighting
space, because it’s assumed that the creature is using the tree to its
advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has AC 4, hardness 5, and
150 hp. A DC 15 Climb check is sufficient to climb a tree. Medium and dense
forests have massive trees as well. These trees take up an entire square and
provide cover to anyone behind them. They have AC 3, hardness 5, and 600 hp.
Like their smaller counterparts, it takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Undergrowth:</span><span> Vines, roots, and short
bushes cover much of the ground in a forest. A space covered with light
undergrowth costs 2 squares of movement to move into, and it provides
concealment. Undergrowth increases the DC of Tumble and Move Silently checks by
2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy undergrowth costs 4
squares of movement to move into, and it provides concealment with a 30% miss
chance (instead of the usual 20%). It increases the DC of Tumble and Move
Silently checks by 5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5
circumstance bonus on Hide checks. Running and charging are impossible. Squares
with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees aren’t
mutually exclusive; it’s common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and
undergrowth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Forest
Canopy:</span><span>
It’s common for elves and other forest dwellers to live on raised platforms far
above the surface floor. These wooden platforms generally have rope bridges
between them. To get to the treehouses, characters generally ascend the trees’
branches (Climb DC 15), use rope ladders (Climb DC 0), or take pulley elevators
(which can be made to rise a number of feet equal to a Strength check, made
each round as a full-round action). Creatures on platforms or branches in a
forest canopy are considered to have cover when fighting creatures on the
ground, and in medium or dense forests they have concealment as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Other
Forest Terrain Elements: </span><span>Fallen logs generally stand about 3 feet high and provide
cover just as low walls do. They cost 5 feet of movement to cross. Forest
streams are generally 5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep. Pathways
wind through most forests, allowing normal movement and providing neither cover
nor concealment. These paths are less common in dense forests, but even
unexplored forests will have occasional game trails.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stealth
and Detection in a Forest:</span><span> In a sparse forest, the maximum distance at which a Spot
check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 3d6×10 feet.
In a medium forest, this distance is 2d8×10 feet, and in a dense forest it is
2d6×10 feet.</span></p><p>Because
any square with undergrowth provides concealment, it’s usually easy for a
creature to use the Hide skill in the forest. Logs and massive trees provide
cover, which also makes hiding possible.</p><p>The
background noise in the forest makes Listen checks more difficult, increasing
the DC of the check by 2 per 10 feet, not 1 (but note that Move Silently is
also more difficult in undergrowth). </p></section><section id="h4-19-forest-fires-cr-6"><h4>Forest
Fires (CR 6)</h4><p>Most
campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are dry, winds are strong, or
the forest floor is dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result.
Lightning strikes often set trees afire and start forest fires in this way.
Whatever the cause of the fire, travelers can get caught in the conflagration.</p><p>A
forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6×100 feet by a character who
makes a Spot check, treating the fire as a Colossal creature (reducing the DC
by 16). If all characters fail their Spot checks, the fire moves closer to
them. They automatically see it when it closes to half the original distance.</p><p>Characters
who are blinded or otherwise unable to make Spot checks can feel the heat of
the fire (and thus automatically “spot” it) when it is 100 feet away.</p><p>The
leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can
run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of moderate strength). Once a
particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it remains so for 2d4×10 minutes
before dying to a smoking smolder. Characters overtaken by a forest fire may
find the leading edge of the fire advancing away from them faster than they can
keep up, trapping them deeper and deeper in its grasp.</p><p>Within
the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage,
catching on fire, and smoke inhalation. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Heat
Damage:</span><span>
Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to extreme
heat (see Heat Dangers). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6
points of damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a
Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points
of nonlethal damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the lethal
damage, but not the nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort
of armor take a –4 penalty on their saving throws. In addition, those wearing
metal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a <span style="font-style: italic;">heat
metal </span>spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Catching
on Fire:</span><span>
Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire when the
leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and are then at risk once per minute
thereafter (see Catching on Fire)<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Smoke
Inhalation:</span><span>
Forest fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes
heavy smoke must make a Fortitude save each round (DC 15, +1 per previous
check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2
consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Also, smoke obscures
vision, providing concealment to characters within it.</span></p></section></section><section id="h3-20-marsh-terrain"><h3>MARSH TERRAIN</h3><p>Two

shallow bog, it has deep mud or standing water of about 1 foot in depth. It
costs 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a shallow bog, and the
DC of Tumble checks in such a square increases by 2. </span></p><p>A
square that is part of a deep bog has roughly 4 feet of standing water. It
costs Medium or larger creatures 4 squares of movement to move into a square
with a deep bog, or characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller
creatures must swim to move through a deep bog. Tumbling is impossible in a
deep bog.</p><p>The
water in a deep bog provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller
creatures gain improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves).
Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved
cover. Creatures with this improved cover take a –10 penalty on attacks against
creatures that aren’t underwater.</p><p>Deep
bog squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by an irregular ring
of shallow bog squares.</p><p>Both
shallow and deep bogs increase the DC of Move Silently checks by 2.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Undergrowth:</span><span> The bushes, rushes, and
other tall grasses in marshes function as undergrowth does in a forest (see
above). A square that is part of a bog does not also have undergrowth. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Quicksand:</span><span> Patches of quicksand
present a deceptively solid appearance (appearing as undergrowth or open land)
that may trap careless characters. A character approaching a patch of quicksand
at a normal pace is entitled to a DC 8 Survival check to spot the danger before
stepping in, but charging or running characters don’t have a chance to detect a
hidden bog before blundering in. A typical patch of quicksand is 20 feet in
diameter; the momentum of a charging or running character carries him or her
1d2×5 feet into the quicksand.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Effects
of Quicksand: </span><span>Characters
in quicksand must make a DC 10 Swim check every round to simply tread water in
place, or a DC 15 Swim check to move 5 feet in whatever direction is desired.
If a trapped character fails this check by 5 or more, he sinks below the
surface and begins to drown whenever he can no longer hold his breath (see the
Swim skill description)<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></span></p><p>Characters
below the surface of a bog may swim back to the surface with a successful Swim
check (DC 15, +1 per consecutive round of being under the surface).</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Rescue:
</span><span>Pulling
out a character trapped in quicksand can be difficult. A rescuer needs a
branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim
with one end of it. Then he must make a DC 15 Strength check to successfully pull
the victim, and the victim must make a DC 10 Strength check to hold onto the
branch, pole, or rope. If the victim fails to hold on, he must make a DC 15
Swim check immediately to stay above the surface. If both checks succeed, the
victim is pulled 5 feet closer to safety.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Hedgerows:</span><span> Common in moors,
hedgerows are tangles of stones, soil, and thorny bushes. Narrow hedgerows
function as low walls, and it takes 15 feet of movement to cross them. Wide
hedgerows are more than 5 feet tall and take up entire squares. They provide
total cover, just as a wall does. It takes 4 squares of movement to move
through a square with a wide hedgerow; creatures that succeed on a DC 10 Climb
check need only 2 squares of movement to move through the square.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Other
Marsh Terrain Elements:</span><span> Some marshes, particularly swamps, have trees just as
forests do, usually clustered in small stands. Paths lead across many marshes,
winding to avoid bog areas. As in forests, paths allow normal movement and
don’t provide the concealment that undergrowth does.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stealth
and Detection in a Marsh:</span><span> In a moor, the maximum distance at which a Spot check for
detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6×10 feet. In a swamp,
this distance is 2d8×10 feet.</span></p><p>Undergrowth
and deep bogs provide plentiful concealment, so it’s easy to hide in a marsh.</p><p>A
marsh imposes no penalties on Listen checks, and using the Move Silently skill
is more difficult in both undergrowth and bogs.</p></section></section><section id="h3-22-hills-terrain"><h3>HILLS TERRAIN</h3><p>A

Slope:</span><span>
This incline isn’t steep enough to affect movement, but characters gain a +1
bonus on melee attacks against foes downhill from them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Steep
Slope:</span><span>
Characters moving uphill (to an adjacent square of higher elevation) must spend
2 squares of movement to enter each square of steep slope. Characters running
or charging downhill (moving to an adjacent square of lower elevation) must
succeed on a DC 10 Balance check upon entering the first steep slope square.
Mounted characters make a DC 10 Ride check instead. Characters who fail this
check stumble and must end their movement 1d2×5 feet later. Characters who fail
by 5 or more fall prone in the square where they end their movement. A steep
slope increases the DC of Tumble checks by 2.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cliff:</span><span> A cliff typically
requires a DC 15 Climb check to scale and is 1d4×10 feet tall, although the
needs of your map may mandate a taller cliff. A cliff isn’t perfectly vertical,
taking up 5-foot squares if it’s less than 30 feet tall and 10-foot squares if
it’s 30 feet or taller. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Light
Undergrowth:</span><span>
Sagebrush and other scrubby bushes grow on hills, athough they rarely cover the
landscape as they do in forests and marshes. Light undergrowth provides
concealment and increases the DC of Tumble and Move Silently checks by 2. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Other
Hills Terrain Elements:</span><span> Trees aren’t out of place in hills terrain, and valleys
often have active streams (5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep) or
dry streambeds (treat as a trench 5 to 10 feet across) in them. If you add a
stream or streambed, remember that water always flows downhill.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stealth
and Detection in Hills:</span><span> In gentle hills, the maximum distance at which a Spot check
for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 2d10×10 feet. In
rugged hills, this distance is 2d6×10 feet.</span></p><p>Hiding
in hills terrain can be difficult if there isn’t undergrowth around. A hilltop
or ridge provides enough cover to hide from anyone below the hilltop or ridge.</p><p>Hills

and Steep Slopes:</span><span> These function as described in Hills Terrain, above.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cliff:
</span><span>These
terrain elements also function like their hills terrain counterparts, but
they’re typically 2d6×10 feet tall. Cliffs taller than 80 feet take up 20 feet
of horizontal space.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Chasm:
</span><span>Usually formed
by natural geological processes, chasms function like pits in a dungeon
setting. Chasms aren’t hidden, so characters won’t fall into them by accident
(although bull rushes are another story). A typical chasm is 2d4×10 feet deep,
at least 20 feet long, and anywhere from 5 feet to 20 feet wide. It takes a DC
15 Climb check to climb out of a chasm. In forbidding mountain terrain, chasms
are typically 2d8×10 feet deep.</span></p><p>Light
Undergrowth: This functions as described in Forest Terrain,</p><p>above.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Scree:</span><span> A field of shifting
gravel, scree doesn’t affect speed, but it can be treacherous on a slope. The
DC of Balance and Tumble checks increases by 2 if there’s scree on a gradual
slope and by 5 if there’s scree on a steep slope. The DC of Move silently
checks increases by 2 if the scree is on a slope of any kind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dense
Rubble: </span><span>The
ground is covered with rocks of all sizes. It costs 2 squares of movement to
enter a square with dense rubble. The DC of Balance and Tumble checks on dense
rubble increases by 5, and the DC of Move Silently checks increases by +2. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rock
Wall:</span><span> A
vertical plane of stone, rock walls require DC 25 Climb checks to ascend. A
typical rock wall is 2d4×10 feet tall in rugged mountains and 2d8×10 feet tall
in forbidding mountains. Rock walls are drawn on the edges of squares, not in
the squares themselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cave
Entrance:</span><span>
Found in cliff and steep slope squares and next to rock walls, cave entrances
are typically between 5 and 20 feet wide and 5 feet deep. Beyond the entrance,
a cave could be anything from a simple chamber to the entrance to an elaborate
dungeon. Caves used as monster lairs typically have 1d3 rooms that are 1d4×10
feet across. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Other
Mountain Terrain Features:</span><span> Most alpine meadows begin above the tree line, so trees and
other forest elements are rare in the mountains. Mountain terrain can include
active streams (5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep) and dry
streambeds (treat as a trench 5 to 10 feet across). Particularly high-altitude
areas tend to be colder than the lowland areas that surround them, so they may
be covered in ice sheets (described below).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stealth
and Detection in Mountains:</span><span> As a guideline, the maximum distance in mountain terrain at
which a Spot check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is
4d10×10 feet. Certain peaks and ridgelines afford much better vantage points,
of course, and twisting valleys and canyons have much shorter spotting
distances. Because there’s little vegetation to obstruct line of sight, the
specifics on your map are your best guide for the range at which an encounter
could begin. As in hills terrain, a ridge or peak provides enough cover to hide
from anyone below the high point.</span></p><p>It’s
easier to hear faraway sounds in the mountains. The DC of Listen checks
increases by 1 per 20 feet between listener and source, not per 10 feet.</p></section><section id="h4-26-avalanches-cr-7"><h4>Avalanches
(CR 7)</h4><p>The
combination of high peaks and heavy snowfalls means that avalanches are a
deadly peril in many mountainous areas. While avalanches of snow and ice are
common, it’s also possible to have an avalanche of rock and soil.</p><p>An
avalanche can be spotted from as far away as 1d10×500 feet downslope by a
character who makes a DC 20 Spot check, treating the avalanche as a Colossal
creature. If all characters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter
distance, the avalanche moves closer to them, and they automatically become
aware of it when it closes to half the original distance. It’s possible to hear
an avalanche coming even if you can’t see it. Under optimum conditions (no
other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a DC 15 Listen check can
hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6×500 feet away. This check might
have a DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such
as in the middle of a thunderstorm). </p><p>A
landslide or avalanche consists of two distinct areas: the bury zone (in the
direct path of the falling debris) and the slide zone (the area the debris
spreads out to encompass). Characters in the bury zone always take damage from
the avalanche; characters in the slide zone may be able to get out of the way.
Characters in the bury zone take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount if
they make a DC 15 Reflex save. They are subsequently buried (see below).
Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or no damage if they
make a DC 15 Reflex save. Those who fail their saves are buried. </p><p>Buried
characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute. If a buried
character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or
take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p><p>The
typical avalanche has a width of 1d6×100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone
to the opposite edge. The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half as
wide as the avalanche’s full width.</p><p>To
determine the precise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll
1d6×20; the result is the number of feet from the center of the path taken by
the bury zone to the center of the party’s location. Avalanches of snow and ice
advance at a speed of 500 feet per round, and rock avalanches travel at a speed
of 250 feet per round.</p></section><section id="h4-27-mountain-travel"><h4>Mountain Travel</h4><p>High
altitude can be extremely fatiguing—or sometimes deadly—to creatures that aren’t
used to it. Cold becomes extreme, and the lack of oxygen in the air can wear
down even the most hardy of warriors.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Acclimated
Characters:</span><span>
Creatures accustomed to high altitude generally fare better than lowlanders.
Any creature with an Environment entry that includes mountains is considered
native to the area, and acclimated to the high altitude. Characters can also
acclimate themselves by living at high altitude for a month. Characters who
spend more than two months away from the mountains must reacclimate themselves
when they return. Undead, constructs, and other creatures that do not breathe
are immune to altitude effects.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Altitude
Zones: </span><span>In
general, mountains present three possible altitude bands: low pass, low
peak/high pass, and high peak. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Low
Pass (lower than 5,000 feet): </span><span>Most travel in low mountains takes place in low
passes, a zone consisting largely of alpine meadows and forests. Travelers may
find the going difficult (which is reflected in the movement modifiers for
traveling through mountains), but the altitude itself has no game effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Low
Peak or High Pass (5,000 to 15,000 feet): </span><span>Ascending to the highest slopes of
low mountains, or most normal travel through high mountains, falls into this
category. All nonacclimated creatures labor to breathe in the thin air at this
altitude. Characters must succeed on a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per
previous check) or be fatigued. The fatigue ends when the character descends to
an altitude with more air. Acclimated characters do not have to attempt the
Fortitude save. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">High
Peak (more than 15,000 feet): </span><span>The highest mountains exceed 20,000 feet in height. At
these elevations, creatures are subject to both high altitude fatigue (as
described above) and altitude sickness, whether or not they’re acclimated to
high altitudes<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>Altitude sickness represents long-term oxygen
deprivation, and it affects mental and physical ability scores. After each
6-hour period a character spends at an altitude of over 15,000 feet, he must
succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1 point of
damage to all ability scores. Creatures acclimated to high altitude receive a
+4 competence bonus on their saving throws to resist high altitude effects and
altitude sickness, but eventually even seasoned mountaineers must abandon these
dangerous elevations. </span></p></section></section><section id="h3-28-desert-terrain"><h3>DESERT TERRAIN</h3><p>Desert
terrain exists in warm, temperate, and cold climates, but all deserts share one
common trait: little rain. The three categories of desert terrain are tundra
(cold deserts), rocky desert (often temperate), and sandy desert (often warm).</p><p>Tundra
differs from the other desert categories in two important ways. Because snow
and ice cover much of the landscape, it’s easy to find water. And during the
height of summer, the permafrost thaws to a depth of a foot or so, turning the
landscape into a vast field of mud. The muddy tundra affects movement and skill
use as the shallow bogs described in marsh terrain, although there’s little
standing water.</p><p>The
table above describes terrain elements found in each of the three desert
categories. The terrain elements on this table are mutually exclusive; for
instance, a square of tundra may contain either light undergrowth or an ice
sheet, but not both.</p><section id="h4-29-desert-terrain-features"><h4>Desert

Sheet: </span><span>The
ground is covered with slippery ice. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a

Small rocks are strewn across the ground, making nimble movement more difficult
more difficult. The DC of Balance and Tumble checks increases by 2. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dense
Rubble:</span><span>
This terrain feature consists of more and larger stones. It costs 2 squares of
movement to enter a square with dense rubble. The DC of Balance and Tumble

Dunes:</span><span>
Created by the action of wind on sand, sand dunes function as hills that move.
If the wind is strong and consistent, a sand dune can move several hundred feet
in a week’s time. Sand dunes can cover hundreds of squares. They always have a
gentle slope pointing in the direction of the prevailing wind and a steep slope
on the leeward side.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Other
Desert Terrain Features:</span><span> Tundra is sometimes bordered by forests, and the occasional
tree isn’t out of place in the cold wastes. Rocky deserts have towers and mesas
consisting of flat ground surrounded on all sides by cliffs and steep slopes
(described in Mountain Terrain, above). Sandy deserts sometimes have quicksand;
this functions as described in Marsh Terrain, above, although desert quicksand
is a waterless mixture of fine sand and dust. All desert terrain is
crisscrossed with dry streambeds (treat as trenches 5 to 15 feet wide) that
fill with water on the rare occasions when rain falls.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stealth
and Detection in the Desert:</span><span> In general, the maximum distance in desert terrain at which
a Spot check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6×20
feet; beyond this distance, elevation changes and heat distortion in warm
deserts makes spotting impossible. The presence of dunes in sandy deserts
limits spotting distance to 6d6×10 feet. </span></p><p>The
desert imposes neither bonuses nor penalties on Listen or Spot checks. The
scarcity of undergrowth or other elements that offer concealment or cover makes
hiding more difficult.</p></section><section id="h4-30-sandstorms"><h4>Sandstorms</h4><p>A
sandstorm reduces visibility to 1d10×5 feet and provides a –4 penalty on
Listen, Search, and Spot checks. A sandstorm deals 1d3 points of nonlethal
damage per hour to any creatures caught in the open, and leaves a thin coating
of sand in its wake. Driving sand creeps in through all but the most secure
seals and seams, to chafe skin and contaminate carried gear. </p></section></section><section id="h3-31-plains-terrain"><h3>PLAINS TERRAIN</h3><p>Plains
come in three categories: farms, grasslands, and battlefields. Farms are common
in settled areas, of course, while grasslands represent untamed plains. The
battlefields where large armies clash are temporary places, usually reclaimed
by natural vegetation or the farmer’s plow. Battlefields represent a third
terrain category because adventurers tend to spend a lot of time there, not because
they’re particularly prevalent.</p><p>The
table below shows the proportions of terrain elements in the different
categories of plains. On a farm, light undergrowth represents most mature grain
crops, so farms growing vegetable crops will have less light undergrowth, as

no cover against adjacent foes. It costs 2 squares of movement to leave a
trench, but it costs nothing extra to enter one. Creatures outside a trench who
make a melee attack against a creature inside the trench gain a +1 bonus on
melee attacks because they have higher ground. In farm terrain, trenches are
generally irrigation ditches.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Berm:
</span><span>A common
defensive structure, a berm is a low, earthen wall that slows movement and
provides a measure of cover. Put a berm on the map by drawing two adjacent rows
of steep slope (described in Hills Terrain, above), with the edges of the berm
on the downhill side. Thus, a character crossing a two-square berm will travel
uphill for 1 square, then downhill for 1 square. Two square berms provide cover
as low walls for anyone standing behind them. Larger berms provide the low wall
benefit for anyone standing 1 square downhill from the top of the berm. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fences:</span><span> Wooden fences are
generally used to contain livestock or impede oncoming soldiers. It costs an
extra square of movement to cross a wooden fence. A stone fence provides a
measure of cover as well, functioning as low walls. Mounted characters can
cross a fence without slowing their movement if they succeed on a DC 15 Ride
check. If the check fails, the steed crosses the fence, but the rider falls out
of the saddle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Other
Plains Terrain Features:</span><span> Occasional trees dot the landscape in many plains, although
on battlefields they’re often felled to provide raw material for siege engines
(described in Urban Features). Hedgerows (described in Marsh Terrain) are found
in plains as well. Streams, generally 5 to 20 feet wide and 5 to 10 feet deep,
are commonplace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stealth
and Detection in Plains:</span><span> In plains terrain, the maximum distance at which a Spot
check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6×40 feet,
although the specifics of your map may restrict line of sight. Plains terrain
provides no bonuses or penalties on Listen and Spot checks. Cover and
concealment are not uncommon, so a good place of refuge is often nearby, if not
right at hand.</span></p></section></section><section id="h3-33-aquatic-terrain"><h3>AQUATIC TERRAIN</h3><p>Aquatic
terrain is the least hospitable to most PCs, because they can’t breathe there.
Aquatic terrain doesn’t offer the variety that land terrain does. The ocean
floor holds many marvels, including undersea analogues of any of the terrain
elements described earlier in this section. But if characters find themselves
in the water because they were bull rushed off the deck of a pirate ship, the
tall kelp beds hundreds of feet below them don’t matter. Accordingly, these
rules simply divide aquatic terrain into two categories: flowing water (such as
streams and rivers) and nonflowing water (such as lakes and oceans).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Flowing
Water:</span><span>
Large, placid rivers move at only a few miles per hour, so they function as
still water for most purposes. But some rivers and streams are swifter;
anything floating in them moves downstream at a speed of 10 to 40 feet per
round. The fastest rapids send swimmers bobbing downstream at 60 to 90 feet per
round. Fast rivers are always at least rough water (Swim DC 15), and whitewater
rapids are stormy water (Swim DC 20). If a character is in moving water, move
her downstream the indicated distance at the end of her turn. A character
trying to maintain her position relative to the riverbank can spend some or all
of her turn swimming upstream.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Swept
Away: </span><span>Characters
swept away by a river moving 60 feet per round or faster must make DC 20 Swim
checks every round to avoid going under. If a character gets a check result of
5 or more over the minimum necessary, he arrests his motion by catching a rock,
tree limb, or bottom snag—he is no longer being carried along by the flow of
the water. Escaping the rapids by reaching the bank requires three DC 20 Swim checks
in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can’t escape under their
own power unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way
clear. Other characters can rescue them as if they were trapped in quicksand
(described in Marsh Terrain, above). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Nonflowing
Water:</span><span>
Lakes and oceans simply require a swim speed or successful Swim checks to move
through (DC 10 in calm water, DC 15 in rough water, DC 20 in stormy water).
Characters need a way to breathe if they’re underwater; failing that, they risk
drowning. When underwater, characters can move in any direction as if they were
flying with perfect maneuverability.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Stealth
and Detection Underwater: </span><span>How far you can see underwater depends on the water’s
clarity. As a guideline, creatures can see 4d8×10 feet if the water is clear,
and 1d8×10 feet if it’s murky. Moving water is always murky, unless it’s in a
particularly large, slow-moving river.</span></p><p>It’s
hard to find cover or concealment to hide underwater (except along the
seafloor). Listen and Move Silently checks function normally underwater.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Invisibility:
</span><span>An
invisible creature displaces water and leaves a visible, body-shaped “bubble”
where the water was displaced. The creature still has concealment (20% miss
chance), but not total concealment (50% miss chance).</span></p><section id="h4-34-underwater-combat"><h4>Underwater Combat</h4><p>Land-based
creatures can have considerable difficulty when fighting in water. Water
affects a creature’s Armor Class, attack rolls, damage, and movement. In some
cases a creature’s opponents may get a bonus on attacks. The effects are
summarized in the accompanying table. They apply whenever a character is
swimming, walking in chestdeep water, or walking along the bottom. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ranged
Attacks Underwater:</span><span> Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when
launched from land. Attacks with other ranged weapons take a –2 penalty on
attack rolls for every 5 feet of water they pass through, in addition to the
normal penalties for range. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Attacks
from Land:</span><span>
Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or wading in
water at least chest deep, have improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on
Reflex saves) from opponents on land. Landbound opponents who have <span style="font-style: italic;">freedom
of movement </span>effects ignore this cover when making melee attacks against
targets in the water. A completely submerged creature has total cover against
opponents on land unless those opponents have <span style="font-style: italic;">freedom of movement </span>effects.
Magical effects are unaffected except for those that require attack rolls
(which are treated like any other effects) and fire effects.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fire:</span><span> Nonmagical fire
(including alchemist’s fire) does not burn underwater. Spells or spell-like
effects with the fire descriptor are ineffective underwater unless the caster
makes a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the
spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, but
otherwise the spell works as described. A supernatural fire effect is
ineffective underwater unless its description states otherwise. The surface of
a body of water blocks line of effect for any fire spell. If the caster has
made a Spellcraft check to make the fire spell usable underwater, the surface
still blocks the spell’s line of effect.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 59.3251em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="5" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table: Combat Adjustments

many wilderness areas, river floods are a common occurrence.</p><p>In
spring, an enormous snowmelt can engorge the streams and rivers it feeds. Other
catastrophic events such as massive rainstorms or the destruction of a dam can
create floods as well.</p><p>During
a flood, rivers become wider, deeper, and swifter. Assume that a river rises by
1d10+10 feet during the spring flood, and its width increases by a factor of
1d4×50%. Fords may disappear for days, bridges may be swept away, and even
ferries might not be able to manage the crossing of a flooded river. A river in
flood makes Swim checks one category harder (calm water becomes rough, and
rough water becomes stormy). Rivers also become 50% swifter.</p></section></section><section id="h3-36-urban-adventures"><h3>URBAN ADVENTURES</h3><p>At
first glance, a city is much like a dungeon, made up of walls, doors, rooms,
and corridors. Adventures that take place in cities have two salient
differences from their dungeon counterparts, however. Characters have greater
access to resources, and they must contend with law enforcement.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Access
to Resources:</span><span>
Unlike in dungeons and the wilderness, characters can buy and sell gear quickly
in a city. A large city or metropolis probably has high-level NPCs and experts
in obscure fields of knowledge who can provide assistance and decipher clues.
And when the PCs are battered and bruised, they can retreat to the comfort of a
room at the inn.</span></p><p>The freedom to
retreat and ready access to the marketplace means that the players have a
greater degree of control over the pacing of an urban adventure.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;Law
Enforcement:</span><span>
The other key distinctions between adventuring in a city and delving into a
dungeon is that a dungeon is, almost by definition, a lawless place where the
only law is that of the jungle: Kill or be killed. A city, on the other hand,
is held together by a code of laws, many of which are explicitly designed to
prevent the sort of behavior that adventurers engage in all the time: killing
and looting. Even so, most cities’ laws recognize monsters as a threat to the
stability the city relies on, and prohibitions about murder rarely apply to
monsters such as aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however,
are typically protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens of the
city. Having an evil alignment is not a crime (except in some severely
theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up the law); only
evil deeds are against the law. Even when adventurers encounter an evildoer in
the act of perpetrating some heinous evil upon the populace of the city, the
law tends to frown on the sort of vigilante justice that leaves the evildoer
dead or otherwise unable to testify at a trial.</span></p><section id="h4-37-weapon-and-spell-restrictions"><h4>Weapon And Spell Restrictions</h4><p>Different
cities have different laws about such issues as carrying weapons in public and
restricting spellcasters.</p><p>The
city’s laws may not affect all characters equally. A monk isn’t hampered at all
by a law about peace-bonding weapons, but a cleric is reduced to a fraction of
his power if all holy symbols are confiscated at the city’s gates.</p></section><section id="h4-38-urban-features"><h4>Urban Features</h4><p>Walls,
doors, poor lighting, and uneven footing: In many ways a city is much like a
dungeon. Some new considerations for an urban setting are covered below.</p></section><section id="h4-39-walls-and-gates"><h4>Walls and Gates</h4><p>Many
cities are surrounded by walls. A typical small city wall is a fortified stone
wall 5 feet thick and 20 feet high. Such a wall is fairly smooth, requiring a
DC 30 Climb check to scale. The walls are crenellated on one side to provide a
low wall for the guards atop it, and there is just barely room for guards to
walk along the top of the wall. A typical small city wall has AC 3, hardness 8,
and 450 hp per 10-foot section.</p><p>A
typical large city wall is 10 feet thick and 30 feet high, with crenellations
on both sides for the guards on top of the wall. It is likewise smooth,
requiring a DC 30 Climb check to scale. Such a wall has AC 3, hardness 8, and
720 hp per 10-foot section.</p><p>A
typical metropolis wall is 15 feet thick and 40 feet tall. It has crenellations
on both sides and often has a tunnel and small rooms running through its
interior. Metropolis walls have AC 3, hardness 8, and 1,170 hp per 10- foot
section.</p><p>Unlike
smaller cities, metropolises often have interior walls as well as surrounding
walls—either old walls that the city has outgrown, or walls dividing individual
districts from each other. Sometimes these walls are as large and thick as the
outer walls, but more often they have the characteristics of a large city’s or
small city’s walls.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Watch
Towers:</span><span>
Some city walls are adorned with watch towers set at irregular intervals. Few
cities have enough guards to keep someone constantly stationed at every tower,
unless the city is expecting attack from outside. The towers provide a superior
view of the surrounding countryside as well as a point of defense against
invaders.</span></p><p>Watch
towers are typically 10 feet higher than the wall they adjoin, and their
diameter is 5 times the thickness of the wall. Arrow slits line the outer sides
of the upper stories of a tower, and the top is crenellated like the surrounding
walls are. In a small tower (25 feet in diameter adjoining a 5-foot-thick
wall), a simple ladder typically connect the tower’s stories and the roof. In a
larger tower, stairs serve that purpose. </p><p>Heavy
wooden doors, reinforced with iron and bearing good locks (Open Lock DC 30),
block entry to a tower, unless the tower is in regular use. As a rule, the
captain of the guard keeps the key to the tower secured on her person, and a
second copy is in the city’s inner fortress or barracks.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Gates:</span><span> A typical city gate is a
gatehouse with two portcullises and murder holes above the space between them.
In towns and some small cities, the primary entry is through iron double doors
set into the city wall.</span></p><p>Gates
are usually open during the day and locked or barred at night. Usually, one
gate lets in travelers after sunset and is staffed by guards who will open it
for someone who seems honest, presents proper papers, or offers a large enough
bribe (depending on the city and the guards).</p></section><section id="h4-40-guards-and-soldiers"><h4>Guards and Soldiers</h4><p>A
city typically has full-time military personnel equal to 1% of its adult
population, in addition to militia or conscript soldiers equal to 5% of the
population. The full-time soldiers are city guards responsible for maintaining
order within the city, similar to the role of modern police, and (to a lesser
extent) for defending the city from outside assault. Conscript soldiers are
called up to serve in case of an attack on the city.</p><p><span>A
typical city guard force works on three eight-hour shifts, with 30% of the
force on a day shift (8 </span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">A</span><span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">M</span><span>. to 4 </span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">P</span><span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">M</span><span>.), 35% on an evening shift (4 </span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">P</span><span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">M</span><span>. to 12 </span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">A</span><span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">M</span><span>.), and 35% on a night shift (12 </span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">A</span><span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">M</span><span>. to 8 </span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">A</span><span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.66667px;">M</span><span>.). At any given time, 80% of the
guards on duty are on the streets patrolling, while the remaining 20% are
stationed at various posts throughout the city, where they can respond to
nearby alarms. At least one such guard post is present within each neighborhood
of a city (each neighborhood consisting of several districts).</span></p><p>The
majority of a city guard force is made up of warriors, mostly 1st level.
Officers include higher-level warriors, fighters, a fair number of clerics, and
wizards or sorcerers, as well as multiclass fighter/spellcasters.</p></section><section id="h4-41-siege-engines"><h4>Siege Engines</h4><p>Siege

Heavy: </span><span>A
heavy catapult is a massive engine capable of throwing rocks or heavy objects
with great force. Because the catapult throws its payload in a high arc, it can
hit squares out of its line of sight. To fire a heavy catapult, the crew chief
makes a special check against DC 15 using only his base attack bonus,
Intelligence modifier, range increment penalty, and the appropriate modifiers
from the lower section of Table 3–26. If the check succeeds, the catapult stone
hits the square the catapult was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage to any
object or character in the square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Reflex
save take half damage. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots
hit the same square unless the catapult is reaimed or the wind changes
direction or speed.</span></p><p>If
a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to determine where it lands. This determines
the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being back toward the catapult and 2
through 8 counting clockwise around the target square. Then, count 3 squares away
from the target square for every range increment of the attack.</p><p>Loading
a catapult requires a series of full-round actions. It takes a DC 15 Strength
check to winch the throwing arm down; most catapults have wheels to allow up to
two crew members to use the aid another action, assisting the main winch
operator. A DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check latches the arm into place,
and then another DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check loads the catapult
ammunition. It takes four full-round actions to reaim a heavy catapult
(multiple crew members can perform these full-round actions in the same round,
so it would take a crew of four only 1 round to reaim the catapult).</p><p>A
heavy catapult takes up a space 15 feet across.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Catapult,
Light: </span><span>This
is a smaller, lighter version of the heavy catapult. It functions as the heavy
catapult, except that it takes a DC 10 Strength check to winch the arm into
place, and only two full-round actions are required to reaim the catapult.</span></p><p>A
light catapult takes up a space 10 feet across.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ballista:</span><span> A ballista is essentially
a Huge heavy crossbow fixed in place. Its size makes it hard for most creatures
to aim it<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>Thus, a Medium creature takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls
when using a ballista, and a Small creature takes a –6 penalty. It takes a
creature smaller than Large two full-round actions to reload the ballista after
firing.</span></p><p>A
ballista takes up a space 5 feet across.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ram:
</span><span>This
heavy pole is sometimes suspended from a movable scaffold that allows the crew
to swing it back and forth against objects. As a full-round action, the
character closest to the front of the ram makes an attack roll against the AC
of the construction, applying the –4 penalty for lack of proficiency. (It’s not
possible to be proficient with this device.) In addition to the damage given on
Table: Siege Engines, up to nine other characters holding the ram can add their
Strength modifier to the ram’s damage, if they devote an attack action to doing
so. It takes at least one Huge or larger creature, two Large creatures, four
Medium-size creatures, or eight Small creatures to swing a ram. (Tiny or
smaller creatures can’t use a ram.)</span></p><p>A
ram is typically 30 feet long. In a battle, the creatures wielding the ram
stand in two adjacent columns of equal length, with the ram between them.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Siege
Tower: </span><span>This
device is a massive wooden tower on wheels or rollers that can be rolled up
against a wall to allow attackers to scale the tower and thus to get to the top
of the wall with cover. The wooden walls are usually 1 foot thick.</span></p><p>A
typical siege tower takes up a space 15 feet across. The creatures inside push
it at a speed of 10 feet (and a siege tower can’t run). The eight creatures
pushing on the ground floor have total cover, and those on higher floors get
improved cover and can fire through arrow slits.</p></section><section id="h4-42-city-streets"><h4>City Streets</h4><p>Typical
city streets are narrow and twisting. Most streets average 15 to 20 feet wide
[(1d4+1)×5 feet)], while alleys range from 10 feet wide to only 5 feet.
Cobblestones in good condition allow normal movement, but ones in poor repair
and heavily rutted dirt streets are considered light rubble, increasing the DC
of Balance and Tumble checks by 2.</p><p>Some
cities have no larger thoroughfares, particularly cities that gradually grew
from small settlements to larger cities. Cities that are planned, or perhaps
have suffered a major fire that allowed authorities to construct new roads
through formerly inhabited areas, might have a few larger streets through town.
These main roads are 25 feet wide—offering room for wagons to pass each
other—with 5-foot-wide sidewalks on either side.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Crowds:
</span><span>Urban
streets are often full of people going about their daily lives. In most cases,
it isn’t necessary to put every 1st-level commoner on the map when a fight
breaks out on the city’s main thoroughfare. Instead just indicate which squares
on the map contain crowds. If crowds see something obviously dangerous, they’ll
move away at 30 feet per round at initiative count 0. It takes 2 squares of
movement to enter a square with crowds. The crowds provide cover for anyone who
does so, enabling a Hide check and providing a bonus to Armor Class and on
Reflex saves.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Directing
Crowds: </span><span>It
takes a DC 15 Diplomacy check or DC 20 Intimidate check to convince a crowd to
move in a particular direction, and the crowd must be able to hear or see the
character making the attempt. It takes a full-round action to make the
Diplomacy check, but only a free action to make the Intimidate check.</span></p><p>If
two or more characters are trying to direct a crowd in different directions,
they make opposed Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to determine whom the crowd
listens to. The crowd ignores everyone if none of the characters’ check results
beat the DCs given above.</p></section><section id="h4-43-above-and-beneath-the-streets"><h4>Above and beneath the Streets</h4><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rooftops:
</span><span>Getting
to a roof usually requires climbing a wall (see the Walls section), unless the
character can reach a roof by jumping down from a higher window, balcony, or
bridge. Flat roofs, common only in warm climates (accumulated snow can cause a
flat roof to collapse), are easy to run across. Moving along the peak of a roof
requires a DC 20 Balance check. Moving on an angled roof surface without
changing altitude (moving parallel to the peak, in other words) requires a DC
15 Balance check. Moving up and down across the peak of a roof requires a DC 10
Balance check.</span></p><p>Eventually
a character runs out of roof, requiring a long jump across to the next roof or
down to the ground. The distance to the next closest roof is usually 1d3×5 feet
horizontally, but the roof across the gap is equally likely to be 5 feet
higher, 5 feet lower, or the same height. Use the guidelines in the Jump skill(a horizontal jump’s peak height is one-fourth of the horizontal distance)
to determine whether a character can make a jump.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Sewers:</span><span> To get into the sewers,
most characters open a grate (a full-round action) and jump down 10 feet.
Sewers are built exactly like dungeons, except that they’re much more likely to
have floors that are slippery or covered with water. Sewers are also similar to
dungeons in terms of creatures liable to be encountered therein. Some cities
were built atop the ruins of older civilizations, so their sewers sometimes
lead to treasures and dangers from a bygone age.</span></p></section><section id="h4-44-city-buildings"><h4>City Buildings</h4><p>Most
city buildings fall into three categories. The majority of buildings in the
city are two to five stories high, built side by side to form long rows
separated by secondary or main streets. These row houses usually have
businesses on the ground floor, with offices or apartments above.</p><p>Inns,
successful businesses, and large warehouses—as well as millers, tanners, and
other businesses that require extra space— are generally large, free-standing
buildings with up to five stories. </p><p>Finally,
small residences, shops, warehouses, or storage sheds are simple, one-story
wooden buildings, especially if they’re in poorer neighborhoods.</p><p>Most
city buildings are made of a combination of stone or clay brick (on the lower
one or two stories) and timbers (for the upper stories, interior walls, and
floors). Roofs are a mixture of boards, thatch, and slates, sealed with pitch.
A typical lower-story wall is 1 foot thick, with AC 3, hardness 8, 90 hp, and a
Climb DC of 25. Upper-story walls are 6 inches thick, with AC 3, hardness 5, 60
hp, and a Climb DC of 21. Exterior doors on most buildings are good wooden
doors that are usually kept locked, except on public buildings such as shops
and taverns.</p></section><section id="h4-45-buying-buildings"><h4>Buying Buildings</h4><p>Characters
might want to buy their own buildings or even construct</p><p>their
own castle. Use the prices in Table: Buildings directly, or as a guide when for
extrapolating costs for more exotic structures.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 14.7em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="2" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table: Buildings</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Item</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Cost</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Simple

a city has main thoroughfares, they are lined with lanterns hanging at a height
of 7 feet from building awnings. These lanterns are spaced 60 feet apart, so
their illumination is all but continuous. Secondary streets and alleys are not
lit; it is common for citizens to hire lantern-bearers when going out after
dark.</p><p>Alleys
can be dark places even in daylight, thanks to the shadows of the tall
buildings that surround them. A dark alley in daylight is rarely dark enough to

snow (1d3 feet), and hurricanes are accompanied by downpours (see above).
Windstorms last for 1d6 hours. Blizzards last for 1d3 days. Hurricanes can last
for up to a week, but their major impact on characters will come in a

weather frequently slows or halts travel and makes it virtually impossible to
navigate from one spot to another. Torrential downpours and blizzards obscure
vision as effectively as a dense fog.</p><p>Most
precipitation is rain, but in cold conditions it can manifest as snow, sleet,
or hail. Precipitation of any kind followed by a cold snap in which the
temperature dips from above freezing to 30° F or below may produce ice. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rain:
</span>Rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a –4 penalty on Spot
and Search checks. It has the same effect on flames, ranged weapon attacks, and
Listen checks as severe wind.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Snow:
</span><span>Falling
snow has the same effects on visibility, ranged weapon attacks, and skill
checks as rain, and it costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered
square. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Heavy
Snow: </span><span>Heavy
snow has the same effects as normal snowfall, but also restricts visibility as
fog does (see Fog, below). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d4 feet of snow on the
ground, and it costs 4 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy
snow. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds may result in snowdrifts
1d4×5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect the
wind—a cabin or a large tent, for instance. There is a 10% chance that a heavy
snowfall is accompanied by lightning (see Thunderstorm, below). Snow has the
same effect on flames as moderate wind.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sleet:
</span><span>Essentially
frozen rain, sleet has the same effect as rain while falling (except that its
chance to extinguish protected flames is 75%) and the same effect as snow once
on the ground. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hail:
</span><span>Hail does
not reduce visibility, but the sound of falling hail makes Listen checks more
difficult (–4 penalty). Sometimes (5% chance) hail can become large enough to
deal 1 point of lethal damage (per storm) to anything in the open. Once on the
ground, hail has the same effect on movement as snow.</span></p></section><section id="h4-49-storms"><h4>Storms</h4><p>The
combined effects of precipitation (or dust) and wind that accompany all storms
reduce visibility ranges by three quarters, imposing a –8 penalty on Spot,
Search, and Listen checks. Storms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except
for those using siege weapons, which have a –4 penalty on attack rolls. They
automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They
cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a
50% chance to extinguish these lights. See Table: Wind Effects for possible
consequences to creatures caught outside without shelter during such a storm.
Storms are divided into the following three types. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Duststorm
(CR 3): </span><span>These
desert storms differ from other storms in that they have no precipitation.
Instead, a duststorm blows fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother
unprotected flames, and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). Most
duststorms are accompanied by severe winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6
inches of sand. However, there is a 10% chance for a greater duststorm to be
accompanied by windstorm-magnitude winds (see Table: Wind Effects). These
greater duststorms deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone
caught out in the open without shelter and also pose a choking hazard (see
Drowning—except that a character with a scarf or similar protection across her
mouth and nose does not begin to choke until after a number of rounds equal to
10 × her Constitution score). Greater duststorms leave 2d3–1 feet of fine sand
in their wake.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Snowstorm:
</span><span>In
addition to the wind and precipitation common to other storms, snowstorms leave
1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Thunderstorm:
</span><span>In addition
to wind and precipitation (usually rain, but sometimes also hail),
thunderstorms are accompanied by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters
without proper shelter (especially those in metal armor). As a rule of thumb,
assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the center of the storm. Each
bolt causes electricity damage equal to 1d10 eight-sided dice. One in ten
thunderstorms is accompanied by a tornado (see below). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Powerful
Storms:</span><span>
Very high winds and torrential precipitation reduce visibility to zero, making
Spot, Search, and Listen checks and all ranged weapon attacks impossible.
Unprotected flames are automatically extinguished, and protected flames have a
75% chance of being doused. Creatures caught in the area must make a DC 20
Fortitude save or face the effects based on the size of the creature (see
Table: Wind Effects). Powerful storms are divided into the</span></p><p>following
four types.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Windstorm:
</span><span>While
accompanied by little or no precipitation, windstorms can cause considerable
damage simply through the force of their wind.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Blizzard:
</span><span>The
combination of high winds, heavy snow (typically 1d3 feet), and bitter cold
make blizzards deadly for all who are unprepared for them.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurricane:
</span><span>In
addition to very high winds and heavy rain, hurricanes are accompanied by
floods. Most adventuring activity is impossible under such conditions.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Tornado:
</span><span>One in
ten thunderstorms is accompanied by a tornado.</span></p></section><section id="h4-50-fog"><h4>Fog</h4><p>Whether
in the form of a low-lying cloud or a mist rising from the ground, fog obscures
all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have
concealment (attacks by or against them have a 20% miss chance).</p></section><section id="h4-51-winds"><h4>Winds</h4><p>The
wind can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, heel over a
small boat, and blow gases or vapors away. If powerful enough, it can even
knock characters down (see Table: Wind Effects), interfere with ranged attacks,
or impose penalties on some skill checks.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Light
Wind: </span><span>A
gentle breeze, having little or no game effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Moderate
Wind: </span><span>A
steady wind with a 50% chance of extinguishing small, unprotected flames, such
as candles.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Strong
Wind: </span><span>Gusts
that automatically extinguish unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the
like). Such gusts impose a –2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and on Listen
checks.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Severe
Wind: </span><span>In
addition to automatically extinguishing any unprotected flames, winds of this
magnitude cause protected flames (such as those of lanterns) to dance wildly
and have a 50% chance of extinguishing these lights. Ranged weapon attacks and
Listen checks are at a –4 penalty. This is the velocity of wind produced by a <span style="font-style: italic;">gust
of wind </span>spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Windstorm:
</span><span>Powerful
enough to bring down branches if not whole trees, windstorms automatically
extinguish unprotected flames and have a 75% chance of blowing out protected
flames, such as those of lanterns. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and
even siege weapons have a –4 penalty on attack rolls. Listen checks are at a –8
penalty due to the howling of the wind. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurricane-Force
Wind: </span><span>All
flames are extinguished. Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege
weapons, which have a –8 penalty on attack rolls). Listen checks are
impossible: All characters can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force
winds often fell trees.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Tornado
(CR 10): </span><span>All
flames are extinguished. All ranged attacks are impossible (even with siege
weapons), as are Listen checks. Instead of being blown away (see Table: Wind
Effects), characters in close proximity to a tornado who fail their Fortitude
saves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact with the actual
funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6
points of damage per round, before being violently expelled (falling damage may
apply). While a tornado’s rotational speed can be as great as 300 mph, the
funnel itself moves forward at an average of 30 mph (roughly 250 feet per
round). A tornado uproots trees, destroys buildings, and causes other similar
forms of major destruction.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table width="617" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 46.2751em; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 55.5001em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="6" style="width: 46.2751em; border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table: Wind Effects</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="width: 6.675em; border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Wind

acids deals 1d6 points of damage per round of exposure except in the case of
total immersion (such as into a vat of acid), which deals 10d6 points of damage
per round. An attack with acid, such as from a hurled vial or a monster’s

fumes from most acids are inhaled poisons. Those who come close enough to a
large body of acid to dunk a creature in it must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or
take 1 point of Constitution damage. All such characters must make a second
save 1 minute later or take another 1d4 points of Constitution damage.</p><p>Creatures
immune to acid’s caustic properties might still drown in it if they are totally
immersed (see Drowning).</p></section><section id="h3-54-cold-dangers"><h3>COLD DANGERS</h3><p>Cold
and exposure deal nonlethal damage to the victim. This nonlethal damage cannot
be recovered until the character gets out of the cold and warms up again. Once
a character is rendered unconscious through the accumulation of nonlethal
damage, the cold and exposure begins to deal lethal damage at the same rate.</p><p>An
unprotected character in cold weather (below 40° F) must make a Fortitude save
each hour (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal

conditions of severe cold or exposure (below 0° F), an unprotected character
must make a Fortitude save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous
check), taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage on each failed save. A character
who has the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and may be
able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill
description). Characters wearing winter clothing only need check once per hour
for cold and exposure damage.</p><p>A
character who takes any nonlethal damage from cold or exposure is beset by
frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as fatigued). These penalties end when the
character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the cold and exposure.</p><p>Extreme
cold (below –20° F) deals 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute (no save). In
addition, a character must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per previous check)

into contact with very cold metal are affected as if by a <span style="font-style: italic;">chill metal </span>spell.</p><section id="h4-55-ice-effects"><h4>Ice Effects</h4><p>Characters
walking on ice must spend 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered by
ice, and the DC for Balance and Tumble checks increases by +5. Characters in
prolonged contact with ice may run the risk of taking damage from severe cold
(see above).</p></section></section><section id="h3-56-darkness"><h3>DARKNESS</h3><p>Darkvision
allows many characters and monsters to see perfectly well without any light at
all, but characters with normal vision (or low-light vision, for that matter)
can be rendered completely blind by putting out the lights. Torches or lanterns
can be blown out by sudden gusts of subterranean wind, magical light sources
can be dispelled or countered, or magical traps might create fields of
impenetrable darkness.</p><p>In
many cases, some characters or monsters might be able to see, while others are
blinded. For purposes of the following points, a blinded creature is one who
simply can’t see through the surrounding darkness.</p><p>—Creatures
blinded by darkness lose the ability to deal extra damage due to precision (for
example, a sneak attack).</p><p>—Blinded
creatures are hampered in their movement, and pay 2 squares of movement per
square moved into (double normal cost). Blinded creatures can’t run or charge.</p><p>—All
opponents have total concealment from a blinded creature, so the blinded
creature has a 50% miss chance in combat. A blinded creature must first
pinpoint the location of an opponent in order to attack the right square; if
the blinded creature launches an attack without pinpointing its foe, it attacks
a random square within its reach. For ranged attacks or spells against a foe
whose location is not pinpointed, roll to determine which adjacent square the
blinded creature is facing; its attack is directed at the closest target that
lies in that direction.</p><p>—A
blinded creature loses its Dexterity adjustment to AC and takes a –2 penalty to
AC.</p><p>—A
blinded creature takes a –4 penalty on Search checks and most Strength- and
Dexterity-based skill checks, including any with an armor check penalty. A
creature blinded by darkness automatically fails any skill check relying on
vision.</p><p>—Creatures
blinded by darkness cannot use gaze attacks and are immune to gaze attacks.</p><p>A
creature blinded by darkness can make a Listen check as a free action each
round in order to locate foes (DC equal to opponents’ Move Silently checks). A
successful check lets a blinded character hear an unseen creature “over there
somewhere.” It’s almost impossible to pinpoint the location of an unseen
creature. A Listen check that beats the DC by 20 reveals the unseen creature’s
square (but the unseen creature still has total concealment from the blinded
creature).</p><p>—A
blinded creature can grope about to find unseen creatures. A character can make
a touch attack with his hands or a weapon into two adjacent squares using a
standard action. If an unseen target is in the designated square, there is a
50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals
no damage but has pinpointed the unseen creature’s current location. (If the
unseen creature moves, its location is once again unknown.)</p><p>—If
a blinded creature is struck by an unseen foe, the blinded character pinpoints
the location of the creature that struck him (until the unseen creature moves,
of course). The only exception is if the unseen creature has a reach greater
than 5 feet (in which case the blinded character knows the location of the
unseen opponent, but has not pinpointed him) or uses a ranged attack (in which
case, the blinded character knows the general direction of the foe, but not his
location).</p><p>—A
creature with the scent ability automatically pinpoints unseen creatures within
5 feet of its location.</p></section><section id="h3-57-falling"><h3>FALLING</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Falling
Damage:</span><span>
The basic rule is simple: 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen, to a maximum
of 20d6.</span></p><p>If
a character deliberately jumps instead of merely slipping or falling, the
damage is the same but the first 1d6 is nonlethal damage. A DC 15 Jump check or
DC 15 Tumble check allows the character to avoid any damage from the first 10
feet fallen and converts any damage from the second 10 feet to nonlethal
damage. Thus, a character who slips from a ledge 30 feet up takes 3d6 damage.
If the same character deliberately jumped, he takes 1d6 points of nonlethal
damage and 2d6 points of lethal damage. And if the character leaps down with a
successful Jump or Tumble check, he takes only 1d6 points of nonlethal damage
and 1d6 points of lethal damage from the plunge.</p><p>Falls
onto yielding surfaces (soft ground, mud) also convert the first 1d6 of damage
to nonlethal damage. This reduction is cumulative with reduced damage due to
deliberate jumps and the Jump skill.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Falling
into Water:</span><span>
Falls into water are handled somewhat differently. If the water is at least 10
feet deep, the first 20 feet of falling do no damage. The next 20 feet do
nonlethal damage (1d3 per 10-foot increment). Beyond that, falling damage is
lethal damage (1d6 per additional 10-foot increment).</span></p><p>Characters
who deliberately dive into water take no damage on a successful DC 15 Swim
check or DC 15 Tumble check, so long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for
every 30 feet fallen. However, the DC of the check increases by 5 for every 50
feet of the dive. </p></section><section id="h3-58-falling-objects"><h3>FALLING OBJECTS</h3><p>Just
as characters take damage when they fall more than 10 feet, so too do they take
damage when they are hit by falling objects.</p><p>Objects
that fall upon characters deal damage based on their weight and the distance
they have fallen.</p><p>For
each 200 pounds of an object’s weight, the object deals 1d6 points of damage,
provided it falls at least 10 feet. Distance also comes into play, adding an
additional 1d6 points of damage for every 10-foot increment it falls beyond the
first (to a maximum of 20d6 points of damage).</p><p>Objects
smaller than 200 pounds also deal damage when dropped, but they must fall
farther to deal the same damage. Use Table: Damage from Falling Objects to see
how far an object of a given weight must drop to deal 1d6 points of damage.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 18.675em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="2" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table:

characters as well (see the skill description). Characters reduced to
unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per hour).</p><p>In
severe heat (above 110° F), a character must make a Fortitude save once every
10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal
damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a –4
penalty on their saves. A character with the Survival skill may receive a bonus
on this saving throw and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as
well. Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4
points per each 10-minute period).</p><p>A
character who takes any nonlethal damage from heat exposure now suffers from
heatstroke and is fatigued.</p><p>These
penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from
the heat.</p><p>Extreme
heat (air temperature over 140° F, fire, boiling water, lava) deals lethal
damage. Breathing air in these temperatures deals 1d6 points of damage per
minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5
minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage.
Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a –4 penalty on their
saves. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very
hot metal are affected as if by a <span style="font-style: italic;">heat metal </span>spell.</p><p>Boiling
water deals 1d6 points of scalding damage, unless the character is fully
immersed, in which case it deals 10d6 points of damage per round of exposure.</p><section id="h4-60-catching-on-fire"><h4>Catching on Fire</h4><p>Characters
exposed to burning oil, bonfires, and noninstantaneous magic firesmight
find their clothes, hair, or equipment on fire. Spells with an instantaneous
durationdon’t normally set a character on fire, since the heat and
flame from these come and go in a flash.</p><p>Characters
at risk of catching fire are allowed a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid this fate. If
a character’s clothes or hair catch fire, he takes 1d6 points of damage
immediately. In each subsequent round, the burning character must make another
Reflex saving throw. Failure means he takes another 1d6 points of damage that
round. Success means that the fire has gone out. (That is, once he succeeds on
his saving throw, he’s no longer on fire.)</p><p>A
character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by jumping into
enough water to douse himself. If no body of water is at hand, rolling on the
ground or smothering the fire with cloaks or the like permits the character
another save with a +4 bonus.</p><p>Those
unlucky enough to have their clothes or equipment catch fire must make DC 15
Reflex saves for each item. Flammable items that fail take the same amount of
damage as the character.</p></section><section id="h4-61-lava-effects"><h4>Lava Effects</h4><p>Lava
or magma deals 2d6 points of damage per round of exposure, except in the case
of total immersion (such as when a character falls into the crater of an active
volcano), which deals 20d6 points of damage per round.</p><p>Damage
from magma continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional
damage is only half of that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6
points per round).</p><p>An
immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity to lava or magma. However,
a creature immune to fire might still drown if completely immersed in lava (see
Drowning, below).</p></section></section><section id="h3-62-smoke-effects"><h3>SMOKE EFFECTS</h3><p>A
character who breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude save each round (DC
15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A
character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal
damage.</p><p>Smoke
obscures vision, giving concealment (20% miss chance) to characters within it.</p></section><section id="h3-63-starvation-and-thirst"><h3>STARVATION AND
THIRST</h3><p>Characters
might find themselves without food or water and with no means to obtain them.
In normal climates, Medium characters need at least a gallon of fluids and
about a pound of decent food per day to avoid starvation. (Small characters
need half as much.) In very hot climates, characters need two or three times as
much water to avoid dehydration.</p><p>A
character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of hours equal to his
Constitution score. After this time, the character must make a Constitution
check each hour (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of
nonlethal damage.</p><p>A
character can go without food for 3 days, in growing discomfort. After this
time, the character must make a Constitution check each day (DC 10, +1 for each
previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.</p><p>Characters
who have taken nonlethal damage from lack of food or water are fatigued.
Nonlethal damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the
character gets food or water, as needed—not even magic that restores hit points
heals this damage.</p></section><section id="h3-64-suffocation"><h3>SUFFOCATION</h3><p>A
character who has no air to breathe can hold her breath for 2 rounds per point
of Constitution. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10
Constitution check in order to continue holding her breath. The save must be
repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.</p><p>When
the character fails one of these Constitution checks, she begins to suffocate.
In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hit points). In the following
round, she drops to –1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, she
suffocates.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Slow
Suffocation:</span><span>
A Medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring
10 feet on a side. After that time, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal
damage every 15 minutes. Each additional Medium character or significant fire
source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will
last.</span></p><p>Small
characters consume half as much air as Medium characters. A larger volume of
air, of course, lasts for a longer time. </p></section><section id="h3-65-water-dangers"><h3>WATER DANGERS</h3><p>Any
character can wade in relatively calm water that isn’t over his head, no check
required. Similarly, swimming in calm water only requires skill checks with a
DC of 10. Trained swimmers can just take 10. (Remember, however, that armor or
heavy gear makes any attempt at swimming much more difficult. See the Swim
skill description<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>)</p><p>By
contrast, fast-moving water is much more dangerous. On a successful DC 15 Swim
check or a DC 15 Strength check, it deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per
round (1d6 points of lethal damage if flowing over rocks and cascades). On a
failed check, the character must make another check that round to avoid going
under.</p><p>Very
deep water is not only generally pitch black, posing a navigational hazard, but
worse, it deals water pressure damage of 1d6 points per minute for every 100
feet the character is below the surface. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15, +1
for each previous check) means the diver takes no damage in that minute. Very
cold water deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hypothermia per minute of
exposure.</p><section id="h4-66-drowning"><h4>Drowning</h4><p>Any
character can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to twice her
Constitution score. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10
Constitution check every round in order to continue holding her breath. Each
round, the DC increases by 1. </p><p>When
the character finally fails her Constitution check, she begins to drown. In the
first round, she falls unconscious (0 hp). In the following round, she drops to
–1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, she drowns.</p><p>It
is possible to drown in substances other than water, such as sand, quicksand,
fine dust, and silos full of grain.</p></section></section></section></section></body></html>
