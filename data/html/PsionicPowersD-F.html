subject attacks itself as a full-round action. The attack automatically

its opponent an opening, which the opponent may or may not choose to take
advantage of.</p><p>If the subject
is unarmed and no enemy is nearby, the subject simply does nothing at all. A

yourself, creating a duplicate that comes into existence 5 feet away. Your
duplicate thinks and acts exactly as you do and follows your orders, although
it will not do anything you wouldn’t do yourself. Your duplicate has all your
abilities but none of your psionic or magical equipment (it does possess a
duplicate of all your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well
as mundane versions of any psionic or magical equipment you have). You and your
duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining usages of pertinent
special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you
maintain such when this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself
with two negative levels for the purpose of determining the powers to which the
duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative
levels cannot be removed by any means). Your duplicate has all other physical
traits you had at the time you manifest this power. Powers, spells, or other
effects affecting you when you manifest this power do not transfer to your
duplicate. </p><p>When the
duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your duplicate rejoin,
no matter how far from each other you are. You gain back any power points the
duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining, you take half of the damage
your duplicate has taken since this power was manifested. This damage could
potentially leave you with negative hit points, but it can’t reduce your hit
points to less than –9.</p><p>If your
duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain
one negative level. If you die, your duplicate remains in existence, and is for
all intents you, but with two negative levels. (Once the duration expires, one
of the negative levels immediately converts to one lost level; the other
negative level can be removed by standard means.)</p><p>You can have
only one <span style="font-style: italic;">fissioned </span>duplicate in existence at one time; your duplicate
cannot use this power. You cannot use <span style="font-style: italic;">fusion </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">metaconcert </span>with
a duplicate, or share any other power or effect that pools abilities (the sum
of you and you is still just you). Similarly, attempting to use powers such as <span style="font-style: italic;">claws
of the vampire </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">vampiric blade </span>to hurt your duplicate only damages
your duplicate; these powers do not heal you. <span style="font-style: italic;">Empathic transfer </span>and
similar powers are likewise ineffective (transferring wounds to yourself isn’t
a good healing strategy).</p><p>All powers
