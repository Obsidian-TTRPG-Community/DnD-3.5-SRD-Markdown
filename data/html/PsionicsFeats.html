Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game
License v1.0a.</div><h2 id="psionic-feats">PSIONIC FEATS</h2><br><div>Psionic feats
are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest
powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have
psi-like abilities.)</div><div>Because psionic
feats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats
do not grant supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as
powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as
noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power
resistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas
where psionics is suppressed, such as a <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics field. </span>Leaving
such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.</div><div>Many psionic
feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to
expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus
does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a
feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for
which you expended it.</div><br><h3 id="psionic-item-creation-feats">PSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS</h3><div>Manifesters can
use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is
draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every
psionic item he or she creates.</div><div>A psionic item
creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type.
Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats
all have certain features in common.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">XP Cost:</span><span> Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is
expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a
psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A
character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level.
However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can
immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance
a level.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Raw
Materials Cost:</span><span> Creating a psionic item requires
costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these
materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.</span></div><div>Using a psionic
item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop,
special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he
or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he’s traveling far
from home).</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Time:</span><span> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost
of the item. The minimum time is one day.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Item Cost:</span><span> Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that
directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items
depends on their manifester level—that is, a power from such an item has the
strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that
is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly
discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item,
the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character
creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points,
the character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the
item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent.
(Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified
in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other
level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according
to the effective manifester level.</span></div><div>The price of
psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends
on the level of the power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s
manifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the
power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s
manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as
shown below.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Power
Stones: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester level
x 25 gp</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Psionic
Tattoos: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester
level x 50 gp</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Dorjes: </span><span>Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Extra Costs:</span><span> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with
an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. </span></div><div>For psionic
tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the
item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost. </div><div>Some psionic
items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</div><br><h3 id="metapsionic-feats">METAPSIONIC FEATS</h3><div>As a
manifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in
ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or
learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more
expensive than manifesting the power normally.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifesting
Time:</span><span> Powers manifested using metapsionic feats
take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat
description specifically says otherwise.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifestation
Cost:</span><span> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic
character must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill
description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat
description.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Limits on
Use:</span><span> As with all powers, you cannot spend more
power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely
let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this
rule. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effects of
Metapsionic Feats on a Power:</span><span> In all ways, a
metapsionic power operates at its original power level, even though it costs
additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic
feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a
metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or
other device.</span></div><div>Manifesting a
power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of
opportunity.</div><div>Some
metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific
feat entry.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Psionic
Items and Metapsionic Powers:</span><span> With the right
psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone,
psionic tattoo, or dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the power’s
higher metapsionic level. </span></div><div>A character
doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a
metapsionic power is stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such
an item.</div><br><h2 id="feat-descriptions">FEAT DESCRIPTIONS</h2><div>These feat
descriptions follow the standard format.</div><br><h3 id="aligned-attack"><span>ALIGNED ATTACK </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>Your melee or
ranged attack overcomes your opponent’s alignment-based damage reduction and
deals additional damage.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Base attack bonus +6.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law.
(Your choice must match one of your alignment components. Once you’ve made this
alignment choice, it cannot be changed.</span></div><div>To use this
feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you make a successful melee or
ranged attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, and your attack is treated
as either a good, evil, chaotic, or lawful attack (depending on your original
choice) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</div><div>You must decide
whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack
misses, you still expend your psionic focus.</div><br><h3 id="antipsionic-magic"><span>ANTIPSIONIC MAGIC </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>Your spells are
more potent when used against psionic characters and creatures.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Spellcraft 5 ranks.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You get a get a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome a
psionic creature’s power resistance.</span></div><div>This bonus
stacks with the bonus conferred by Spell Penetration and Greater Spell
Penetration. Moreover, whenever a psionic creature attempts to dispel a spell
you cast, it makes its manifester level check against a DC of 13 + its manifester
level.</div><div>The benefits of
this feat apply only to power resistance. </div><div>The bonus does
not apply to spell resistance. This is an exception to the psionics–magic
transparency rule.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use
powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).</span></div><br><h3 id="autonomous"><span>AUTONOMOUS </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>You have a
knack for psionic self-sufficiency.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You get a +2 bonus on all Autohypnosis checks and Knowledge
(psionics) checks.</span></div><br><h3 id="body-fuel"><span>BODY FUEL </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can expand
your power point total at the expense of your health.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can recover 2 power points by taking 1 point of ability burn
damage to each of your three ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution.</span></div><div>You can recover
additional power points for a proportional cost to Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution. These recovered points are added to your power point reserve as
if you had gained them by resting overnight.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> Only living creatures can use this feat. You can take advantage of
this feat only while in your own body.</span></div><br><h3 id="boost-construct"><span>BOOST CONSTRUCT </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>Your astral
constructs have more abilities.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> When you create an astral construct, you can give it one additional
special ability from any menu that the construct currently has an ability from.</span></div><br><h3 id="burrowing-power"><span>BURROWING POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>Your powers
sometimes bypass barriers.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can
attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a
wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to
bypass the barrier.</span></div><div>The strength
and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully
bypass the barrier with your power, you make a Psicraft check against a DC
equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum
1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as
force effects (or a <span style="font-style: italic;">wall of ectoplasm</span>). Force walls or <span style="font-style: italic;">walls of
ectoplasm </span>are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted
otherwise.</div><div>If a power
requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or
targets instead of an area), you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless
you can somehow see the target, such as with <span style="font-style: italic;">clairvoyant sense</span>. Using
this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total
cost cannot exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="chain-power"><span>CHAIN POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can
manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary
target. </div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can chain
any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold,
electricity, fire, or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the
power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level
(maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as
much damage as the primary one did (round down).</span></div><div>Each target
gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose
secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the
primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to
affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area,
for example).</div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="chaotic-mind"><span>CHAOTIC MIND </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>The turbulence
of your thoughts prevents others from gaining insight into your actions.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Chaotic alignment, Cha 15.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> Creatures and characters who have an insight bonus on their attack
rolls, an insight bonus to their Armor Class, or an insight bonus on skill
checks or ability checks do not gain those bonuses against you.</span></div><div>The benefit of
this feat applies only to insight bonuses gained from psionic powers and
psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency
rule.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use
powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).</span></div><br><h3 id="cloak-dance"><span>CLOAK DANCE </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>You are skilled
at using optical tricks to make yourself seem to be where you are not.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisites:</span><span> Hide 10 ranks, Perform (dance) 2 ranks.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can take a move action to obscure your exact position. Until
your next turn, you have concealment. Alternatively, you can take a full-round
action to entirely obscure your exact position. Until your next action, you
have total concealment.</span></div><br><h3 id="closed-mind"><span>CLOSED MIND </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>Your mind is
better able to resist psionics than normal.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You get a +2 bonus on all saving throws to resist powers.</span></div><div>The benefit of
this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an
exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use
powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).</span></div><br><h3 id="combat-manifestation"><span>COMBAT MANIFESTATION </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You are adept
at manifesting powers in combat.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You get a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to manifest a power
or use a psi-like ability while on the defensive or while you are grappling or
pinned.</span></div><br><h3 id="craft-cognizance-crystal"><span>CRAFT COGNIZANCE CRYSTAL </span><small>[ITEM
CREATION]</small></h3><div>You can create
psionic <span style="font-style: italic;">cognizance crystals </span>that store power points.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:
</span><span>Manifester level 3rd.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can create a <span style="font-style: italic;">cognizance crystal</span>. Doing so takes one day
for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a <span style="font-style: italic;">cognizance crystal </span>is
equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all its stored power
points, squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp. To create a <span style="font-style: italic;">cognizance crystal</span>,
you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing
one-half its base price.</span></div><br><h3 id="craft-dorje"><span>CRAFT DORJE </span><small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3><div>You can create
slender crystal wands called dorjes than manifest powers when charges are
expended.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Manifester level 5th.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can create a dorje of any psionic power you know (barring
exceptions, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">bestow power</span>, as noted in a power’s description).
Crafting a dorje takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base
price of a dorje is its manifester level x the power level x 750 gp. To craft a
dorje, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials
costing one-half of this base price.</span></div><div>A newly created
dorje has 50 charges.</div><div>Any dorje that
stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to
the XP cost derived from the base price, you must pay fifty times the XP cost.</div><br><h3 id="craft-psicrown"><span>CRAFT PSICROWN </span><small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3><div>You can create
psicrowns, which have multiple psionic effects.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Manifester level 12th.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can create any psicrown whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting
a psicrown takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a
psicrown, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials
costing one-half of its base price. Some psicrowns incur extra costs in XP as
noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from
the psicrown’s base price.</span></div><br><h3 id="craft-psionic-arms-and-armor"><span>CRAFT PSIONIC ARMS AND ARMOR </span><small>[ITEM
CREATION]</small></h3><div>You can create
psionic weapons, armor, and shields.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Manifester level 5th.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can create any psionic weapon, armor, or shield whose
prerequisites you meet. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes one
day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its psionic features. To enhance a
weapon, you must spend 1/25 of its features’ total price in XP and use up raw
materials costing one-half of this total price.</span></div><div>The weapon,
armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its
cost is not included in the above cost.</div><div>You can also
mend a broken psionic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you
could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the
time it would take to enhance that item in the first place.</div><br><h3 id="craft-psionic-construct"><span>CRAFT PSIONIC CONSTRUCT </span><small>[ITEM
CREATION]</small></h3><div>You can create
golems and other psionic automatons that obey your orders.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisites:</span><span> Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, Craft Universal Item.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can create any psionic construct whose prerequisites you meet.
Creating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To
create a construct, you must spend 1/25 of the construct’s base price in XP and
use up raw materials costing one-half of this price. A newly created construct
has average hit points for its Hit Dice.</span></div><br><h3 id="craft-universal-item"><span>CRAFT UNIVERSAL ITEM </span><small>[ITEM
CREATION]</small></h3><div>You can create
universal psionic items.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Manifester level 3rd.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can create any universal psionic item whose prerequisites you
meet. Crafting a universal psionic item takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its
base price. To craft a universal psionic item, you must spend 1/25 of the
item’s base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this price.</span></div><div>You can also
mend a broken universal item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs
half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft
that item in the first place.</div><div>Some universal
items incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are
in addition to those derived from the item’s base price. You must pay such a
cost to create an item or to mend a broken one.</div><br><h3 id="deadly-precision"><span>DEADLY PRECISION </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>You empty your
mind of all distracting emotion, becoming an instrument of deadly precision.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Dex 15, base attack bonus +5.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You have deadly accuracy with your sneak attacks. You can reroll
any result of 1 on your sneak attack’s extra damage dice. You must keep the
result of the reroll, even if it is another 1.</span></div><br><h3 id="deep-impact"><span>DEEP IMPACT </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can strike
your foe with a melee weapon as if making a touch attack.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Str 13, Psionic Weapon, base attack bonus +5.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can
resolve your attack with a melee weapon as a touch attack. You must decide
whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack
misses, you still expend your psionic focus.</span></div><br><h3 id="delay-power"><span>DELAY POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can
manifest powers that go off up to 5 rounds later.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can
manifest a power as a delayed power. A delayed power doesn’t activate
immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three trigger
mechanisms: (1) The power activates when you take a standard action to activate
it; (2) It activates when a creature enters the area that the power will affect
(only powers that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or (3) It
activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two
triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates
automatically on the fifth round.</span></div><div>Only area and
personal powers can be delayed.</div><div>Any decisions
you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designating
targets, or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the power is
manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected by the power, including
saving throws, are decided when the delay period ends.</div><div>A delayed power
can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the
area or on the target by the use of powers that can detect psionic effects. </div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="empower-power"><span>EMPOWER POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can
manifest powers to greater effect.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.</span></div><div>You can empower
a power. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered power are increased by
one-half. An empowered power deals half again as much damage as normal, cures
half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and so
forth, as appropriate. Augmented powers can also be empowered (multiply 1-1/2
times the damage total of the augmented power). Saving throws and opposed
checks (such as the one you make when you manifest <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span>) are
not affected, nor are powers without random variables.</div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="enlarge-power"><span>ENLARGE POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can
manifest powers farther than normal.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter
a power with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%.
An enlarged power with a range of close has a range of 50 feet + 5 feet per
level, a medium-range power has a range of 200 feet + 20 feet per level, and a
long-range power has a range of 800 feet + 80 feet per level.</span></div><div>Powers whose
ranges are not defined by distance, as well as powers whose ranges are not
close, medium, or long, are</div><div>not affected.</div><div>Using this feat
does not increase the power point cost of the power.</div><br><h3 id="expanded-knowledge"><span>EXPANDED KNOWLEDGE </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You learn
another power.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisites:</span><span> Manifester level 3rd.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> Add to your powers known one additional power of any level up to
one level lower than the highest-level power you can manifest. You can choose
any power, including powers from another discipline’s list or even from another
class’s list.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you learn one new
power at any level up to one less than the highest-level power you can
manifest.</span></div><br><h3 id="extend-power"><span>EXTEND POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can
manifest powers that last longer than normal.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.</span></div><div>You can
manifest an extended power. An extended power lasts twice as long as normal. A
power with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent is not
affected by this feat.</div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="fell-shot"><span>FELL SHOT </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can strike
your foe with a ranged weapon as if making a touch attack.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Dex 13, Point Blank Shot, Psionic Shot, base attack bonus +5.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can
resolve your ranged attack as a ranged touch attack.</span></div><div>You must decide
whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack
misses, you still expend your psionic focus.</div><br><h3 id="focused-sunder"><span>FOCUSED SUNDER </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can sense
the stress points on others’ weapons.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Str 13, Power Attack, Improved Sunder.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.</span></div><div>When you strike
at an opponent’s weapon, you ignore half of the weapon’s total hardness (round
down). Total hardness includes any magical or psionic enhancements possessed by
the weapon that increase its hardness.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You can also sense the stress points in any hard construction, such

different target instead of firing all of them at the same target. You make a
separate attack roll for each arrow, regardless of whether you fire them at
separate targets or the same target. Your precision-based damage applies to each
arrow fired, and, if you score a critical hit with more than one of the arrows,
each critical hit deals critical damage.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> A fighter may select this feat as one of his fighter bonus feats.</span></div><br><h3 id="greater-power-penetration"><span>GREATER POWER PENETRATION </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>Your powers are

level + your Charisma bonus or take 2d6 points of damage.</span></div><div>The benefit of
this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an

power stones to store psionic powers.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Manifester level 1st.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You can create a power stone of any power that you know. Encoding a
power stone takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price
of a power stone is the level of the stored power x its manifester level x 25
gp. To imprint a power stone, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and
use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.</span></div><div>Any power stone

personality fragment in your psicrystal, from which you derive the noted
benefits, and you treat your level as one higher for the purpose of determining
your psicrystal’s abilities.</span></div><br><h3 id="inquisitor"><span>INQUISITOR </span><small>[PSIONIC] </small></h3><div>You know when

number of hit points, affects the maximum number of targets, and so on, as
appropriate. Saving throws and opposed checks are not affected, nor are powers
without random variables.</div><div>Augmented
powers can be maximized; a maximized augmented power deals the maximum damage
(or cures the maximum hit points, and so on) of the augmented power.</div><div>An empowered

result plus one-half the normally rolled result.</div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="mental-leap"><span>MENTAL LEAP </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can make

any.</span></div><div>You gain only
three uses of the metamorphic ability per day, even if the creature into which
you metamorph has a higher limit on uses (You are still subject to other

ability gained through Metamorphic Transfer (if it is an attack) is 10 + your
Cha modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Normal:</span><span> You cannot use the supernatural abilities of creatures whose form
you assume.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you can gain one

attacks of opportunity.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you make
an attack of opportunity, you can use any power you know with a range of touch,
if you have at least one hand free.</span></div><div>Manifesting
this power is an immediate action.</div><div>You cannot use
this feat with a touch power whose manifesting time is longer than 1 full-round

you take 3d8 points of damage. At 15th level, you can increase your effective
manifester level by three, but you take 5d8 points of damage.</span></div><div>The effective
increase in manifester level increases the number of power points you can
expend on a single power manifestation, as well as increasing all manifester
level-dependent effects, such as range, duration, and overcoming power
resistance.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Normal:</span><span> Your manifester level is equal to your total levels in classes that
manifest powers.</span></div><br><h3 id="power-penetration"><span>POWER PENETRATION </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>Your powers are

your psicrystal. At any time when you need to expend your psionic focus, you

focusing yourself. The psicrystal cannot focus itself—only the owner can spend
the time to focus the crystal.</span></div><br><h3 id="psionic-affinity"><span>PSIONIC AFFINITY </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>You have a

its psionic focus, if any. Also, if you are the target of a power, the
manifester of the power must spend an additional number of power points equal

in the same round that you manifest a quickened power. You can manifest only
one quickened power per round. A power whose manifesting time is longer than 1
round cannot be quickened.</span></div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot

creating the tattoo.</div><br><h3 id="sidestep-charge"><span>SIDESTEP CHARGE </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You are skilled
at dodging past charging opponents and taking advantage when they miss.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Dex 13, Dodge.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against charge attacks. If
a charging opponent fails to make a successful attack against you, you gain an
immediate attack of opportunity. This feat does not grant you more attacks of
opportunity than you are normally allowed in a round. If you are flat-footed or
otherwise denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, you do not gain the
benefit of this feat.</span></div><br><h3 id="speed-of-thought"><span>SPEED OF THOUGHT </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>The energy of
your mind energizes the alacrity of your body.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Wis 13.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> As long as you are psionically focused and not wearing heavy armor,
you gain an insight bonus to your speed of 10 feet.</span></div><br><h3 id="split-psionic-ray"><span>SPLIT PSIONIC RAY </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can affect
two targets with a single ray.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Any other metapsionic feat.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can split
psionic rays you manifest. The split ray affects any two targets that are both
within the power’s range and within 30 feet of each other. If the ray deals
damage, each target takes as much damage as a single target would take.</span></div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 2.</div><br><h3 id="stand-still"><span>STAND STILL </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>You can prevent
foes from fleeing or closing.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Str 13.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> When a foe’s movement out of a square you threaten grants you an
attack of opportunity, you can give up that attack and instead attempt to stop
your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity normally. If you hit
your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage
roll (the opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he
had used up his move actions for the round.</span></div><div>Since you use
the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only
a number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could
make an attack of opportunity (normally just one).</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Normal:</span><span> Attacks of opportunity cannot halt your foes in their tracks.</span></div><br><h3 id="talented"><span>TALENTED </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can
overchannel powers with less cost to yourself.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Overchannel.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When
manifesting a power of 3rd level or lower, you do not take damage from
overchanneling.</span></div><br><h3 id="twin-power"><span>TWIN POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can
manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can twin
a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take
effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting
the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the
power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of
the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers
individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some
cases, such as a twinned <span style="font-style: italic;">psionic charm</span>, failing both saving throws
results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target
would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm
effect).</span></div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="unavoidable-strike"><span>UNAVOIDABLE STRIKE </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can make an
unarmed strike or use a natural weapon against your foe as if delivering a
touch attack.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Str 13, Psionic Fist, base attack bonus +5.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can
resolve your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon as a touch attack.</span></div><div>You must decide
whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack
misses, you still expend your psionic focus.</div><br><h3 id="unconditional-power"><span>UNCONDITIONAL POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>Disabling
conditions do not hold you back.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Your mental
strength is enough to overcome some otherwise disabling conditions. You can
manifest an unconditional power when you are dazed, <span style="font-style: italic;">confused, </span>nauseated,
shaken, or stunned.</span></div><div>Only personal
powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional
powers.</div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 8. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="up-the-walls"><span>UP THE WALLS </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can run on
walls for brief distances.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Wis 13.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your
move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if
you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve
on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end
your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as
appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal
floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or
wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on
the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special:</span><span> You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a
wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from
the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you
threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you
fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.</span></div><br><h3 id="widen-power"><span>WIDEN POWER </span><small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3><div>You can
increase the area of your powers.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter
a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers
that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this
feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power’s area increase by 100%.</span></div><div>Using this feat
increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot
exceed your manifester level.</div><br><h3 id="wild-talent"><span>WILD TALENT </span><small>[GENERAL]</small></h3><div>Your mind wakes
to a previously unrealized talent for psionics.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> Your latent power of psionics flares to life, conferring upon you
the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a
reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and
psionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest
powers simply by virtue of having this feat.</span></div><br><h3 id="wounding-attack"><span>WOUNDING ATTACK </span><small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3><div>Your vicious
attacks wound your foe.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Prerequisite:</span><span> Base attack bonus +8.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Benefit:</span><span> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can make
an attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1
point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt.</span></div><div>You must decide
whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack
misses, you still expend your psionic focus.</div></div></body></html>
