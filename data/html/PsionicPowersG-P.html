Points:</span><span> 17, XP</span></div><div>You create a
finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power
are very small, very minor planes. This power works best when manifested while
you are on the Astral Plane. Manifestation of this power creates a local
density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first,
the fledgling plane grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial
maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from the surrounding
astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn’t
really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week
(approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per year). Once your demiplane is
created, you can travel to it using <span style="font-style: italic;">astral caravan</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">plane shift</span>,
or some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.</div><div>You determine
the environment within the demiplane when you manifest <span style="font-style: italic;">genesis, </span>reflecting
most any desire you can visualize. You determine factors such as atmosphere,
water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot
create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as
buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). You must add these details in
some other fashion if you desire. You can’t create lingering psionic effects with
this power; you have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can’t
create a demiplane out of esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you’re
limited to stone and dirt. You can’t manipulate the time trait on your
demiplane; its time trait is as the Material Plane. Once your demiplane reaches
180 feet in radius, you can manifest this power again to gradually add another
180 feet of radius to it, and so on.</div><div>Antigenesis: If
<span style="font-style: italic;">genesis </span>is manifested on the Material Plane, the power takes effect and
the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger
than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of the new plane are exactly
canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead spot like a
limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot
wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water,
leaving behind a uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures that pass
the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly affected, but plants can
find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die
quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the
area alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains in the
dead spot, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years
by bacteria, plants, and animals.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">XP Cost: </span><span>1,000 XP.</span></div><br><h3 id="graft-weapon">Graft Weapon</h3><div>Psychometabolism</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level:</span><span> Psychic warrior 3</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Display:</span><span> Olfactory</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifesting

Points:</span><span> 5</span></div><div>You attach any
melee weapon you can use in one hand—mundane, psionic, or magical—onto the end
of one of your arms. The weapon becomes a natural extension of your arm, and
that hand blends seamlessly into the shaft, hilt, or head of the weapon. Now
that the weapon and you are one, you gain a +1 competence bonus on all attack
and damage rolls while using the weapon.</div><div>The grafted
weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural weapon for the
purpose of effects that distinguish between either weapon type. For instance,
the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for the purpose of delivering
a touch attack with a power in conjunction with the weapon attack. As with any
power (or spell) melee touch attack made in conjunction with a natural weapon
attack, the touch attack effect is not delivered unless the natural weapon
strikes normally; on a failed attack, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.</div><div>For a psychic
warrior under the effect of the <span style="font-style: italic;">claws of the beast </span>power, grafting a
weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base damage of the weapon,
instead of the claw upon which a psychic warrior normally relies.</div><div>While your hand
is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take a –2 penalty on
all skill checks requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily polymorph
or metamorph you can ignore the grafted weapon or alter it normally, at your
discretion. If the weapon takes damage, you take damage as well. If you are
healed, so is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently
lose 2 points of Constitution; the ability drain persists until you can restore
your natural anatomy (by means of <span style="font-style: italic;">regenerate </span>or a similar effect).</div><div>When this
power’s duration expires, the grafted weapon falls to the ground and your hand
returns.</div><br><h3 id="grease-psionic">Grease, Psionic</h3><div>Metacreativity

Points:</span><span> 7</span></div><div>You assume the
form of a creature of the same type as your normal form, or any other type
except construct, elemental, outsider, and undead. The assumed form can have as
many Hit Dice as your manifester level, to a maximum of 15.</div><div>You can’t
assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you assume an incorporeal,
ectoplasmic, or gaseous form. You cannot take the form of any creature that has
a template. Your type and subtype (if applicable) change to match the new form.</div><div>Upon changing,
you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this
healing does not restore ability damage and provide other benefits of resting;
and changing back does not heal you further). If you are slain while under the
effect of this power, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.
You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but
retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also gain all
extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict, improved
grab, and poison) but do not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed
by the new form (such as blindsense, fast healing, regeneration, and scent) or
any supernatural, psionic, or spelllike abilities.</div><div>You retain all
supernatural and spell-like special attacks and special qualities of your
normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not
have, if any. You keep all extraordinary special attacks and special qualities
derived from class levels, but you lose any benefits of the racial traits of
your normal form. If you have a template, special abilities it provides are
likewise not retained. If the assumed form is capable of speech, you can
communicate normally. You retain any manifesting ability you had in your original
form.</div><div>You acquire the
physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical
qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as
burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum
speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor
bonus, natural weapons (such as claws or a bite), racial bonuses on skill
checks, racial bonus feats, and any anatomical qualities (presence or absence
of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does
not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks)
than normal.</div><div>You can freely
designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair
texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type.
The new form’s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and
gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for
the new form’s species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of
the new form’s race. If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10
bonus on your Disguise check.</div><div>When the change
occurs, your equipment either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is
capable of wearing or holding the item in question) or melds into the new form
and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your normal form, any objects
previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body
they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore
in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal form fall off and land at
your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part
common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are
still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is
separated from the whole reverts to its normal form.</div><div>You can also
use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object. You gain the object’s
hardness and retain your own hit points. You can take the shape of almost any
simple object you can think of. If you attempt to take the form of a complex
object, you must make an appropriate skill check.. If you fail the check, your
manifestation of the power does not succeed. Likewise, you cannot take the form
of a complex mechanical mechanism unless you have some sort of skill associated
with the object. You cannot use this power to assume the form of a psionic item
or a magic item, or any object with a hardness of 15 or higher. You also cannot
take the form of a psionically animated mechanism or any object formed of
ectoplasm.</div><div>As an inanimate
object, you lose all mobility. You retain your normal senses and your ability
to speak. You can manifest a power if you make a Concentration check (DC 20 +
power level); however, doing so ends the duration of this power. If you take
damage while in the form of an object, your actual body also takes damage (but
the object’s hardness, if any, protects you).</div><br><h3 id="metamorphosis-greater">Metamorphosis, Greater</h3><div>Psychometabolism</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level:</span><span> Egoist 9</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Display:</span><span> Material and visual</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifesting

the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is not required to answer the question;
however, making a save does not end the power. You can ask the subject a new

they are somehow hindered. You pose the questions telepathically, and the
answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the

constructs and summoned creatures wink out if they enter a <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics

winked out counts normally against the duration of the power that is
maintaining the construct or summoned creature.</div><div>Creation powers

creature (a normally encountered construct rather than a created one, for
instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a
psionic sword does not function psionically within the area, it is still a
sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The power has no effect on golems and
other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and
are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned or have a
limited duration, in which case they are treated like any other summoned
creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected
unless summoned. These creatures’ spell-like or supernatural abilities,
however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Dispel
psionics </span><span>does not remove the field. Two or more <span style="font-style: italic;">null

Certain powers may be unaffected by <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics field </span>(see the
individual power descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal
power such as this. Should a creature’s space extend across the boundary of the
area enclosed by the field, any part of the creature that lies outside the
effect is unaffected by the field.</span></div><br><h3 id="oak-body">Oak Body</h3><div>Psychometabolism</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level:</span><span> Psion/wilder 7, psychic warrior 5</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Display:</span><span> Auditory</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifesting

enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of some monsters. This
ability allows you to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and
track by sense of smell. With the scent ability, you can identify familiar
odors just as humanoids do familiar sights<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></div><div>You can detect
opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the
range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents,
such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted
above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be
detected at triple normal range.</div><div>When you detect
a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence
somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the
scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source’s
location.</div><div>If you have the
Track feat, you can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check
to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter
what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending
on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the
trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability
otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. If you are tracking with <span style="font-style: italic;">psionic
scent, </span>you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.</div><br><h3 id="psychic-chirurgery">Psychic Chirurgery</h3><div>Telepathy
