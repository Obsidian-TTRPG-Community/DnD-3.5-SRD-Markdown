bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-ounce dollop of thick, gooey
material called quintessence. This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when
viewed from some angles but is transparent from other viewpoints. You can
smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object.</div><div>Objects sealed
within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms,
they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with
quintessence is also partially pulled out of the time stream (the manifester is
immune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of damage per round
beginning 10 rounds after partial contact occurs.</div><div>Quintessence
can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the
time stream. When you do this, there is a 75% chance that the quintessence
evaporates back into the continuum. Otherwise, it coalesces again into a
1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.</div><div>Large
quantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to preserve large
items or structures (or even a complete living creature; if completely immersed,
a living creature would not take the damage associated with partial contact).
However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because
accumulations of quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity
within a 5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers require twice as many power
points to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save each
time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances,
manifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at will is a full-round action
rather than a standard action.</div><br><h3 id="read-thoughts">Read Thoughts</h3><div>Telepathy

animal intelligence have simple, instinctual thoughts that you can pick up. If
you read the thoughts of a creature with an Intelligence of 26 or higher (and
at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score), you are stunned for

1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of

produce any one of the following effects.</div><div>• Duplicate any
psion power of 8th level or lower, provided the power is not prohibited to you.</div><div>• Duplicate any
other power (but not a spell) of 6th level or lower, such as a psychic warrior
power.</div><div>• Duplicate any
psion power of 7th level or lower even if it’s a power prohibited to you.</div><div>• Undo the
harmful effects of many other powers, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">microcosm, geas/quest, </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">insanity</span>.</div><div>• Create a
nonpsionic item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</div><div>• Create a
psionic item, or add to the powers of an existing psionic item (see XP cost
below).</div><div>• Grant a
creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <span style="font-style: italic;">reality
revisions </span>manifested in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to
+5 inherent bonus to an ability score. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so
they cannot be negated or dispelled. An inherent bonus cannot exceed +5 for a
single ability score. Inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not
stack; only the best one applies.</div><div>• Remove
injuries and afflictions. A single <span style="font-style: italic;">reality revision </span>can aid one creature
per manifester level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of
affliction. </div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Reality
revision </span><span>can not restore the experience point loss
from manifesting a power or casting a spell, or the level or&nbsp; Constitution
loss from being returned to life by those effects that reduce level or
Constitution.</span></div><div>• Revive the
dead. <span style="font-style: italic;">Reality revision </span>can bring a dead creature back to life by
duplicating a <span style="font-style: italic;">resurrection </span>spell. This power can revive a dead creature
whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two manifestations of <span style="font-style: italic;">reality
revision</span>, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life
again. <span style="font-style: italic;">Reality revision </span>cannot prevent a character who is brought back
to life from losing a level.</div><div>• Transport
travelers. This power can lift one creature per manifester level from anywhere
on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of
local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect,
and power resistance (if any) applies.</div><div>• Undo
misfortune. <span style="font-style: italic;">Reality revision </span>can undo a single recent event. Manifesting
the power forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including
your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. The
reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling
target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any)
applies.</div><div>You can try to
use <span style="font-style: italic;">reality revision </span>to produce more powerful effects than these, but
doing so is dangerous. The manifestation may pervert your intent into a literal
but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.</div><div>Duplicated
powers allow saves and power resistance as normal (but save DCs are calculated
as though the power is 9th level).</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">XP Cost: </span><span>The minimum XP cost for manifesting <span style="font-style: italic;">reality revision </span>is 5,000</span></div><div>XP. When a
manifestation duplicates a power that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or
that cost, whichever is more. When a manifestation creates or improves a
psionic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving
the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.</div><br><h3 id="recall-agony">Recall Agony</h3><div>Clairsentience

for at least 24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know
