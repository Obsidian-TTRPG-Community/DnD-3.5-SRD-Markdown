Open Game License v1.0a.</div><h2 id="divine-minions">DIVINE MINIONS</h2><br><div>All types of
beings may serve deities. In general, a deity only accepts minions who have
accomplished some great deed in service to the deity. Such minions usually have
the same alignment as the deity. No minion’s alignment is opposed to the patron
deity’s alignment on either the law–chaos axis or the good–evil axis. </div><br><h3 id="proxies">Proxies</h3><div>A divine proxy
speaks and acts on behalf of the divine being. When the demand for a deity’s
presence is too high, the deity may use proxies.</div><div>Proxies are divine
minions invested with a small portion of the deity’s power. A deity may invest
1 rank of its power (reducing its divine rank accordingly) in a single servant
for as long as the deity chooses. The minion must be physically present for the
deity to perform the investiture. While so invested, the proxy gains any
salient divine abilities held by the patron deity as well as the powers and
abilities of a rank 1 demigod. Without the requisite ability scores or divine
ranks, the proxy may not be able to use all those powers and abilities. A deity
may have more than one proxy, but it must lose 1 divine rank for each proxy it
invests. A deity can retrieve a single divine rank as a standard action, and
doing so it does not require the physical presence of the proxy. </div><br><h3 id="petitioners">Petitioners</h3><div>Some spirits
demonstrate their devotion to their deity by traveling to the deity’s home
plane. Those that survive the journey across the planes become servants of
their deity. While a few may remain disembodied spirits, most become
petitioners through the divine will of their patron deity. </div><div>In general,
petitioners appear in the form that they had when they died, though they may be
remade by deities to fit the nature of their particular afterlife. In general,
petitioners who become divine servants are creatures that originally had at
least 1 Intelligence and 1 Wisdom.</div><div>The following
creature types may become petitioners depending on the deity: aberrations,
animals, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids,
and plants, oozes, and vermin with sufficient ability scores. Constructs and
undead are not usually made into petitioners, though the spirits of their
original forms may be. Elementals and outsiders tend to meld with their native
planes, and as such do not become petitioners. Their spirits may still be
called back from the dead, however.</div><div>The template
presented below is for NPCs, not player characters. If dead characters who are
petitioners are later restored to life (once again becoming player characters),
they forget any of their experiences as petitioners.</div><br><h3 id="creating-a-petitioner">Creating a Petitioner</h3><div>“Petitioner” is a
template that may be added to any creature as determined by the nature of the
campaign (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature’s type
changes to outsider, and the creature uses all the base creature’s statistics
and special abilities except as noted here.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Hit Dice: </span><span>Change to 2d8. Retain bonus hit points.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">AC:</span><span> Natural Armor Class, Dexterity, and size

immunities are applied similarly to all petitioners of a particular plane or

their plane.</div></div></body></html>
