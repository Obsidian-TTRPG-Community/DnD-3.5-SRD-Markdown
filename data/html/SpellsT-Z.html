Time:</span><span> 1
standard action</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Range:</span><span> Long (400 ft. + 40
ft./level)</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Target
or Targets:</span><span>
See text</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Duration:</span><span> Concentration (up to 1
round/ level) or instantaneous; see text</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Saving
Throw: </span><span>Will
negates (object) or None; see text</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Resistance:</span><span>
Yes (object); see text</span></div><div>You
move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version
selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of
combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Sustained
Force: </span><span>A
sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster
level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature
can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or
with spell resistance.</span></div><div>This
version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you
cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in
both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if
the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any
reason, the object falls or stops.</div><div>An
object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a
lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on,
if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able
to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require
Intelligence checks.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Combat
Maneuver: </span><span>Alternatively,
once per round, you can use <span style="font-style: italic;">telekinesis </span>to perform a bull rush, disarm,
grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that
they don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place
of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence
modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your
Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive
attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against
these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell
can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Violent
Thrust: </span><span>Alternatively,
the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or
creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10
feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the
objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level
(maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</span></div><div>You
must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the
target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence
modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause
standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage
as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage
ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points
of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</div><div>Creatures
who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are
allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those
whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is
hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet
(1d6 points).</div><br><h3 id="telekinetic-sphere">Telekinetic Sphere</h3><div>Evocation

Throw:</span><span>
Reflex negates (object)</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Resistance:</span><span>
Yes (object)</span></div><div>This
spell functions like <span style="font-style: italic;">resilient sphere, </span>with the addition that the
creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained
within an <span style="font-style: italic;">telekinetic sphere </span>weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal
weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally
weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to
medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has
succeeded in encapsulating its contents.</div><div>You
can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds
or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the
round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard
action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease
concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface)
or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or
the spell’s duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease
concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can
resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell’s
duration.</div><div>The
sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to
cause damage to the contents of the sphere.</div><div>You
can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Material

hemispherical piece of clear crystal, a matching hemispherical piece of gum
arabic, and a pair of small bar magnets.</span></div><br><h3 id="telepathic-bond">Telepathic Bond</h3><div>Divination</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level:</span><span> Sor/Wiz 5</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Components:</span><span> V, S, M</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Casting

No</span></div><div>You
forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each
of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included
in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate
telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence
is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over
any distance (although not from one plane to another).</div><div>If
desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This
decision must be made at the time of casting.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Telepathic
bond </span><span>can
be made permanent with a <span style="font-style: italic;">permanency </span>spell, though it only bonds two
creatures per casting of <span style="font-style: italic;">permanency</span>.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Material

standard action</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Range:</span><span> Personal and touch</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Target:</span><span> You and touched objects

None and Will negates (object)</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Resistance:</span><span>
No and Yes (object)</span></div><div>This
spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as
distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You
can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum
load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature
(carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below)
per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a
Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be
transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those
creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is
personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell
resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another
person receive saving throws and spell resistance.</div><div>You
must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The
clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of
strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even
impossible.</div><div>To
see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table.
Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Familiarity:
</span><span>“Very
familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.
“Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently
see it, you’ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">scrying</span>)
to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that you
have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed
once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. </span></div><div>“False
destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to
an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so
completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a
false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than
rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or
even be off target from.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">On
Target: </span><span>You
appear where you want to be.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Off
Target: </span><span>You
appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random
direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be
traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Similar
Area: </span><span>You
wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.</span></div><div>Generally,
you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists
within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Mishap:
</span><span>You and
anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10
points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For
these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take
more damage and must reroll.</span></div><div class="table-container"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px none rgb(128, 128, 128); width: 34.2em; padding: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 13.6em;">Familiarity</td><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 4.72em;">On Target</td><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 4.42em;">Off Target</td><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 4.57em;">Similar Area</td><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 3.22em;">Mishap</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 15.1em;">Very

itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5

a creature’s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the

Completion: </span><span>First,
the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as
if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell
resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature’s name
is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by
2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Trigger
Object: </span><span>The
second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a
trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the
creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s name and
the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is
enspelled. A <span style="font-style: italic;">sympathy </span>spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As
soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is
automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or
a save.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Material
Component: </span><span>Before
the actual casting of <span style="font-style: italic;">trap the soul, </span>you must procure a gem of at least

the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted.

can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Focus

cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself
into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The
wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges
to fit the available space.</div><div>A
<span style="font-style: italic;">wall of iron </span>is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the
wall’s area by halving its thickness. Each 5- foot square of the wall has 30
hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit
points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall
with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of
thickness.</div><div>If
you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but
not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush
creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left
unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it
fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall
over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making
successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points
of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.</div><div>Like

5-foot square per level. You can double the wall’s area by halving its

a <span style="font-style: italic;">wall of iron, </span>you can create a <span style="font-style: italic;">wall of stone </span>in almost any

foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing
stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this
use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. The wall can be crudely
shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing
the area.</div><div>Like
any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <span style="font-style: italic;">disintegrate </span>spell

<span style="font-style: italic;">wall of thorns </span>spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled
brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human’s finger. Any creature
forced into or attempting to move through a <span style="font-style: italic;">wall of thorns </span>takes
slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature’s AC.
Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures
with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge
bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)</div><div>You
can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall
as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This
has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to
break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</div><div>Creatures
can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a
full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature
moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of
course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as
described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain
motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.</div><div>Any
creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had
moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt
to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the
ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <span style="font-style: italic;">wall
of thorns </span>at normal speed without taking damage.</div><div>A
<span style="font-style: italic;">wall of thorns </span>can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping
away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of
work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10
minutes.</div><div>Despite

Yes</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Wish
</span><span>is the
mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you
can alter reality to better suit you.</span></div><div>Even
<span style="font-style: italic;">wish</span>, however, has its limits.</div><div>A
<span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>can produce any one of the following effects.</div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Duplicate any wizard or
sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school
prohibited to you.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Duplicate any other spell
of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Duplicate any wizard or
sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Duplicate any other spell
of 5th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Undo the harmful effects
of many other spells, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">geas/quest </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">insanity</span>.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Create a nonmagical item
of up to 25,000 gp in value.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Create a magic item, or
add to the powers of an existing magic item.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Grant a creature a +1
inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>spells cast in
immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an
ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent
bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be
dispelled. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single
ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack,
so only the best one applies.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Remove injuries and
afflictions. A single <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>can aid one creature per caster level, and
all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could
heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison
effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <span style="font-style: italic;">wish</span>.
A <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell
or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Revive the dead. A <span style="font-style: italic;">wish
</span>can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a <span style="font-style: italic;">resurrection </span>spell.
A <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the
task takes two <span style="font-style: italic;">wishes, </span>one to recreate the body and another to infuse
the body with life again. A <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>cannot prevent a character who was
brought back to life from losing an experience level.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Transport travelers. A <span style="font-style: italic;">wish
</span>can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place
those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An
unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance
(if any) applies.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">• </span><span>Undo misfortune. A <span style="font-style: italic;">wish
</span>can undo a single recent event. The <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>forces a reroll of any roll
made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself
to accommodate the new result. For example, a <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>could undo an
opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the attack
roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on. The reroll,
however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target
gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</span></div><div>You
may try to use a <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>to produce greater effects than these, but doing
so is dangerous. (The <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>may pervert your intent into a literal but
undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)</div><div>Duplicated
spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for
9th-level spells).</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Material
Component: </span><span>When
a <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than
10,000 gp, you must provide that component.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">XP
Cost: </span><span>The
minimum XP cost for casting <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>is 5,000 XP. When a <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>duplicates
a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is
more. When a <span style="font-style: italic;">wish </span>creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice
the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000
XP.</span></div><br><h3 id="wood-shape">Wood Shape</h3><div>Transmutation</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level:</span><span> Drd 2</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Components:</span><span> V, S, DF</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Casting
