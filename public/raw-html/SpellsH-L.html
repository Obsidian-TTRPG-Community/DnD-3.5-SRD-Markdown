effects.</span></p><p>First,
the site or structure is guarded by a <span style="font-style: italic;">magic circle against evil </span>effect.</p><p>Second,
all Charisma checks made to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus, and Charisma
checks to command undead take a –4 penalty. Spell resistance does not apply to
this effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.)</p><p>Third,

undead creature.</p><p>Finally,
you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the <span style="font-style: italic;">hallowed </span>site. The spell
effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless
of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect
applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or
creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the
chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting <span style="font-style: italic;">hallow

effects that may be tied to a <span style="font-style: italic;">hallowed </span>site include <span style="font-style: italic;">aid, bane, bless,

detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements,
freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear,

darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.
If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the
subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do
so.</p><p>Items
dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up
disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light,
however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so
(thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an
item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it
becomes visible.</p><p>Of
course, the subject is not magically <span style="font-style: italic;">silenced, </span>and certain other
conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).
The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell,
an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a
foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.)
Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm
indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk,
eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding
a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a
portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks
directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.
