AND POWERS</h1><section id="h3-1-divine-ranks"><h3>Divine Ranks</h3><p>Each deity has a
divine rank. A deity’s divine rank determines how much power the entity has.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rank 0:</span><span> Creatures of this rank are sometimes
called quasi-deities or hero deities. Creatures that have a mortal and a deity
as parents also fall into this category. These entities cannot grant spells,
but are immortal and usually have one or more ability</span></p><p>scores that are
far above the norm for their species. They may have some worshipers. Ordinary
mortals do not have a divine rank of 0. They lack a divine rank altogether.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rank 1–5:</span><span> These entities, called demigods, are the
weakest of the deities. A demigod can grant spells and perform a few deeds that
are beyond mortal limits. A demigod has anywhere from a few hundred to a few
thousand devoted mortal worshipers and may receive veneration or respect from
many more. A demigod controls a small godly realm (usually on an Outer Plane)
and has minor control over a portfolio that includes one or more aspects of
mortal existence. A demigod might be very accomplished in a single skill or a
group of related skills, gain combat advantages in special circumstances, or be
able to bring about minor changes in reality itself related to the portfolio.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rank 6–10:</span><span> Called lesser deities, these entities
grant spells and can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can. Lesser
deities have anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of worshipers
and control larger godly realms than demigods. They also have keener senses
where their portfolios are concerned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rank 11–15:</span><span> These entities are called intermediate
deities. They have hundreds of thousands of mortal worshipers and control
larger godly realms than demigods or lesser deities. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rank 16–20:</span><span> Called greater deities, these entities may
have millions of mortal worshipers, and they command respect even among other
deities. The most powerful of greater deities rule over other deities just as
mortal sovereigns rule over commoners.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rank 21+:</span><span> These entities are beyond the ken of
mortals and care nothing for worshipers. They do not grant spells, do not
answer prayers, and do not respond to queries. If they are known at all, it is
to a handful of scholars on the Material Plane. They are called overdeities. In
some pantheistic systems, the consent of an overdeity is required to become a
god.</span><span>25</span></p></section><section id="h3-2-divine-characteristics"><h3>Divine Characteristics</h3><p>Most deities are
creatures of the outsider type (usually with 20 outsider Hit Dice). All deities
that are outsiders have all alignment subtypes that correspond with their
alignment.&nbsp; Unlike other outsiders, they have no darkvision unless noted
in the deity description. Deities’ physical characteristics vary from deity to
deity. A deity’s outsider type, along with its class or classes, determines its
weapon proficiencies, feats, and skills. Deities have some or all of the
following additional qualities, depending on their divine rank.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Levels:</span><span> Most deities are 20 HD outsiders with 30
to 50 character levels as well. These additional character levels beyond an
effective character level of 20th follow the rules for epic levels.</span></p><p>Character levels
above 20th confer some, but not all, of the benefits of normal levels. Deities
gain all the class features for all their levels. The deity also gains the
normal Hit Die for that class, plus additional skill points as if the deity had
a level in that class normally. The deity gains an ability bonus every four
levels, and a feat every three levels.</p><p>Beyond character
level 20th, deities’ attack and saving throw bonuses increase at new rates.
Deities gain a +1 epic attack bonus at 21st level and every other level
thereafter. No deity can have more than four attacks derived strictly from its
base attack bonus.&nbsp; Deities also gain a +1 bonus on saving throws at 22nd
level and every other level thereafter.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Hit Points:</span><span> Deities receive maximum hit points for
each Hit Die.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Speed:</span><span> Deities can move much more quickly than
mortals. A deity’s base land speed depends on its form (biped or quadruped) and
its size, as shown on the following table. Some deities are exceptions, with
speeds faster or slower than the norm.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 18.9em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none;

Biped column for burrow and swim speeds for all deities regardless of form. Use
half the value in the Biped column for climb speeds for all deities. Use twice
the value in the Quadruped column for fly speeds for all deities capable of
flying.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Armor Class:</span><span> A field of divine energy encompasses a
deity’s body, granting it a divine Armor Class bonus equal to its divine rank.
This bonus stacks with all other Armor Class bonuses and is effective against
touch attacks and incorporeal touch attacks.</span></p><p>Most deities (all
those with 20 outsider Hit Dice) have a natural armor bonus of their divine
rank +13. All deities also have a deflection bonus to their AC equal to their
Charisma bonus (if any).</p><p>Deities who aren’t
outsiders have their normal natural armor bonus + their divine rank.</p><p>Many deities have
other Armor Class bonuses as noted in their individual descriptions.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Attacks:</span><span> A deity’s Hit Dice and type and character
level determine its base attack bonus. In addition to the figures for weapon
attacks, this section of the statistics block also includes melee touch attack
and ranged touch attack bonuses, to be used when the deity casts a spell or
uses a spell-like ability that requires a touch attack to affect its target. A
deity gets its divine rank as a divine bonus on all attack rolls. Deities of
rank 1 or higher do not automatically fail on a natural attack roll of 1.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Bypassing
Damage Reduction:</span><span> As
outsiders with alignment subtypes, the natural attacks of deities, as well as
any weapons they wield, are considered aligned the same as the deity for the
purposes of bypassing damage reduction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Always Maximize
Roll:</span><span> Greater deities
(rank 16–20) automatically get the best result possible on any check, saving
throw, attack roll, or damage roll. Calculate success, failure, or other
effects accordingly. When a greater deity makes a check, attack, or save assume
a 20 was rolled and calculate success or failure from there. A d20 should still
be rolled and used to check for a threat of a critical hit.&nbsp; This quality
means that greater deities never need the Maximize Spell feat, because their
spells have maximum effect already.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Saving Throws:</span><span> A deity’s outsider Hit Dice and character
level determine its base saving throw bonuses. A deity gets its divine rank as
a divine bonus on all saving throws. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not
automatically fail on a natural saving throw roll of 1.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Checks:</span><span> A deity gets its divine rank as a divine
bonus on all skill checks, ability checks, caster level checks, and turning
checks. Lesser deities (rank 6–10) may take 10 on any check, provided they need
to make a check at all. Intermediate and greater deities (rank 11–20) always
get a result of 20 on any check, provided they need to make a check at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Deities and Synergy Bonuses</span><span>: For every 20 extra
ranks a deity has in a skill, the deity’s synergy bonus from the skill (if any)
increases by +2.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Immunities:</span><span> Deities have the following immunities.
Individual deities may have more immunities. Unless otherwise indicated, these
immunities do not apply if the attacker is a deity of equal or higher rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Transmutation: </span><span>A deity is immune to polymorphing,
petrification, or any other attack that alters its form. Any shape-altering
powers the deity might have work normally on itself.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Energy Drain,
Ability Drain, Ability Damage: </span><span>A deity is not subject to energy drain, ability drain, or ability
damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Mind-Affecting
Effects: </span><span>A deity is immune
to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale
effects).</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Energy
Immunity: </span><span>Deities of rank
1 or higher are immune to electricity, cold, and acid, even if the attacker is
a deity of higher divine rank. Some deities have additional energy immunities.</span></p><p>Deities of rank 1
or higher are immune to disease and poison, stunning, sleep, paralysis, and
death effects, and disintegration.</p><p>Deities of rank 6
or higher are immune to effects that imprison or banish them. Such effects
include <span style="font-style: italic;">banishment, binding, dimensional anchor, dismissal, imprisonment,
repulsion, soul bind, temporal stasis, trap the soul, </span>and turning and
rebuking.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Damage
Reduction:</span><span> A deity has
damage reduction as shown below</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 22.5001em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Divine Rank</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Damage Reduction</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Quasi-deity (0)</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">10/epic</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Demigod (1-5)</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">15/epic</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">Lesser deity

  (16-20)</td><td style="border: none; vertical-align: top;">30/epic</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>If the deity also
has damage reduction from another source this damage reduction does not stack
with the damage reduction granted by divine ranks. Instead, the deity gets the
benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation. Whenever a deity has
a second kind of damage reduction that might apply to an attack, that damage
reduction is listed in parentheses after the damage reduction entry in the
deity’s statistics block.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Resistances:</span><span> All deities have at least the following
resistances.&nbsp; Individual deities may have additional resistances.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Energy
Resistance: </span><span>A deity has
fire resistance of 5 + its divine rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spell
Resistance: </span><span>A deity has
spell resistance of 32 + its divine rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Salient Divine
Abilities</span><span>: Every deity of
rank 1 or higher has at least one additional power, called a salient divine
ability, per divine rank (see Salient Divine Abilities).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Domain Powers:</span><span> A deity of rank 1 or higher can use any
domain power it can grant a number of times per day equal to its divine rank
(if the power normally can be used more often than that, the deity gets the
greater number of uses). If a domain power is based on a cleric’s level (or
one-half a cleric’s level), a deity with no cleric levels has an effective cleric
level equal to the deity’s divine rank (or one-half the deity’s divine rank)
for this purpose.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell-Like
Abilities:</span><span> A deity can use
any domain spell it can grant as a spell-like ability at will. The deity’s
effective caster level for such abilities is 10 + the deity’s divine rank. The
saving throw DC for such abilities is 10 + the spell level + the deity’s
Charisma bonus (if any) + the deity’s divine rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Immortality:</span><span> All deities (even those of rank 0) are
naturally immortal and cannot die from natural causes. Deities do not age, and
they do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. The only way for a deity to die is
through special circumstances, usually by being slain in magical or physical
combat. Deities of rank 1 or higher are not subject to death from massive
damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Senses: </span><span>Deities of rank 1 or higher have incredibly
sensitive perception. Such a deity’s senses (including darkvision and low-light
vision, if the deity has them) extend out to a radius of one mile per divine
rank. Perception is limited to the senses a deity possesses. </span><span>A deity cannot see through
</span><span>solid objects without using
its remote sensing ability or some sort of x-ray vision power.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Remote Sensing:
</span><span>As a standard action, a
deity of rank 1 or higher can perceive everything within a radius of one mile
per rank around any of its worshipers, holy sites, or other objects or locales
sacred to the deity. This supernatural effect can also be centered on any place
where someone speaks the deity’s name or title for up to 1 hour after the name
is spoken, and at any location when an event related to the deity’s portfolio
occurs.The remote sensing power can cross planes and penetrate any barrier
except a divine shield (described in Salient Divine Abilities) or an area
otherwise blocked by a deity of equal or higher rank. Remote sensing is not
fooled by <span style="font-style: italic;">misdirection </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">nondetection </span>or similar spells, and it
does not create a magical sensor that other creatures can detect. A deity can
extend its senses to two or more remote locations at once (depending on divine
rank) and still sense what’s going on nearby.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 15.75em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Divine Rank</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Remote Locations</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">1–5</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; vertical-align: top;">2</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">6–10</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; vertical-align: top;">5</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">11–15</td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; vertical-align: top;">10</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border: none; vertical-align: top;">16–20</td><td style="border: none; text-align: center; vertical-align: top;">20</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Once a deity
chooses a remote location to sense, it automatically receives sensory
information from that location until it chooses a new location to sense, or
until it can’t sense the location.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Block Sensing: </span><span>As a standard action, a deity of rank 1 or
higher can block the sensing ability of other deities of its rank or lower.
This power extends for a radius of one mile per rank of the deity, or within
the same distance around a temple or other locale sacred to the deity, or the
same distance around a portfolio-related event. The deity can block two remote
locations at once, plus the area within one mile of itself. The blockage lasts
1 hour per divine rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Portfolio: </span><span>Every deity of rank 1 or higher has at
least limited knowledge and control over some aspect of mortal existence. A
deity’s connection to its portfolio gives it a number of powers.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Portfolio
Sense: </span><span>Demigods have a
limited ability to sense events involving their portfolios. They automatically
sense any event that involves one thousand or more people. The ability is
limited to the present. Lesser deities automatically sense any event that
involves their portfolios and affects five hundred or more people. Intermediate
deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios,
regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend
one week into the past for every divine rank they have. Greater deities
automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the
number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the
past and one week into the future for every divine rank they have. When a deity
senses an event, it merely knows that the event is occurring and where it is.
The deity receives no sensory information about the event. Once a deity notices
an event, it can use its remote sensing power to perceive the event.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Automatic
Actions: </span><span>When performing
an action within its portfolio, a deity can perform any action as a free

higher can deeply affect mortals and beings of lower divine rank. All divine
aura effects are mind-affecting, extraordinary abilities. Mortals and other
deities of lower rank can resist the aura’s effects with successful Will saves;
the DC is 10 + the deity’s rank + the deity’s Charisma modifier. Deities are
immune to the auras of deities of equal or lower rank. Any being who makes a
successful saving throw against a deity’s aura power becomes immune to that
deity’s aura power for one day. Divine aura is an emanation that extends around
the deity in a radius whose size is a function of divine rank. The deity
chooses the size of the radius and can change it as a free action. If the deity
chooses a radius of 0 feet, its aura power effectively becomes non-functional.
When two or more deities’ auras cover the same area, only the aura that belongs
to the deity with the highest rank functions. If divine ranks are equal, the
auras coexist.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 15.075em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Divine Rank </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: right; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Divine Aura Size</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">1–5 </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: right; vertical-align: top;">10 ft./rank</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">6–10 </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: right; vertical-align: top;">100 ft./rank</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;">11–15 </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: right; vertical-align: top;">100 ft./rank</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border: none; vertical-align: top;">16–20 </td><td style="border: none; text-align: right; vertical-align: top;">1 mile/rank</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The deity can make
its own worshipers, beings of its alignment, or both types of individuals
immune to the effect as a free action. The immunity lasts one day or until the

as long as they remain within the aura’s radius. The deity can choose from the

bonus on attack rolls, saves, and checks, while the deity’s foes receive a –4
morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Grant Spells: </span><span>A deity automatically grants spells and
domain powers to mortal divine spellcasters who pray to it. Most deities can
grant spells from the cleric spell list, the ranger spell list, and from three
or more domains. Deities with levels in the druid class can grant spells from
the druid spell list, and deities with paladin levels can grant spells from the
paladin spell list. A deity can withhold spells from any particular mortal as a
free action; once a spell has been granted, it remains in the mortal’s mind
until expended.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spontaneous
Casting:</span><span> A deity of rank 1
or higher who has levels in a divine spellcasting class can spontaneously cast
any spell it can grant. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Communication:</span><span> A deity of rank 1 or higher can
understand, speak, and read any language, including nonverbal languages. The
deity can speak directly to any beings within one mile of itself per divine
rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Remote
Communication: </span><span>As a
standard action, a deity of rank 1 or higher can send a communication to a
remote location. The deity can speak to any of its own worshipers, and to
anyone within one mile per rank away from a site dedicated to the deity, or
within one mile per rank away from a statue or other likeness of the deity. The
creature being contacted can receive a telepathic message that only it can
hear. Alternatively, the deity’s voice can seem to issue from the air, the
ground, or from some object of the deity’s choosing (but not an object or
locale dedicated to another deity of equal or higher rank than the deity who is
speaking). In the latter case, anyone within earshot of the sound can hear it.
The deity can send a manifestation or omen instead of a spoken or telepathic
message. The exact nature of this communication varies with the deity, but it
usually is some visible phenomenon. A deity’s communication power can cross
planes and penetrate any barrier. Once communication is initiated, the deity
can continue communicating as a free action until it decides to end the
communication. A deity can carry on as many remote communications at one time
as it can remote sense at one time (see Remote Sensing, above).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Godly Realm:</span><span> Each deity of rank 1 or higher has a
location that serves as a workplace, personal residence, audience chamber, and
sometimes as a retreat or fortress. A deity is at its most powerful within its
godly realm. A deity has at least modest control over the environment within
its realm, controlling the temperature and minor elements of the environment.
The radius of this control is a function of the deity’s rank and whether the
realm is located on an Outer Plane or some other plane (including the Material
Plane).</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 23.4751em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Divine Rank</td><td colspan="2" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; text-align: center; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">——— Radius of Control ———</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; vertical-align: top;"></td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Outer Plane </td><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Material

the deity can set any temperature that is normal for the plane where the realm
is located (for the Material Plane, any temperature from –20ºF to 120ºF), and
fill the area with scents and sounds as the deity sees fit. Sounds can be no louder
than one hundred humans could make, but not intelligible speech or harmful
sound. The deity’s ability to create scents is similar. Deities of rank 6 or
higher can create the sounds of intelligible speech. A demigod or lesser deity
can erect buildings and alter the landscape, but must do so through its own
labor, through magic, or through its divine powers. A deity of rank 6 or higher
not only has control over the environment, but also controls links to the
Astral Plane. Manipulating a realm’s astral links renders teleportation and
similar effects useless within the realm. The deity can designate certain
locales within the realm where astral links remain intact. Likewise, the deity
can block off the realm from planar portals or designate locations where portals
are possible. A deity of rank 11 or higher can also apply the enhanced magic or
impeded magic trait to up to four groups of spells (schools, domains, or spells
with the same descriptor). The enhanced magic trait enables a metamagic feat to
be applied to a group of spells without requiring higher-level spell slots.
Many deities apply the enhanced magic trait to their domain spells, making them
maximized (as the Maximize Spell feat) within the boundaries of their realm.
The impeded magic trait doesn’t affect the deity’s spells and spell-like
abilities.</p><p>In addition, a
deity of rank 11 or higher can erect buildings as desired and alter terrain
within ten miles to become any terrain type found on the Material Plane. These
buildings and alterations are manifestations of the deity’s control over the
realm.</p><p>A greater deity
(rank 16 or higher) also can perform any one of the following acts:</p><p>• Change or apply
a gravity trait within the realm.</p><p>• Change or apply
an elemental or energy trait within the realm.</p><p>• Change or apply
a time trait within the realm.</p><p>• Apply the
limited magic trait to a particular school, domain, or spell descriptor within
the area, preventing such spells and spell-like abilities from functioning. The
greater deity’s own spells and spell-like abilities are not limited by these
restrictions.</p><p>Once a deity sets
the conditions in its realm, they are permanent, though the deity can change
them. As a standard action, the deity can specify a new environmental
condition. The change gradually takes effect over the next 10 minutes. Changing
astral links, planar traits, or terrain requires more effort, and the deity
must labor for a year and a day to change them. During this time, the deity
must spend 8 hours a day on the project. During the remaining 16 hours of each
day, the deity can perform any action it desires, so long as it remains within
the realm. The astral links, planar traits, and terrain remain unchanged until
the labor is complete. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Travel:</span><span> A deity of rank 1 or higher can use <span style="font-style: italic;">teleport
without error </span>as a spell-like ability at will, as the spell cast by a
20th-level character, except that the deity can transport only itself and up to
100 pounds of objects per divine rank. A deity of rank 6 or higher also can use
<span style="font-style: italic;">plane shift </span>as a spell-like ability at will, as the spell cast by a
20th-level character, except that the deity can only transport itself and up to
100 pounds of objects. If the deity has a familiar, personal mount, or personal
intelligent weapon, the creature can accompany the deity in any mode of travel
if the deity touches it. The creature’s weight counts against the deity’s
weight limit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Familiar:</span><span> A deity of rank 1 or higher with levels as
a sorcerer or a wizard has the ability to treat any creature of a given kind as
a familiar, as long as that creature is within a distance of one mile per
divine rank of the deity. This special familiar ability only applies to one
creature at a time, but the deity can switch between one creature and another
instantaneously, as long as the second creature is within range. This special
familiar ability does not replace the deity’s ability to have a normal
familiar, which could be any kind of eligible creature.</span></p></section></section></body></html>
