affected creatures or objects fall slowly. <span style="font-style: italic;">Feather fall </span>instantly
changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round
(equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no
damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell
duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.</p><p>The
spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and
carried objects up to each creature’s maximum load) or objects, or the
equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium
creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures
or objects, and so forth.</p><p>You
can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself
if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a
quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell
per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn’t your turn.</p><p>This
spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a
distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal
damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Feather
fall </span><span>works
only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging

acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire
damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any

successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck
directly is not allowed a saving throw.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Holly
Berry Bombs: </span><span>You
turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are
usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown
weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak
a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points
of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot radius

a <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional
connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing
travel between those two planes in either direction.</p><p>Second,
you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <span style="font-style: italic;">gate.</span></p><p>The
<span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter
(caster’s choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into
existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window
looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or
anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.</p><p>A
<span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>from
the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from
the back are not.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Planar
Travel: </span><span>As
a mode of planar travel, a <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>spell functions much like a <span style="font-style: italic;">plane
shift </span>spell, except that the <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>opens precisely at the point you
desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm
can prevent a <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>from opening in their presence or personal demesnes
if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to
step through the portal is transported. A <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>cannot be opened to
another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</span></p><p>You
may hold the <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per
caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar
connection is severed.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Calling
Creatures: </span><span>The
second effect of the <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>spell is to call an extraplanar creature to
your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as
you cast the spell, you cause the <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>to open in the immediate vicinity
of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling.
Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <span style="font-style: italic;">gate, </span>although
they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <span style="font-style: italic;">gate
</span>that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This
use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</span></p><p>If
you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may
call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call
and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your
caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do
not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice
your caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be
controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the
calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to
its home plane at any time.</p><p>A
controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such
services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service.
Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be
accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you
need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature’s help. The
creature departs at the end of the spell.</p><p>If
you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called
creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The
service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or
reward; see the <span style="font-style: italic;">lesser planar ally </span>spell for appropriate rewards. (Some
creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which
could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the
being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over
the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to
return to its own plane.</p><p>Failure
to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service
by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the
creature or its kin may attack you.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:
</span><span>When you
use a calling spell such as <span style="font-style: italic;">gate </span>to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil,
fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">XP

trap a chest or box, and so on.</p><p>You
set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded
area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set
when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in
addition to a password trigger, <span style="font-style: italic;">glyphs </span>can be set according to physical
characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. <span style="font-style: italic;">Glyphs
</span>can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those
of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. <span style="font-style: italic;">Glyphs
</span>respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who
travel past them ethereally. Multiple <span style="font-style: italic;">glyphs </span>cannot be cast on the same
area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.</p><p>When
casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the
warding sigil. A <span style="font-style: italic;">glyph </span>can be placed to conform to any shape up to the
limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the <span style="font-style: italic;">glyph
