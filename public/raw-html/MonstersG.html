In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack.

The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6.</p><p>A ghost uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p><p aria-label="Size and Type"><strong>Size and Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged.</p><p aria-label="Hit Dice"><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.</p><p aria-label="Speed"><strong>Speed:</strong> Ghosts have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability. </p><p aria-label="Armor Class"><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor is the same as the base creature’s but applies only to ethereal encounters. When the ghost manifests (see below), its natural armor bonus is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.</p><p aria-label="Attack"><strong>Attack:</strong> A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal.</p><p aria-label="Full Attack"><strong>Full Attack:</strong> A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal.</p><p aria-label="Damage"><strong>Damage:</strong> Against ethereal creatures, a ghost uses the base creature’s damage values. Against nonethereal creatures, the ghost usually cannot deal physical damage at all but can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests (see below).</p><p aria-label="Special Attacks"><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect nonethereal creatures. The ghost also gains a manifestation ability plus one to three other special attacks as described below. The save DC against a special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost’s HD + ghost’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.</p><p aria-label="Corrupting Gaze (Su)"><i>Corrupting Gaze (Su):</i> A ghost can blast living beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost’s gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.</p><p aria-label="Corrupting Touch (Su)"><i>Corrupting Touch (Su):</i> A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.</p><p aria-label="Draining Touch (Su)"><i>Draining Touch (Su):</i> A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.</p><p aria-label="Frightful Moan (Su)"><i>Frightful Moan (Su):</i> A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost’s moan for 24 hours.</p><p aria-label="Horrific Appearance (Su)"><i>Horrific Appearance (Su):</i> Any living creature within 60 feet that views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same ghost’s horrific appearance for 24 hours.</p><p aria-label="Malevolence (Su)"><i>Malevolence (Su):</i> Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a <i>magic jar</i> spell (caster level 10th or the ghost’s Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target’s space; moving into the target’s space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost’s Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost’s malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target’s space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target’s body.</p><p aria-label="Manifestation (Su)"><i>Manifestation (Su):</i> Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost’s incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.</p><p>When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghost’s touch spells don’t work on nonethereal targets.</p><p>A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes.</p><p aria-label="Telekinesis (Su)"><i>Telekinesis (Su):</i> A ghost can use <i>telekinesis</i> as a standard action (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost’s HD, whichever is higher). When a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again.</p><p aria-label="Special Qualities"><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A ghost has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below.</p><p aria-label="Rejuvenation (Su)"><i>Rejuvenation (Su):</i> In most cases, it’s difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: The “destroyed” spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost’s HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research.</p><p aria-label="Turn Resistance (Ex)"><i>Turn Resistance (Ex):</i> A ghost has +4 turn resistance.</p><p aria-label="Abilities"><strong>Abilities:</strong> Same as the base creature, except that the ghost has no Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases by +4. </p><p aria-label="Skills"><strong>Skills:</strong> Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.</p><p aria-label="Environment"><strong>Environment:</strong> Any, often as base creature.</p><p aria-label="Organization"><strong>Organization:</strong> Solitary, gang (2–4), or mob (7–12).</p><p aria-label="Challenge Rating"><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Same as the base creature +2.</p><p aria-label="Treasure"><strong>Treasure:</strong> None.</p><p aria-label="Alignment"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p><p aria-label="Level Adjustment"><strong>Level Adjustment:</strong> Same as the base creature +5.</p><section id="h4-19-ghostly-equipment"><h4>Ghostly Equipment</h4><p>When a ghost forms, all its equipment and carried items usually become ethereal along with it. In addition, the ghost retains 2d4 items that it particularly valued in life (provided they are not in another creature’s possession). The equipment works normally on the Ethereal Plane but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures when the ghost manifests, but any such attack has a 50% chance to fail unless the weapon is a ghost touch weapon (just as magic weapons can fail to harm the ghost).</p><p>The original material items remain behind, just as the ghost’s physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the ethereal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place.</p></section></section></section><section id="h2-20-ghoul"><h2>GHOUL</h2><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 59.3251em;" data-no-caption="1"><tbody><tr><td></td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Ghoul</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Ghast</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Medium Undead</td><td>Medium Undead</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Hit Dice:</td><td>2d12 (13 hp)</td><td>4d12+3 (29 hp)</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Initiative:</td><td>+2</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Speed:</td><td>30 ft.

Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces.</p><p>The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The process of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem’s creator.</p><section id="h3-63-combat"><h3>COMBAT</h3><p>Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well. Being mindless, they do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat and cannot be provoked.</p><p>A golem’s creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem’s creator can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone else’s control, and so on), but the golem’s creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to obey him alone.</p><p aria-label="Immunity to Magic (Ex)"><strong>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</strong> Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted.</p></section><section id="h3-64-construction"><h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3><p>The cost to create given for each golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. Creating a golem is essentially similar to creating any sort of magic item. However, a golem’s body includes costly material components that may require some extra preparation. The golem’s creator can assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The builder must have the appropriate skill, which varies with the golem variety.</p><p>Completing the golem’s creation drains the appropriate XP from the creator and requires casting any spells on the final day.</p><p>The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls.</p><p>The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a magic item (caster level, prerequisite feats and spells, market price, cost to create) are given in summary form at the end of each golem’s description.</p><p aria-label="Note"><i>Note:</i> The market price of an advanced golem (a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry) is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die, and increased by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem’s size increases. The XP cost for creating an advanced golem is equal to 1/25 the advanced golem’s market price minus the cost of the special materials required.</p></section><section id="h3-65-clay-golem"><h3>CLAY GOLEM</h3><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 41.0251em;" data-no-caption="1"><tbody><tr><td></td><td style="width: 24.9001em;">Large Construct</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Hit Dice:</td><td style="width: 24.9001em;">11d10+30 (90 hp)</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Initiative:</td><td style="width: 24.9001em;">–1</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Speed:</td><td style="width: 24.9001em;">20 ft.

Beyond that range, they treat all targets as having total concealment. </p><p>Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and scent-based attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as <i>ghost sound</i> or <i>silence</i>) and overpowering odors (such as <i>stinking cloud</i> or incense-heavy air). Negating a grimlock’s sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded. </p><p aria-label="Immunities"><strong>Immunities:</strong> Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.</p><p aria-label="Skills"><strong>Skills:</strong> *A grimlock’s dull gray skin helps it hide in its native terrain, conferring a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in mountains or underground.</p></section><section id="h3-89-grimlocks-as-characters"><h3>GRIMLOCKS AS CHARACTERS</h3><p>Grimlock characters possess the following racial traits.</p><p>— +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, –2 Wisdom, –4 Charisma.</p><p>—Medium size.</p><p>—A grimlock’s base land speed is 30 feet.</p><p aria-label="—Racial Hit Dice">—Racial Hit Dice: A grimlock begins with two levels of monstrous humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +0, Ref +3, and Will +3.</p><p aria-label="—Racial Skills">—Racial Skills: A grimlock’s monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 5 x (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1).
