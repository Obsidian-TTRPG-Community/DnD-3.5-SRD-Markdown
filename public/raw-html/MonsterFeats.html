If the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an awesome blow, its opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking creature’s choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can’t move closer to the attacking creature than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the space adjacent to the obstacle.</p></section><section id="h3-3-craft-construct-item-creation"><h3>CRAFT CONSTRUCT <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3><p aria-label="Prerequisites"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item.</p><p aria-label="Benefit"><strong>Benefit:</strong> A creature with this feat can create any construct whose prerequisites it meets. Enchanting a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To enchant a construct, a spellcaster must spend 1/25 the item’s price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this price (see individual construct monster entries for details).</p><p>A creature with this feat can repair constructs that have taken damage. In one day of work, the creature can repair up to 20 points of damage by expending 50 gp per point of damage repaired.</p><p>A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.</p></section><section id="h3-4-empower-spell-like-ability-general"><h3>EMPOWER SPELL-LIKE ABILITY <small> [GENERAL]</small></h3><p aria-label="Prerequisite"><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.</p><p aria-label="Benefit"><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p><p>When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by one half. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected.</p><p>The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down) –2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat. </p><p aria-label="Special"><strong>Special:</strong> This feat can be taken multiple times.

It can then fly in any direction, including straight down or straight up, at half speed, regardless of its maneuverability.</p><p>If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in place for the turn and take a full-round action. A hovering creature cannot make wing attacks, but it can attack with all other limbs and appendages it could use in a full attack. The creature can instead use a breath weapon or cast a spell instead of making physical attacks, if it could normally do so.</p><p>If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet of the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds so generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature).</p><p>Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD) to cast a spell.</p><p aria-label="Normal"><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, a creature must keep moving while flying unless it has perfect maneuverability.</p></section><section id="h3-7-improved-natural-armor-general"><h3>IMPROVED NATURAL ARMOR <small> [GENERAL]</small></h3><p aria-label="Prerequisites"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Natural armor, Con 13.</p><p aria-label="Benefit"><strong>Benefit:</strong> The creature’s natural armor bonus increases by 1.</p><p aria-label="Special"><strong>Special:</strong> A creature can gain this feat multiple times.

The creature can use that ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p><p>Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another action—including the use of another spell-like ability—in the same round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round.</p><p>The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down) –4.

If the creature gets a hold on a creature three or more sizes smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic bite or claw damage. A snatched opponent held in the creature’s mouth is not allowed a Reflex save against the creature’s breath weapon, if it has one.</p><p>The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a free action or use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 1d6 x 10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet traveled.
