A psionic creature can be born with the subtype or can gain the subtype during its life.</p><p>A creature meeting any one of the following criteria has the psionic subtype:</p><p>• Creatures with a power point reserve, including characters who have levels in a character class that grants them a power point reserve or creatures who have the Wild Talent feat.</p><p>• Creatures with psi-like abilities, including characters who have racial psi-like abilities.</p><p>• Creatures that have spell-like abilities described as “psionics.”</p><p><em>Traits:</em> Other than the fact that all psionic creatures have psionic powers, power points, or psi-like abilities, psionic creatures have no specific traits. The psionic subtype serves to identify creatures that may be vulnerable to powers, spells, and effects targeting psionic creatures.</p></section><section id="h2-2-the-psionic-subtype"><h2>THE PSIONIC SUBTYPE</h2><p>The psionic subtype applies to creatures that can use psionic powers or abilities or that have the ability to manifest powers. (In other words, a creature with the psionic subtype either has a power point reserve or has psi-like abilities.) It also applies to creatures from other sources that have spell-like abilities labeled as “psionics.”</p><p>Characters who have levels in any class that grants the use of psionics, or who have psi-like abilities as racial traits, gain the psionic subtype.</p><p><strong>Traits:</strong> Other than the fact that all psionic creatures have psionic powers or psi-like abilities, psionic creatures have no specific traits. The psionic subtype simply identifies creatures that may be vulnerable to powers, spells, and effects targeting psionic creatures.</p><section id="h4-3-undead-psionic-creatures"><h4>Undead Psionic Creatures</h4><p>A psionic undead creature, although rare, is a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Because undead are immune to mind-affecting effects (including charms and compulsions), they are particularly threatening to other psionic creatures and characters (especially telepaths). Psionic undead creatures can use mind-affecting powers on the living, even though they themselves are immune to such attacks. However, an undead creature may have the psionic subtype if it meets the criteria described above, and thus be vulnerable to non-mindaffecting powers or effects that specifically affect psionic creatures.</p><p>Intelligent constructs and plants with psionic powers or psi-like abilities also share this advantage.</p></section></section><section id="h2-4-psionic-powers"><h2>PSIONIC POWERS</h2><p>Creatures with psionic powers are similar to creatures with racial spellcasting ability. They have the ability to manifest powers just as a member of a psionic character class can (and can activate psionic items accordingly).</p><p>Creatures with the ability to use powers are subject to the same rules for manifesting powers that characters are, but they are not actually members of a class and do not gain any class abilities unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Creatures with psionic powers generally emulate the manifesting ability of a particular psionic class. When such a creature takes levels in that same class, it can stack its innate psionic powers and its class power progression together. </p><p>Creatures with psionic powers that take levels in a class other than the one they emulate combine their two power point reserves into a single reserve, but they manifest powers from each psionic class separately.</p></section><section id="h2-5-psi-like-abilities"><h2>PSI-LIKE ABILITIES</h2><p>Most psionic monsters have some number of psi-like abilities. These are very similar to spell-like abilities. Naturally, they are psionic and work just like powers or spells. A creature with psi-like abilities does not pay for these abilities with power points and does not pay any XP cost associated with manifesting the power the ability duplicates.</p><p>Psi-like abilities do not work in a <i>null psionics field</i> and are subject to power resistance if the power or spell the ability duplicates would be subject to power resistance. A psi-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A psi-like ability that can be used at will has no use limit. Using a psi-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so while threatened provokes attacks of opportunity. It is possible to make a Concentration check to use a psi-like ability defensively and avoid provoking attacks of opportunity, just as when using a power or casting a spell. A psi-like ability can be interrupted just as a spell can be. Psi-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.</p><p>All creatures with psi-like abilities are assigned a manifester level, which indicates how difficult it is to dispel their psi-like effects and determines all level-dependent variables (such as range or duration) the abilities might have. When a creature uses a psi-like ability, the power is manifested as if the creature had spent a number of power points equal to its manifester level, which may augment the power to improve its damage or save DC. However, the creature does not actually spend power points for its psi-like abilities, even if it has a power point reserve due to racial abilities, class levels, or some other psionic ability.</p><p>The DC of a saving throw (if applicable) against a creature’s psi-like ability is 10 + the level of the power or spell the ability duplicates + the creature’s Cha modifier. Remember to check the power’s Augment entry to see if the creature’s manifester level (and thus the effective power point expenditure) increases the DC of the saving throw. Changes to the effect’s save DC, damage, and so on are noted in the psi-like ability entry.</p><section id="h4-6-psionic-focus"><h4>Psionic Focus</h4><p>Some creatures have feats that can be used only when the creature is psionically focused, or that require the creature to expend its psionic focus. Assume that such a creature is psionically focused before entering combat.</p></section><section id="h4-7-psi-like-abilities-and-feats"><h4>Psi-Like Abilities and Feats</h4><p>Creatures with access to psi-like abilities can use the feats Empower Spell-Like Ability and Quicken Spell-Like Ability.</p><p>These feats can be used only on psi-like abilities that do not have increased effects due to augmentation. Furthermore, the creature can empower only a psi-like ability with a level less than or equal to half its manifester level (round down) minus 2, and can quicken only a psi-like ability with a level less than or equal to half its manifester level (round down) minus 4.</p></section><section id="h4-8-creatures-with-psionics-entries"><h4>Creatures with “Psionics” Entries</h4><p>Psionic monsters often possess spell-like abilities that are identified as “psionics,” instead of “spell-like abilities.” For all intents and purposes, creatures with spell-like abilities described as psionics are considered to possess psi-like abilities, and they manifest their powers as described above.</p></section><section id="h4-9-psionic-spells"><h4>Psionic Spells</h4><p>In some cases, a creature’s psi-like abilities (or abilities listed under a creature’s psionics entry) may include an effect that does not duplicate any listed power. For such abilities, simply use the existing spell description. Treat the creature’s</p><p>manifester level as the caster level for the spell. The ability is still psionic in origin, so spells and powers that specifically affect psionic powers can negate or reduce its effects as they would any other psionic power.</p></section><section id="h4-10-psionic-versions-of-creatures"><h4>Psionic Versions Of Creatures</h4><p>Below are presented psionic versions of the following creatures: aboleth, couatl, and duergar,. These alternate versions are psionic equivalents of their standard counterparts.</p><p>Only the portions of the monster entry that are specifically changed by the addition of psionics rules have been listed. All other elements of the creature remain the same.</p></section></section><section id="h2-11-reading-psionic-creature-entries"><h2>READING PSIONIC CREATURE ENTRIES</h2><section id="h4-12-creatures-with-psi-like-abilities"><h4>Creatures with Psi-Like Abilities</h4><p>Each of a creature’s psi-like abilities has a manifester level. Each ability that allows a saving throw also gives a save DC in parentheses following the power name.</p><p>Powers that have increased effects due to augmentation include information about the effect. An asterisk indicates that the power has already been augmented by the creature’s innate ability.</p><p>Powers that can’t be augmented, or that are manifested at their normal minimum level, do not contain any special notations. Resolve the effect of manifesting the power without augmentation at the creature’s given manifester level.</p><p>Some creatures may have particular powers that are manifested at a higher or lower level than their normal manifester level. In such cases, the manifester level is given in the parenthetical information following the power name.</p></section></section></section><section id="h1-13-aboleth-psionic"><h1>ABOLETH, PSIONIC</h1><p>Huge Aberration (Aquatic, Psionic)</p><p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> Psi-like abilities, slime</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Alertness, Combat Manifestation, Iron Will</p><section id="h2-14-combat"><h2>COMBAT</h2><p>A psionic aboleth does not possess spell-like abilities or the enslave ability of the standard aboleth.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p>*Includes augmentation for the aboleth’s manifester level.</p></section></section><section id="h1-15-astral-construct"><h1>ASTRAL CONSTRUCT</h1><p>Astral constructs are brought into being by the metacreativity power <i>astral construct</i>. They are formed from raw ectoplasm (a portion of the astral medium drawn into the Material Plane). The power points spent by the construct’s creator during the manifestation of the power determine the level of the astral construct created. However, even astral constructs of the same level vary somewhat from each other, depending on the whims of their creators.</p><section id="h2-16-combat"><h2>COMBAT</h2><p>Astral constructs act as directed by their creators. As a free action, a construct’s manifester can direct the construct to attack particular enemies, use specific tactics or powers, perform other actions, or do nothing at all. The construct does exactly what its creator directs it to do. </p><p>An astral construct generally appears as an animate clump of ectoplasm with a vaguely humanoid shape, but the manifester can mold or sculpt one according to his or her whim within the limits imposed by the creature’s size. The quality of such “construct sculpture” is determined by a Craft (sculpting) check. A result of 10 to 19 creates a creature that is recognizably similar to the desired creature shape; a result of 20 to 29 creates a construct that looks like an accurate portrayal of that creature type; a result of 30 or higher creates a construct that looks like a specific individual. No matter how high the Craft (sculpting) check result, though, an astral construct’s appearance can’t hide the otherworldly material from which it is formed.</p><p><strong>Construct Traits:</strong> An astral construct has immunity to poison, <i>sleep,</i> paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired.</p><p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Every time an astral construct is created, the manifester can choose to apply one special ability to the construct. When the manifester begins to manifest the <i>astral construct</i> power, he chooses one or more special abilities from a menu of abilities appropriate to that level of astral construct.</p></section><section id="h2-17-creating-an-astral-construct"><h2>CREATING AN ASTRAL CONSTRUCT</h2><p>When manifesting the <i>astral construct</i> power, the manifester assembles the desired creature from a menu of choices, as specified in the construct’s statistics block. A manifester can always substitute two choices from a lesser menu for one of its given abilities. Multiple selections of the same menu choice do not stack unless the ability specifically notes that stacking is allowed.</p><p>Some menu choices grant an astral construct the ability to manifest specific powers as psi-like abilities. Unless using the ability is a free action, an astral construct manifesting such a power does so as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. All such powers have a manifester level equal to the astral construct’s Hit Dice or the creator’s manifester level, whichever is lower.</p><p>An astral construct does not need to meet the prerequisites for a feat granted by a menu choice. </p></section><section id="h2-18-astral-construct-menu-a"><h2>Astral Construct Menu A</h2><p>A manifester creating a 1st-level, 2nd-level, or 3rd-level astral construct can choose one special ability from this menu.</p><p><strong>Buff (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains an extra 5 hit points.</p><p><strong>Celerity (Ex):</strong> The astral construct’s land speed is increased by 10 feet.</p><p><strong>Cleave (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains the Cleave feat. </p><p><strong>Deflection (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Fly (Ex):</strong> The astral construct has physical wings and a fly speed of 20 feet (average).</p><p><strong>Improved Bull Rush (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains the Improved Bull Rush feat.</p><p><strong>Improved Slam Attack (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains the Improved Natural Attack feat.</p><p><strong>Mobility (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains the Mobility feat.</p><p><strong>Power Attack (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains the Power Attack feat.</p><p><strong>Resistance (Ex):</strong> Choose one of the following energy types: fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic. The astral construct gains resistance 5 against that energy type.</p><p><strong>Swim (Ex):</strong> The astral construct is streamlined and shark like, and gains a swim speed of 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Trip (Ex):</strong> If the astral construct hits with a slam attack, it can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking attacks of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the astral construct.</p></section><section id="h2-19-astral-construct-menu-b"><h2>Astral Construct Menu B</h2><p>A manifester creating a 4th-level, 5th-level, or 6th-level astral construct can choose one special ability from this menu. Alternatively, the construct can have two special abilities from Menu A.</p><p><strong>Energy Touch (Ex):</strong> If you are a kineticist, the astral construct’s physical attacks are wreathed in your energy type, dealing an extra 1d6 points of energy damage. If you are not a kineticist, the astral construct deals an extra 1d4 points of damage of an energy type you choose (fire, cold, acid, or electricity) when you manifest the construct.</p><p><strong>Extra Attack:</strong> If the astral construct is Medium or smaller, it gains two slam attacks instead of one when it makes a full attack. Its bonus on damage rolls for each attack is equal to its Strength modifier, not its Strength modifier x 1-1/2. If the astral construct is Large or larger, it gains three slams instead of two when it makes a full attack. Its attacks are otherwise unchanged. </p><p><strong>Fast Healing (Ex):</strong> The astral construct heals 2 hit points each round. It is still immediately destroyed when it reaches 0 hit points.</p><p><strong>Heavy Deflection (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Improved Buff (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains an extra 15 hit points.</p><p><strong>Improved Critical (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains the Improved Critical feat with its slam attacks.</p><p><strong>Improved Damage Reduction (Ex):</strong> The astral construct’s surface forms a hard carapace and provides an additional 3 points of damage reduction (or damage reduction 3/magic if it does not already have damage reduction).</p><p><strong>Improved Fly (Ex):</strong> The astral construct has physical wings and a fly speed of 40 feet (average).</p><p><strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, the construct must hit with its slam attack. A construct can use this ability only on a target that is at least one size smaller than itself. </p><p>Improved Swim: The astral construct is streamlined and sharklike, and gains a swim speed of 60 feet.</p><p><strong>Muscle (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains a +4 bonus to its Strength score.</p><p><strong>Poison Touch (Ex):</strong> If the astral construct hits with a melee attack, the target must make an initial Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 astral construct’s HD + astral construct’s Cha modifier) or take 1 point of Constitution damage. One minute later, the target must save again or take 1d2 points of Constitution damage.</p><p><strong>Pounce (Ex):</strong> If the astral construct charges a foe, it can make a full attack. </p><p><strong>Smite (Su):</strong> Once per day the astral construct can make one attack that deals extra damage equal to its Hit Dice.</p><p><strong>Trample (Ex):</strong> As a standard action during its turn each round, a Large or larger astral construct can literally run over an opponent at least one size smaller than itself. It merely has to move over the opponent to deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + its Str modifier. The target can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 astral construct’s Hit Dice + astral construct’s Str modifier) to negate the damage, or it can instead choose to make an attack of opportunity at a –4 penalty.</p></section><section id="h2-20-astral-construct-menu-c"><h2>Astral Construct Menu C</h2><p>A manifester creating a 7th-level, 8th-level, or 9th-level astral construct can choose one special ability from this menu. Alternatively, the astral construct can have two special abilities from Menu B. (One or both of the Menu B choices can be swapped for two choices from Menu A.)</p><p><strong>Blindsight (Ex):</strong> The astral construct has blindsight out to 60 feet.</p><p><strong>Concussion (Sp):</strong> The astral construct can manifest <i>concussion blast</i> (manifester level 7th) as a free action once per round.</p><p><strong>Constrict (Ex):</strong> The astral construct has the improved grab ability with its slam attack. In addition, on a successful grapple check, the astral construct deals damage equal to its slam damage.</p><p><strong>Dimension Slide (Sp):</strong> The astral construct can manifest <i>dimension slide</i> (manifester level equal to Hit Dice) as a move action once per round.</p><p><strong>Energy Bolt (Sp):</strong> The astral construct can manifest <i>energy bolt</i> (manifester level 8th) as a standard action once per round. The creator sets the energy type that the astral construct can manifest when he creates it. </p><p><strong>Extra Buff (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains an extra 30 hit points.</p><p><strong>Extreme Damage Reduction (Ex):</strong> The astral construct’s surface forms hard, armor-like plates and provides an additional 6 points of damage reduction.</p><p><strong>Extreme Deflection (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains a +8 deflection bonus to Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Natural Invisibility (Su):</strong> The astral construct is constantly invisible, even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell.</p><p><strong>Power Resistance (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains power resistance equal to 10 + its Hit Dice.</p><p><strong>Rend (Ex):</strong> The astral construct makes claw attacks instead of slam attacks (it deals the same amount of damage as it would with its slam damage, but does slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage). An astral construct that hits the same opponent with two claw attacks in the same round rends its foe, which deals extra damage equal to 2d6 + 1-1/2 times its Str modifier.</p><p><strong>Spring Attack (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains the Spring Attack feat.</p><p><strong>Whirlwind Attack (Ex):</strong> The astral construct gains the Whirlwind Attack feat.</p></section></section><section id="h1-21-1st-level-astral-construct"><h1>1ST-LEVEL ASTRAL CONSTRUCT</h1><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Small Construct</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Hit Dice:</td><td>1d10+10 (15 hp)</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Initiative:</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Speed:</td><td>30 ft.

Manifester level 7th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p>*Includes augmentation for the caller’s manifester level.</p><p>**Includes the inherent +4 save adjustment described in the power.</p><p><strong>Steal Essence (Su):</strong> Any living, intelligent creature slain by a caller in darkness’s touch attack is mentally absorbed into the monster’s consciousness. (The physical body of the victim remains intact). Stealing a victim’s essence is a free action; it grants the caller 12 temporary hit points, and a permanent new screaming face appears within its cloud.</p><p>A caller in darkness can also steal the essence of living, intelligent creatures within 30 feet that are paralyzed or sleeping, or that are helpless due to having a mental ability score reduced to 0 (often by the caller’s <i>ego whip</i> attack). Doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The victim dies, and the caller gains 12 temporary hit points.</p><p><strong>Incorporeal Traits:</strong> A caller in darkness is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. The creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn’t wish to be. </p><p><strong>Undead Traits:</strong> A caller in darkness is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, <i>sleep,</i> paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and <i>resurrection</i> works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to 60 feet.</p><p><strong>Unnatural Aura (Su):</strong> Animals can sense the unnatural presence of a caller in darkness. Any animal within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or become panicked until it is no longer within 30 feet of the caller in darkness. A panicked creature that is cornered begins cowering. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><strong>Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex):</strong> Callers in darkness are utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell) and flee from it. A caller caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor can it take full-round actions).</p></section></section><section id="h1-37-cerebrilith"><h1>CEREBRILITH</h1><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Large Outsider (Chaotic, Evil, Extraplanar, Psionic)</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Hit Dice:</td><td>9d8+63 (103 hp)</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Initiative:</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Speed:</td><td>30 ft.
