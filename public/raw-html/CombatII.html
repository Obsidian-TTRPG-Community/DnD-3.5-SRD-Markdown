II (MOVEMENT, MODIFIERS, SPECIAL ACTIONS)</h1><section id="h2-1-movement-position-and-distance"><h2>MOVEMENT,
POSITION, AND DISTANCE</h2><p>Miniatures
are on the 30mm scale—a miniature figure of a six-foot-tall human is
approximately 30mm tall. A square on the battle grid is 1 inch across,
representing a 5-foot-by-5-foot area.</p><section id="h3-2-tactical-movement"><h3>TACTICAL MOVEMENT</h3><section id="h5-3-how-far-can-your-character-move"><h5>How Far Can Your Character Move?</h5><p>Your
speed is determined by your race and your armor (see Table: Tactical Speed).
Your speed while unarmored is your base land speed.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Encumbrance:</span><span> A character encumbered by
carrying a large amount of gear, treasure, or fallen comrades may move slower
than normal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Hampered
Movement:</span><span>
Difficult terrain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper movement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Movement
in Combat:</span><span>
Generally, you can move your speed in a round and still do something (take a
move action and a standard action).</span></p><p>If
you do nothing but move (that is, if you use both of your actions in a round to
move your speed), you can move double your speed.</p><p>If
you spend the entire round running, you can move quadruple your speed. If you do
something that requires a full round you can only take a 5-foot step.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bonuses
to Speed:</span><span>
A barbarian has a +10 foot bonus to his speed (unless he’s wearing heavy
armor). Experienced monks also have higher speed (unless they’re wearing armor
of any sort). In addition, many spells and magic items can affect a character’s
speed. Always apply any modifiers to a character’s speed before adjusting the
character’s speed based on armor or encumbrance, and remember that multiple
bonuses of the same type to a character’s speed don’t stack.</span></p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 40.5751em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table:

the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2 squares, the
third counts as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on.</span></p><p>You
can’t move diagonally past a corner (even by taking a 5-foot step). You can
move diagonally past a creature, even an opponent.</p><p>You
can also move diagonally past other impassable obstacles, such as pits.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Closest
Creature:</span><span>
When it’s important to determine the closest square or creature to a location,
if two squares or creatures are equally close, randomly determine which one
counts as closest by rolling a die.</span></p></section><section id="h5-5-moving-through-a-square"><h5>Moving through a Square</h5><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Friend:</span><span> You can move through a
square occupied by a friendly character, unless you are charging. When you move
through a square occupied by a friendly character, that character doesn’t
provide you with cover.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Opponent:</span><span> You can’t move through a
square occupied by an opponent, unless the opponent is helpless. You can move
through a square occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty. (Some
creatures, particularly very large ones, may present an obstacle even when
helpless. In such cases, each square you move through counts as 2 squares.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ending
Your Movement:</span><span>
You can’t end your movement in the same square as another creature unless it is
helpless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Overrun:</span><span> During your movement you
can attempt to move through a square occupied by an opponent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Tumbling:</span><span> A trained character can
attempt to tumble through a square occupied by an opponent (see the Tumble
skill).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Very
Small Creature:</span><span>
A Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creature can move into or through an occupied
square. The creature provokes attacks of opportunity when doing so.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Square
Occupied by Creature Three Sizes Larger or Smaller:</span><span> Any creature can move through a
square occupied by a creature three size categories larger than it is.</span></p><p>A big creature
can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories smaller
than it is.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Designated
Exceptions:</span><span>
Some creatures break the above rules. A creature that completely fills the
squares it occupies cannot be moved past, even with the Tumble skill or similar
special abilities.</span></p></section><section id="h5-6-terrain-and-obstacles"><h5>Terrain and Obstacles</h5><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Difficult
Terrain: </span><span>Difficult
terrain hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares
of movement. (Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3
squares.) You can’t run or charge across difficult terrain.</span></p><p>If
you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast
as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p><p>Flying
and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Obstacles:</span><span> Like difficult terrain,
obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn’t
completely block it each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts
as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the barrier, in
addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don’t
have sufficient movement to cross the barrier and move into the square on the
other side, you can’t cross the barrier. Some obstacles may also require a
skill check to cross.</span></p><p>On
the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can’t move
through a blocking obstacle.</p><p>Flying
and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Squeezing:</span><span> In some cases, you may
have to squeeze into or through an area that isn’t as wide as the space you
take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide
as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it
were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space you take a –4 penalty on
attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC.</span></p><p>When
a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares) squeezes into a space
that’s one square wide, the creature’s miniature figure occupies two squares,
centered on the line between the two squares. For a bigger creature, center the
creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.</p><p>A
creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it can’t end its
movement in an occupied square.</p><p>To
squeeze through or into a space less than half your space’s width, you must use
the Escape Artist skill. You can’t attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze
through or into a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty to AC, and you lose any
Dexterity bonus to AC.</p></section><section id="h5-7-special-movement-rules"><h5>Special Movement Rules</h5><p>These rules
cover special movement situations.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Accidentally
Ending Movement in an Illegal Space:</span><span> Sometimes a character ends its
movement while moving through a space where it’s not allowed to stop. When that
happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the
closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Double
Movement Cost:</span><span>
When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double.
For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2
squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares (just
as two diagonal moves normally do).</span></p><p>If
movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6
squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then
each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an
exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Minimum
Movement:</span><span>
Despite penalties to movement, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet
(1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. (This rule doesn’t allow you to
move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited.)
Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance
covered, this move isn’t a 5-foot step).</span></p></section></section><section id="h3-8-big-and-little-creatures-in-combat"><h3>BIG AND LITTLE
CREATURES IN COMBAT</h3><p>Creatures
smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to
position. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Tiny,
Diminutive, and Fine Creatures:</span><span> Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of
space. This means that more than one such creature can fit into a single
square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so
four can fit into a single square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine
creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1
square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t
reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack in
melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack
into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally.
Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them.
You can move past them without provoking attacks of opportunity. They also
can’t flank an enemy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Large,
Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures:</span><span> Very large creatures take up more
than 1 square.</span></p><p>Creatures
that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or
more, meaning that they can reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent
squares.</p><p>Unlike
when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural
reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature
with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack of opportunity
against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the
range of its reach before you can attack it. (This attack of opportunity is not
provoked if you take a 5-foot step.)</p><p>Large
or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural
reach but can’t strike at their natural reach or less. </p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 33.1501em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="vertical-align: middle;"><td style="width: 14.775em; border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Table:

determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a
corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the
target’s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or
provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has
cover (+4 to AC).</p><p>When
making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has cover if any
line from your square to the target’s square goes through a wall (including a
low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to
you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from
ranged attacks.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Low
Obstacles and Cover:</span><span> A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your
height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it.
The attacker can ignore the cover if he’s closer to the obstacle than his
target.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cover
and Attacks of Opportunity:</span><span> You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an
opponent with cover relative to you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cover
and Reflex Saves:</span><span> Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks
that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from
you. Note that spread effects can extend around corners and thus negate this
cover bonus.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cover
and Hide Checks:</span><span>
You can use cover to make a Hide check. Without cover, you usually need
concealment (see below) to make a Hide check.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Soft
Cover:</span><span>
Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged
attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no
bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Hide check.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Big
Creatures and Cover:</span><span> Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square)
determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller
creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to
determine if an opponent has cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when
making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares
it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Total
Cover:</span><span> If
you don’t have line of effect to your target he is considered to have total
cover from you. You can’t make an attack against a target that has total cover.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Varying
Degrees of Cover:</span><span> In some
cases, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such
situations the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to
+8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains
improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies.
Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on Hide checks.</span></p></section><section id="h3-12-concealment"><h3>CONCEALMENT</h3><p>To
determine whether your target has concealment from your ranged attack, choose a
corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the
target’s square passes through a square or border that provides concealment,
the target has concealment.</p><p>When
making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has concealment
if his space is entirely within an effect that grants concealment. When making
a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you use the rules for
determining concealment from ranged attacks.</p><p>In
addition, some magical effects provide concealment against all attacks,
regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Concealment
Miss Chance: </span><span>Concealment
gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed
because of the concealment. If the attacker hits, the defender must make a miss
chance percentile roll to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment conditions
do not stack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Concealment
and Hide Checks:</span><span>
You can use concealment to make a Hide check. Without concealment, you usually
need cover to make a Hide check.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Total
Concealment:</span><span>
If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight he is considered
to have total concealment from you. You can’t attack an opponent that has total
concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A
successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has
a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with
concealment).</span></p><p>You can’t
execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with total concealment,
even if you know what square or squares the opponent occupies.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Ignoring
Concealment:</span><span>
Concealment isn’t always effective. A shadowy area or darkness doesn’t provide
any concealment against an opponent with darkvision. Characters with low-light
vision can see clearly for a greater distance with the same light source than
other characters. Although invisibility provides total concealment, sighted
opponents may still make Spot checks to notice the location of an invisible
character. An invisible character gains a +20 bonus on Hide checks if moving,
or a +40 bonus on Hide checks when not moving (even though opponents can’t see
you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual clues).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Varying
Degrees of Concealment:</span><span> Certain situations may provide more or less than typical
concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly.</span></p></section><section id="h3-13-flanking"><h3>FLANKING</h3><p>When
making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is
threatened by a character or creature friendly to you on the opponent’s
opposite border or opposite corner.</p><p>When
in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an opponent in the middle,
trace an imaginary line between the two friendly characters’ centers. If the
line passes through opposite borders of the opponent’s space (including corners
of those borders), then the opponent is flanked.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Exception:
</span><span>If a
flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square
it occupies counts for flanking.</span></p><p>Only
a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a

helpless opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or
otherwise at your mercy.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Regular
Attack:</span><span> A
helpless character takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks, but no
penalty to AC against ranged attacks.</span></p><p>A
helpless defender can’t use any Dexterity bonus to AC. In fact, his Dexterity
score is treated as if it were 0 and his Dexterity modifier to AC as if it were
–5 (and a rogue can sneak attack him).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Coup
de Grace:</span><span>
As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace
to a helpless opponent. You can also use a bow or crossbow, provided you are
adjacent to the target.</span></p><p>You
automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the
damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. A rogue
also gets her extra sneak attack damage against a helpless opponent when
delivering a coup de grace.</p><p>Delivering a
coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents.</p><p>You
can’t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical
hits. You can deliver a coup de grace against a creature with total
concealment, but doing this requires two consecutive full-round actions (one to
“find” the creature once you’ve determined what square it’s in, and one to
deliver the coup de grace).</p></section></section><section id="h2-15-special-attacks"><h2>SPECIAL

melee combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or
interfering with an opponent. If you’re in position to make a melee attack on
an opponent that is engaging a friend in melee combat, you can attempt to aid
your friend as a standard action. You make an attack roll against AC 10. If you
succeed, your friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against
that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent’s next attack (your
choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn.
Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and similar bonuses stack.</p><p>You
can also use this standard action to help a friend in other ways, such as when
he is affected by a spell, or to assist another character’s skill check.</p></section><section id="h3-17-bull-rush"><h3>BULL RUSH</h3><p>You
can make a bull rush as a standard action (an attack) or as part of a charge
(see Charge, below). When you make a bull rush, you attempt to push an opponent
straight back instead of damaging him. You can only bull rush an opponent who
is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Initiating
a Bull Rush: </span><span>First,
you move into the defender’s space. Doing this provokes an attack of
opportunity from each opponent that threatens you, including the defender. (If
you have the Improved Bull Rush feat, you don’t provoke an attack of
opportunity from the defender.) Any attack of opportunity made by anyone other
than the defender against you during a bull rush has a 25% chance of
accidentally targeting the defender instead, and any attack of opportunity by
anyone other than you against the defender likewise has a 25% chance of
accidentally targeting you. (When someone makes an attack of opportunity, make
the attack roll and then roll to see whether the attack went astray.) </span></p><p><span>Second,
you and the defender make opposed Strength checks. </span><span>You each add a +4 bonus for each size category you are
larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for each size category you are smaller than
Medium. You get a +2 bonus if you are charging. The defender gets a +4 bonus if
he has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bull
Rush Results:</span><span>
If you beat the defender’s Strength check result, you push him back 5 feet. If
you wish to move with the defender, you can push him back an additional 5 feet
for each 5 points by which your check result is greater than the defender’s
check result. You can’t, however, exceed your normal movement limit. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>The
defender provokes attacks of opportunity if he is moved. So do you, if you move
with him. The two of you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from each other,
however.)</span></p><p>If you fail to
beat the defender’s Strength check result, you move 5 feet straight back to
where you were before you moved into his space. If that space is occupied, you
fall prone in that space.</p></section><section id="h3-18-charge"><h3>CHARGE</h3><p>Charging
is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to twice your speed
and attack during the action. However, it carries tight restrictions on how you
can move.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Movement
During a Charge:</span><span>
You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet (2
squares) and may move up to double your speed directly toward the designated
opponent.</span></p><p>You must have a
clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as
difficult terrain or obstacles). Here’s what it means to have a clear path.
First, you must move to the closest space from which you can attack the
opponent. (If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can’t charge.)
Second, if any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through
a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an
ally), you can’t charge. (Helpless creatures don’t stop a charge.)</p><p>If
you don’t have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you
can’t charge that opponent.</p><p>You
can’t take a 5-foot step in the same round as a charge.</p><p>If
you are able to take only a standard action or a move action on your turn, you
can still charge, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of
up to double your speed). You can’t use this option unless you are restricted
to taking only a standard action or move action on your turn.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Attacking
on a Charge:</span><span>
After moving, you may make a single melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the
attack roll. and take a –2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next
turn.</span></p><p>A
charging character gets a +2 bonus on the Strength check made to bull rush an
opponent (see Bull Rush, above).</p><p>Even
if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high enough base attack bonus
or from using multiple weapons, you only get to make one attack during a
charge.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Lances
and Charge Attacks:</span><span> A lance deals double damage if employed by a mounted
character in a charge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Weapons
Readied against a Charge: </span><span>Spears, tridents, and certain other piercing weapons deal
double damage when readied (set) and used against a charging character.</span></p></section><section id="h3-19-disarm"><h3>DISARM</h3><p>As
a melee attack, you may attempt to disarm your opponent. If you do so with a
weapon, you knock the opponent’s weapon out of his hands and to the ground. If
you attempt the disarm while unarmed, you end up with the weapon in your hand.</p><p>If you’re
attempting to disarm a melee weapon, follow the steps outlined here. If the
item you are attempting to disarm isn’t a melee weapon the defender may still
oppose you with an attack roll, but takes a penalty and can’t attempt to disarm
you in return if your attempt fails.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
1:</span><span> Attack
of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you are
trying to disarm. (If you have the Improved Disarm feat, you don’t incur an
attack of opportunity for making a disarm attempt.) If the defender’s attack of
opportunity deals any damage, your disarm attempt fails.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
2:</span><span>
Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your
respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a disarm attempt gets
a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a –4 penalty.
(An unarmed strike is considered a light weapon, so you always take a penalty
when trying to disarm an opponent by using an unarmed strike.) If the
combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the
attack roll of +4 per difference in size category. If the targeted item isn’t a
melee weapon, the defender takes a –4 penalty on the roll.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
Three:</span><span>
Consequences. If you beat the defender, the defender is disarmed. If you
attempted the disarm action unarmed, you now have the weapon. If you were
armed, the defender’s weapon is on the ground in the defender’s square.</span></p><p>If
you fail on the disarm attempt, the defender may immediately react and attempt
to disarm you with the same sort of opposed melee attack roll. His attempt does
not provoke an attack of opportunity from you. If he fails his disarm attempt,
you do not subsequently get a free disarm attempt against him.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:
</span><span>A
defender wearing spiked gauntlets can’t be disarmed. A defender using a weapon
attached to a locked gauntlet gets a +10 bonus to resist being disarmed.</span></p><p>Grabbing
Items</p><p>You
can use a disarm action to snatch an item worn by the target. If you want to
have the item in your hand, the disarm must be made as an unarmed attack.</p><p>If
the item is poorly secured or otherwise easy to snatch or cut away the attacker
gets a +4 bonus. Unlike on a normal disarm attempt, failing the attempt doesn’t
allow the defender to attempt to disarm you. This otherwise functions
identically to a disarm attempt, as noted above.</p><p>You
can’t snatch an item that is well secured unless you have pinned the wearer
(see Grapple). Even then, the defender gains a +4 bonus on his roll to resist
the attempt.</p></section><section id="h3-20-feint"><h3>FEINT</h3><p>Feinting
is a standard action. To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by a Sense Motive
check by your target. The target may add his base attack bonus to this Sense
Motive check. If your Bluff check result exceeds your target’s Sense Motive
check result, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow
him to use his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or
before your next turn.</p><p>When
feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid you take a –4 penalty. Against a
creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2), you take a –8 penalty. Against a
nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.</p><p>Feinting in
combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Feinting
as a Move Action:</span><span> With the Improved Feint feat, you can attempt a feint as a
move action instead of as a standard action.</span></p></section><section id="h3-21-grapple"><h3>GRAPPLE</h3><p>Grapple
Checks</p><p>Repeatedly
in a grapple, you need to make opposed grapple checks against an opponent. A
grapple check is like a melee attack roll. Your attack bonus on a grapple check
is: Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + special size modifier</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Special
Size Modifier:</span><span>
The special size modifier for a grapple check is as follows: Colossal +16,
Gargantuan +12, Huge +8, Large +4, Medium +0, Small –4, Tiny –8, Diminutive
–12, Fine –16. Use this number in place of the normal size modifier you use
when making an attack roll.</span></p><p>Starting
a Grapple</p><p>To
start a grapple, you need to grab and hold your target. Starting a grapple
requires a successful melee attack roll. If you get multiple attacks, you can
attempt to start a grapple multiple times (at successively lower base attack
bonuses).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
1:</span><span> Attack
of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you are
trying to grapple. If the attack of opportunity deals damage, the grapple
attempt fails. (Certain monsters do not provoke attacks of opportunity when
they attempt to grapple, nor do characters with the Improved Grapple feat.) If
the attack of opportunity misses or fails to deal damage, proceed to Step 2.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
2:</span><span> Grab.
You make a melee touch attack to grab the target. If you fail to hit the
target, the grapple attempt fails. If you succeed, proceed to Step 3.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
3:</span><span> Hold.
Make an opposed grapple check as a free action.</span></p><p>If
you succeed, you and your target are now grappling, and you deal damage to the
target as if with an unarmed strike.</p><p>If
you lose, you fail to start the grapple. You automatically lose an attempt to
hold if the target is two or more size categories larger than you are.</p><p>In
case of a tie, the combatant with the higher grapple check modifier wins. If
this is a tie, roll again to break the tie.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
4:</span><span>
Maintain Grapple. To maintain the grapple for later rounds, you must move into
the target’s space. (This movement is free and doesn’t count as part of your
movement in the round.)</span></p><p>Moving,
as normal, provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents, but not from
your target.</p><p>If
you can’t move into your target’s space, you can’t maintain the grapple and
must immediately let go of the target. To grapple again, you must begin at Step
1.</p><p>Grappling
Consequences</p><p>While
you’re grappling, your ability to attack others and defend yourself is limited.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">No
Threatened Squares:</span><span> You don’t threaten any squares while grappling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">No
Dexterity Bonus:</span><span>
You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if you have one) against opponents you
aren’t grappling. (You can still use it against opponents you are grappling.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">No
Movement:</span><span>
You can’t move normally while grappling. You may, however, make an opposed
grapple check (see below) to move while grappling.</span></p><p>If
You’re Grappling</p><p>When
you are grappling (regardless of who started the grapple), you can perform any
of the following actions. Some of these actions take the place of an attack
(rather than being a standard action or a move action). If your base attack
bonus allows you multiple attacks, you can attempt one of these actions in
place of each of your attacks, but at successively lower base attack bonuses.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Activate
a Magic Item:</span><span>
You can activate a magic item, as long as the item doesn’t require a spell
completion trigger. You don’t need to make a grapple check to activate the
item.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Attack
Your Opponent:</span><span>
You can make an attack with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or light weapon
against another character you are grappling. You take a –4 penalty on such
attacks.</span></p><p>You
can’t attack with two weapons while grappling, even if both are light weapons.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Cast
a Spell:</span><span>
You can attempt to cast a spell while grappling or even while pinned (see
below), provided its casting time is no more than 1 standard action, it has no
somatic component, and you have in hand any material components or focuses you
might need. Any spell that requires precise and careful actionis
impossible to cast while grappling or being pinned. If the spell is one that
you can cast while grappling, you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 +
spell level) or lose the spell. You don’t have to make a successful grapple
check to cast the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Damage
Your Opponent:</span><span>
While grappling, you can deal damage to your opponent equivalent to an unarmed
strike. Make an opposed grapple check in place of an attack. If you win, you
deal nonlethal damage as normal for your unarmed strike (1d3 points for Medium
attackers or 1d2 points for Small attackers, plus Strength modifiers). If you
want to deal lethal damage, you take a –4 penalty on your grapple check.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Exception:
</span><span>Monks
deal more damage on an unarmed strike than other characters, and the damage is
lethal. However, they can choose to deal their damage as nonlethal damage when
grappling without taking the usual –4 penalty for changing lethal damage to
nonlethal damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Draw
a Light Weapon:</span><span>
You can draw a light weapon as a move action with a successful grapple check.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Escape
from Grapple:</span><span>
You can escape a grapple by winning an opposed grapple check in place of making
an attack. You can make an Escape Artist check in place of your grapple check
if you so desire, but this requires a standard action. If more than one
opponent is grappling you, your grapple check result has to beat all their
individual check results to escape. (Opponents don’t have to try to hold you if
they don’t want to.) If you escape, you finish the action by moving into any
space adjacent to your opponent(s).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Move:</span><span> You can move half your
speed (bringing all others engaged in the grapple with you) by winning an
opposed grapple check. This requires a standard action, and you must beat all
the other individual check results to move the grapple.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:
</span><span>You get a
+4 bonus on your grapple check to move a pinned opponent, but only if no one
else is involved in the grapple.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Retrieve
a Spell Component: </span><span>You can produce a spell component from your pouch while
grappling by using a full-round action. Doing so does not require a successful
grapple check.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Pin
Your Opponent:</span><span>
You can hold your opponent immobile for 1 round by winning an opposed grapple
check (made in place of an attack). Once you have an opponent pinned, you have
a few options available to you (see below).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Break
Another’s Pin: </span><span>If
you are grappling an opponent who has another character pinned, you can make an
opposed grapple check in place of an attack. If you win, you break the hold
that the opponent has over the other character. The character is still
grappling, but is no longer pinned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Use
Opponent’s Weapon: </span><span>If your opponent is holding a light weapon, you can use it to
attack him. Make an opposed grapple check (in place of an attack). If you win,
make an attack roll with the weapon with a –4 penalty (doing this doesn’t
require another action).</span></p><p>You
don’t gain possession of the weapon by performing this action.</p><p>If
You’re Pinning an Opponent</p><p>You
can attempt to damage your opponent with an opposed grapple check, you can
attempt to use your opponent’s weapon against him, or you can attempt to move
the grapple (all described above). At your option, you can prevent a pinned
opponent from speaking.</p><p>You
can use a disarm action to remove or grab away a well secured object worn by a
pinned opponent, but he gets a +4 bonus on his roll to resist your attempt (see
Disarm).</p><p>You
may voluntarily release a pinned character as a free action; if you do so, you
are no longer considered to be grappling that character (and vice versa).</p><p>You
can’t draw or use a weapon (against the pinned character or any other
character), escape another’s grapple, retrieve a spell component, pin another
character, or break another’s pin while you are pinning an opponent.</p><p>If
You’re Pinned by an Opponent</p><p>When
an opponent has pinned you, you are held immobile (but not helpless) for 1
round. While you’re pinned, you take a –4 penalty to your AC against opponents
other than the one pinning you. At your opponent’s option, you may also be
unable to speak. On your turn, you can try to escape the pin by making an
opposed grapple check in place of an attack. You can make an Escape Artist
check in place of your grapple check if you want, but this requires a standard
action. If you win, you escape the pin, but you’re still grappling.</p><p>Joining
a Grapple</p><p>If
your target is already grappling someone else, you can use an attack to start a
grapple, as above, except that the target doesn’t get an attack of opportunity
against you, and your grab automatically succeeds. You still have to make a
successful opposed grapple check to become part of the grapple.</p><p>If
there are multiple opponents involved in the grapple, you pick one to make the
opposed grapple check against.</p><p>Multiple
Grapplers</p><p>Several
combatants can be in a single grapple. Up to four combatants can grapple a
single opponent in a given round. Creatures that are one or more size
categories smaller than you count for half, creatures that are one size
category larger than you count double, and creatures two or more size
categories larger count quadruple.</p><p>When
you are grappling with multiple opponents, you choose one opponent to make an
opposed check against. The exception is an attempt to escape from the grapple;
to successfully escape, your grapple check must beat the check results of each
opponent.</p></section><section id="h3-22-mounted-combat"><h3>MOUNTED COMBAT</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Horses
in Combat: </span><span>Warhorses
and warponies can serve readily as combat steeds. Light horses, ponies, and
heavy horses, however, are frightened by combat. If you don’t dismount, you
must make a DC 20 Ride check each round as a move action to control such a
horse. If you succeed, you can perform a standard action after the move action.
If you fail, the move action becomes a full round action and you can’t do
anything else until your next turn.</span></p><p>Your
mount acts on your initiative count as you direct it. You move at its speed,
but the mount uses its action to move.</p><p>A
horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2
squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share your mount’s space
during combat.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Combat
while Mounted:</span><span>
With a DC 5 Ride check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to use
both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.</span></p><p>When you attack
a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the +1 bonus on
melee attacks for being on higher ground. If your mount moves more than 5 feet,
you can only make a single melee attack. Essentially, you have to wait until
the mount gets to your enemy before attacking, so you can’t make a full attack.
Even at your mount’s full speed, you don’t take any penalty on melee attacks
while mounted.</p><p>If
your mount charges, you also take the AC penalty associated with a charge. If
you make an attack at the end of the charge, you receive the bonus gained from
the charge. When charging on horseback, you deal double damage with a lance (see
Charge).</p><p>You can use
ranged weapons while your mount is taking a double move, but at a –4 penalty on
the attack roll. You can use ranged weapons while your mount is running
(quadruple speed), at a –8 penalty. In either case, you make the attack roll when
your mount has completed half its movement. You can make a full attack with a
ranged weapon while your mount is moving. Likewise, you can take move actions
normally</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Casting
Spells while Mounted:</span><span> You can cast a spell normally if your mount moves up to a
normal move (its speed) either before or after you cast. If you have your mount
move both before and after you cast a spell, then you’re casting the spell
while the mount is moving, and you have to make a Concentration check due to
the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount is
running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to
twice its speed, but your Concentration check is more difficult due to the
violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">If
Your Mount Falls in Battle:</span><span> If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 Ride
check to make a soft fall and take no damage. If the check fails, you take 1d6
points of damage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">If
You Are Dropped:</span><span>
If you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (or
75% if you’re in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of
damage.</span></p><p>Without
you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.</p></section><section id="h3-23-overrun"><h3>OVERRUN</h3><p>You
can attempt an overrun as a standard action taken during your move. (In
general, you cannot take a standard action during a move; this is an
exception.) With an overrun, you attempt to plow past or over your opponent
(and move through his square) as you move. You can only overrun an opponent who
is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller. You can make
only one overrun attempt per round.</p><p>If you’re
attempting to overrun an opponent, follow these steps.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
1:</span><span> Attack
of Opportunity. Since you begin the overrun by moving into the defender’s
space, you provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
2: </span><span>Opponent
Avoids? The defender has the option to simply avoid you. If he avoids you, he
doesn’t suffer any ill effect and you may keep moving (You can always move
through a square occupied by someone who lets you by.) The overrun attempt
doesn’t count against your actions this round (except for any movement required
to enter the opponent’s square). If your opponent doesn’t avoid you, move to
Step 3.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
3:</span><span>
Opponent Blocks? If your opponent blocks you, make a Strength check opposed by
the defender’s Dexterity or Strength check (whichever ability score has the
higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus on the check for every size
category he is larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for every size category he is
smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has more
than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win,
you knock the defender prone. If you lose, the defender may immediately react
and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check
(including the size modifiers noted above, but no other modifiers) to try to
knock you prone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
4: </span><span>Consequences.
If you succeed in knocking your opponent prone, you can continue your movement
as normal. If you fail and are knocked prone in turn, you have to move 5 feet
back the way you came and fall prone, ending your movement there. If you fail
but are not knocked prone, you have to move 5 feet back the way you came,
ending your movement there. If that square is occupied, you fall prone in that
square.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Improved
Overrun:</span><span>
If you have the Improved Overrun feat, your target may not choose to avoid you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Mounted
Overrun (Trample):</span><span> If you attempt an overrun while mounted, your mount makes
the Strength check to determine the success or failure of the overrun attack
(and applies its size modifier, rather than yours). If you have the Trample
feat and attempt an overrun while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid
you, and if you knock your opponent prone with the overrun, your mount may make
one hoof attack against your opponent.</span></p></section><section id="h3-24-sunder"><h3>SUNDER</h3><p>You
can use a melee attack with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon to strike a weapon

1:</span><span> Attack
of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target whose
weapon or shield you are trying to sunder. (If you have the Improved Sunder
feat, you don’t incur an attack of opportunity for making the attempt.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
2: </span><span>Opposed
Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective
weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a sunder attempt gets a +4 bonus
on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a –4 penalty. If the
combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the
attack roll of +4 per difference in size category.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Step
3:</span><span>
Consequences. If you beat the defender, roll damage and deal it to the weapon
or shield. See Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points
to determine how much damage you must deal to destroy the weapon or shield.</span></p><p>If
you fail the sunder attempt, you don’t deal any damage.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sundering
a Carried or Worn Object: </span><span>You don’t use an opposed attack roll to damage a carried or
worn object. Instead, just make an attack roll against the object’s AC. A
carried or worn object’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier + the Dexterity
modifier of the carrying or wearing character. Attacking a carried or worn
object provokes an attack of opportunity just as attacking a held object does.
To attempt to snatch away an item worn by a defender rather than damage it, see
Disarm. You can’t sunder armor worn by another character.</span></p></section><section id="h3-25-throw-splash-weapon"><h3>THROW SPLASH
WEAPON</h3><p>A
splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering
its contents over its target and nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a
splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown weapons
require no weapon proficiency, so you don’t take the –4 nonproficiency penalty.
A hit deals direct hit damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures
within 5 feet of the target.</p><p>You
can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack
against AC 5. However, if you target a grid intersection, creatures in all
adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not
dealt to any creature. (You can’t target a grid intersection occupied by a
creature, such as a Large or larger creature; in this case, you’re aiming at
the creature.)</p><p>If
you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll
1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being straight back
at you and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the grid intersection or
target creature. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction
equal to the range increment of the throw.</p><p>After
you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures
in adjacent squares.</p></section><section id="h3-26-trip"><h3>TRIP</h3><p>You

opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Making
a Trip Attack:</span><span>
Make an unarmed melee touch attack against your target. This provokes an attack
of opportunity from your target as normal for unarmed attacks.</span></p><p>If your attack
succeeds, make a Strength check opposed by the defender’s Dexterity or Strength
check (whichever ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4
bonus for every size category he is larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for
every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on
his check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a
normal humanoid. If you win, you trip the defender. If you lose, the defender
may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or
Strength check to try to trip you.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Avoiding
Attacks of Opportunity: </span><span>If you have the Improved Trip feat, or if you are tripping
with a weapon (see below), you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity for
making a trip attack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Being
Tripped (Prone):</span><span>
A tripped character is prone. Standing up is a move action.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Tripping
a Mounted Opponent:</span><span> You may make a trip attack against a mounted opponent. The
defender may make a Ride check in place of his Dexterity or Strength check. If
you succeed, you pull the rider from his mount.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Tripping
with a Weapon:</span><span>
Some weapons can be used to make trip attacks. In this case, you make a melee
touch attack with the weapon instead of an unarmed melee touch attack, and you
don’t provoke an attack of opportunity.</span></p><p>If
you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid

clerics and some neutral clerics can channel negative energy, which can halt,
awe (rebuke), control (command), or bolster undead.</p><p>Regardless
of the effect, the general term for the activity is “turning.” When attempting
to exercise their divine control over these creatures, characters make turning
checks.</p><p>Turning
Checks</p><p>Turning
undead is a supernatural ability that a character can perform as a standard
action. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>You
must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Times
per Day: </span><span>You
may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma
modifier. You can increase this number by taking the Extra Turning feat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Range:</span><span> You turn the closest
turnable undead first, and you can’t turn undead that are more than 60 feet
away or that have total cover relative to you. You don’t need line of sight to
a target, but you do need line of effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Turning
Check:</span><span>
The first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead
creature you can turn. This is a Charisma check (1d20 + your Charisma
modifier). Table: Turning Undead gives you the Hit Dice of the most powerful
undead you can affect, relative to your level. On a given turning attempt, you
can turn no undead creature whose Hit Dice exceed the result on this table.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Turning
Damage:</span><span>
If your roll on Table: Turning Undead is high enough to let you turn at least
some of the undead within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + your cleric level + your Charisma
modifier for turning damage. That’s how many total Hit Dice of undead you can
turn.</span></p><p>If
your Charisma score is average or low, it’s possible to roll fewer Hit Dice of
undead turned than indicated on Table: Turning Undead.</p><p>You
may skip over already turned undead that are still within range, so that you do
not waste your turning capacity on them.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Effect
and Duration of Turning:</span><span> Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means
available to them. They flee for 10 rounds (1 minute). If they cannot flee,
they cower (giving any attack rolls against them a +2 bonus). If you approach
within 10 feet of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally.
(You can stand within 10 feet without breaking the turning effect—you just
can’t approach them.) You can attack them with ranged attacks (from at least 10
feet away), and others can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the
turning effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Destroying
Undead:</span><span>

Clerics and Undead</p><p>Evil
clerics channel negative energy to rebuke (awe) or command (control) undead
rather than channeling positive energy to turn or destroy them. An evil cleric
makes the equivalent of a turning check. Undead that would be turned are
rebuked instead, and those that would be destroyed are commanded.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Rebuked:</span><span> A rebuked undead creature
cowers as if in awe (attack rolls against the creature get a +2 bonus). The
effect lasts 10 rounds.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Commanded:</span><span> A commanded undead
creature is under the mental control of the evil cleric. The cleric must take a
standard action to give mental orders to a commanded undead. At any one time,
the cleric may command any number of undead whose total Hit Dice do not exceed
his level. He may voluntarily relinquish command on any commanded undead
creature or creatures in order to command new ones.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Dispelling
Turning:</span><span>
An evil cleric may channel negative energy to dispel a good cleric’s turning
effect. The evil cleric makes a turning check as if attempting to rebuke the
undead. If the turning check result is equal to or greater than the turning
check result that the good cleric scored when turning the undead, then the
undead are no longer turned. The evil cleric rolls turning damage of 2d6 +
cleric level + Charisma modifier to see how many Hit Dice worth of undead he
can affect in this way (as if he were rebuking them).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Bolstering
Undead:</span><span>
An evil cleric may also bolster undead creatures against turning in advance. He
makes a turning check as if attempting to rebuke the undead, but the Hit Dice
result on Table: Turning Undead becomes the undead creatures’ effective Hit
Dice as far as turning is concerned (provided the result is higher than the
creatures’ actual Hit Dice). The bolstering lasts 10 rounds. An evil undead
cleric can bolster himself in this manner.</span></p><p>Neutral
Clerics and Undead</p><p>A
cleric of neutral alignment can either turn undead but not rebuke them, or
rebuke undead but not turn them. See Turn or Rebuke Undead for more
information.</p><p>Even
if a cleric is neutral, channeling positive energy is a good act and channeling
negative energy is evil.</p><p>Paladins
and Undead</p><p>Beginning
at 4th level, paladins can turn undead as if they were clerics of three levels
lower than they actually are.</p><p>Turning
Other Creatures</p><p>Some
clerics have the ability to turn creatures other than undead.</p><p>The
turning check result is determined as normal.</p></section><section id="h3-28-two-weapon-fighting"><h3>TWO-WEAPON
FIGHTING</h3><p>If
you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per
round with that weapon. You suffer a –6 penalty with your regular attack or
attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to the attack with your off
hand when you fight this way. You can reduce these penalties in two ways:</p><p>•If
your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed
strike is always considered light.)</p><p>•The

INITIATIVE ACTIONS</h2><p>Here
are ways to change when you act during combat by altering your place in the
initiative order.</p><section id="h3-30-delay"><h3>DELAY</h3><p>By
choosing to delay, you take no action and then act normally on whatever
initiative count you decide to act. When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your
own initiative result for the rest of the combat. When your new, lower
initiative count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally. You
can specify this new initiative result or just wait until some time later in
the round and act then, thus fixing your new initiative count at that point.</p><p>You
never get back the time you spend waiting to see what’s going to happen. You
can’t, however, interrupt anyone else’s action (as you can with a readied
action).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Initiative
Consequences of Delaying: </span><span>Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took
the delayed action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed
an action, you don’t get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again).</span></p><p>If
you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up,
your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you
do not get your regular action that round.</p></section><section id="h3-31-ready"><h3>READY</h3><p>The
ready action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your turn is over
but before your next one has begun. Readying is a standard action. It does not
provoke an attack of opportunity (though the action that you ready might do
so).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Readying
an Action:</span><span>
You can ready a standard action, a move action, or a free action. To do so,
specify the action you will take and the conditions under which you will take
it. Then, any time before your next action, you may take the readied action in
response to that condition. The action occurs just before the action that
triggers it. If the triggered action is part of another character’s activities,
you interrupt the other character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he
continues his actions once you complete your readied action. Your initiative
result changes. For the rest of the encounter, your initiative result is the
count on which you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead of
the character whose action triggered your readied action.</span></p><p>You
can take a 5-foot step as part of your readied action, but only if you don’t
otherwise move any distance during the round. </p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Initiative
Consequences of Readying:</span><span> Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took
the readied action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed
your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied action (though you can
ready the same action again). If you take your readied action in the next
round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that
new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that
round.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Distracting
Spellcasters:</span><span>
You can ready an attack against a spellcaster with the trigger “if she starts
casting a spell.” If you damage the spellcaster, she may lose the spell she was
trying to cast (as determined by her Concentration check result).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Readying
to Counterspell:</span><span>
You may ready a counterspell against a spellcaster (often with the trigger “if
she starts casting a spell”). In this case, when the spellcaster starts a
spell, you get a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell
level). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (are able to cast it and
have it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as a
counterspell and automatically ruin the other spellcaster’s spell.
Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.</span></p><p>A
spellcaster can use <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic </span>to counterspell another spellcaster,
but it doesn’t always work.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Readying
a Weapon against a Charge:</span><span> You can ready certain piercing weapons, setting them to
receive charges. A readied weapon of this type deals double damage if you score
a hit with it against a charging character.</span></p></section></section></section></body></html>
