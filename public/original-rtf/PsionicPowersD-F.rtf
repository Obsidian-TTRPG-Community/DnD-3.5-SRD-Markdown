\par You choose to use }{\i dispel psionics }{in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel.
\par }{\i Targeted Dispel: }{One object, creature, or power is the target of the }{\i dispel psionics }{
power. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +10) against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the power\rquote 
s manifester level. If you succeed on a particular check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect.
\par If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power or is under 
the effect of an ongoing power, you make a dispel check to end the power or its effect. If the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item\rquote s manifester level. If you succeed, all the item\rquote 
s psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface  is temporarily closed. A psionic item\rquote 
s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by
\par mortal power such as this.
\par You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifested yourself.
\par }{\i Area Dispel: }{When }{\i dispel psionics }{i
s used in this way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more powers, you make a dispel check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that check fails, you ma
ke dispel checks against progressively weaker powers until you dispel one power (which discharges the }{\i dispel psionics }{power so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature\rquote s psionic items are not affected.

\par For each object within the area that is the target of one or more powers, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.
\par For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the }{\i dispel psionics }{power, you can make a dispel check to dispel the power.
\par For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the }{\i dispel psionics }{power, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
\par If an object or creature that is the eff
ect of an ongoing power is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the power that created that object or construct in addition to attempting to dispel powers targeting the creature or object. You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel check
s against any power that you have manifested.
\par }{\b Augment:}{ For every additional power point you spend, the bonus on your dispel check increases by 2 (to a maximum bonus of +20 for a 5-point expenditure).

\par Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Your body\rquote 
s psionically fueled bioenergetic currents produce an arc of energy of the chosen type that targets a creature you designate as the primary foe for 9d6 points of damage in every round when the power remains in effect. Energy also arcs off
 the primary foe to strike one additional foe that is initially within 15 feet of the primary foe, or that subsequently moves within 15 feet of the primary foe while the duration lasts. Secondary foes take half the damage that the primary foe takes in eve
ry round while the duration lasts.
\par Should either the primary or secondary foe fall to less than 0 hit points (or should a target completely evade the effect with a special ability or power), the }{\i energy current }{\rquote s arc randomly retargets another primary and/o

\par This power causes instant growth, doubling your height, length, and width and multiplying your weight by 8. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Strength, a \endash 
2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum effective Dexterity score of 1), a \endash 1 size penalty on attack rolls, and a \endash 1 size penalty to Armor Class due to your increased size.
\par If your new size is Large or larger, you have a space of at least 10 feet and a natural reach of at least 10 feet. This power doesn\rquote t change your speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the ma

you cannot crush yourself to death by increasing your size.
\par All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly expanded by this power. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage.
\par Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves your possession (including a
 projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). Multiple effects that increase size do not stack, which 
means (among other things) that you can\rquote t use a second manifestation of this power to further expand yourself.
\par }{\b Augment:}{ You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.

sionic or magical equipment (it does possess a duplicate of all your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well as mundane versions of any psionic or magical equipment you have). You and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your
 
remaining usages of pertinent special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with two negative levels for the purpose of determining the powers 
t
o which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative levels cannot be removed by any means). Your duplicate has all other physical traits you had at the time you manifest this power. Powers, spells, or other effects aff
ecting you when you manifest this power do not transfer to your duplicate. 
\par When the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from each other you are. You gain back any power points the duplicate has n
ot spent. At the time of rejoining, you take half of the damage your duplicate has taken since this power was manifested. This damage could potentially leave you with negative hit points, but it can\rquote t reduce your hit points to less than \endash 9.

\par If your duplica
te dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain one negative level. If you die, your duplicate remains in existence, and is for all intents you, but with two negative levels. (Once the duration expires, one of the negative levels im
mediately converts to one lost level; the other negative level can be removed by standard means.)

t only once). For each of the six ability scores, the fused being\rquote s score is the higher of yours and the other creature\rquote s, and the fused being also has the higher Hit Dice or manifester level\emdash 
this effectively means the fused being uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and skill modifiers of either member, and it manifests powers at the higher of the manifester levels that you or the other creature possessed before becoming fused.
\par You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being and what equipment remains available for use. These fused items are restored once the power ends.
\par When the power ends, the fused being separates. The other creature appears in an area adjacent to you that you determine. If separation occurs in a cramped space, the oth
er creature is expelled through the Astral Plane, finally coming to rest materially in the nearest empty space and taking 1d6 points of damage for each 10 feet of solid material passed through.
\par Damage taken by the fused being is split evenly between you and the other creature when the power ends. You do not leave the }{\i fusion }{with more hit points than you entered it with, unless you were damaged prior to the }{\i fusion }{
and the fused being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the fused being\rquote s remaining power points are split between you and the other creature (you can leave with more points than you entered with, as long as you don\rquote 
t exceed the maximum power points for your level and ability score). Ability damage and negative levels are also split between y
ou and the other creature. (If an odd number of negative levels or ability score reductions must be split, you decide whether you or the other creature receives the additional loss.)
\par If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent creatures, both ofwhich are also dead. You cannot use }{\i fission }{on a fused being.
