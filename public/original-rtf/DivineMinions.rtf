\par All types of beings may serve deities. In general, a deity only accepts minions who have accomplished some great deed in service to the deity. Such minions usually have the same alignment as the deity. No minion\rquote 
s alignment is opposed to the patron deity\rquote s alignment on either the law\endash chaos axis or the good\endash evil axis.

s presence is too high, the deity may use proxies.
\par Proxies are divine minions invested with a small portion of the deity\rquote s po
wer. A deity may invest 1 rank of its power (reducing its divine rank accordingly) in a single servant for as long as the deity chooses. The minion must be physically present for the deity to perform the investiture. While so invested, the proxy gains any
 
salient divine abilities held by the patron deity as well as the powers and abilities of a rank 1 demigod. Without the requisite ability scores or divine ranks, the proxy may not be able to use all those powers and abilities. A deity may have more than on
e proxy, but it must lose 1 divine rank for each proxy it invests. A deity can retrieve a single divine rank as a standard action, and doing so it does not require the physical presence of the proxy.

s home plane. Those that survive the journey across the planes become servants of their deity. While a few may remain disembodied spirits, most become petitioners through the divine will of their patron deity. 
\par In general, petitioners appear in the form that they had when they died, though they may be remade by deities to fit the nature of their particular afterlife. In general, petitioners who become divine servants are creatu
res that originally had at least 1 Intelligence and 1 Wisdom.
\par The following creature types may become petitioners depending on the deity: aberrations, animals, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, and plants, oozes, and ver
min with sufficient ability scores. Constructs and undead are not usually made into petitioners, though the spirits of their original forms may be. Elementals and outsiders tend to meld with their native planes, and as such do not become petitioners. Thei
r spirits may still be called back from the dead, however.
\par The template presented below is for NPCs, not player characters. If dead characters who are petitioners are later restored to life (once again becoming player characters), they forget any of their experiences as petitioners.

 is a template that may be added to any creature as determined by the nature of the campaign (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature\rquote s type changes to outsider, and the creature uses all the base creature\rquote 
s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
\par }{\b\fs20 Hit Dice: }{\fs20 Change to 2d8. Retain bonus hit points.
\par }{\b\fs20 AC:}{\fs20  Natural Armor Class, Dexterity, and size bonuses or penalties apply. Armor bonuses are not applicable.
\par }{\b\fs20 Attacks:}{\fs20  Base attack bonus is reduced to +2, subject to modifications for size and Strength.
\par }{\b\fs20 Special Attacks:}{\fs20  A petitioner loses all supernatural and spell-like attacks, but retains normal and exceptional attacks.
\par }{\b\fs20 Special Qualities:}{\fs20  A petitioner loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities, but retains exceptional abilities. In addition, it gains the following qualities.
\par }{\i\fs20 Mental Immunity: }{\fs20 All petitioners are immune to mind-affecting effects. 
\par }{\i\fs20 Other Immunities: }{\fs20 Depending on its nature, the petitioner is immune to two 
of the following effects: acid, cold, electricity, fire, poison, petrifaction, or polymorphing. These immunities are applied similarly to all petitioners of a particular plane or deity.
\par }{\i\fs20 Resistance}{\fs20 s: Depending on the nature of the petitioner\rquote s plane, the petitioner gains resistance 20 against two of the following effects: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.
\par }{\i\fs20 Planar Commitment: }{\fs20 Petitioners cannot leave the plane they inhabit. They are teleported one hundred miles in a random direction if an attempt is made to force them to leave.
\par }{\i\fs20 Additional Special Qualities: }{\fs20 Particular planes may provide additional benefits for petitioners of those planes. Typical additional special qualities may include any one of the following.
\par \bullet  Damage reduction 5/silver and spell resistance 5.

\par \bullet  Fast healing 1.
\par \bullet  Damage reduction 10/magic.

\par }{\b\fs20 Saves:}{\fs20  Base saving throw bonuses are +3.
\par }{\b\fs20 Abilities:}{\fs20  Same as the base creature. Some cosmologies or deities may set a maximum of 18 for petitioner ability scores. Abilities higher than that are reduced to the maximum.
