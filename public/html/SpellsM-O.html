conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It
then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound
immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches
within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured
may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the
barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to
figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.</p><p>If
an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and
delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage)
once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible
creature.</p><p>The
dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the
intruder’s turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose
of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.</p><p>The
spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it
lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant
from the hound, the spell ends.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Material

conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane
from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in
the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter
the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you
enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have
passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous
chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.</p><p>You
can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell’s effect. The
place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course
banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent
servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon
all who enter. The servants function as <span style="font-style: italic;">unseen servant </span>spells except
that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.</p><p>Since
the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do
not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Focus:

tiny silver spoon (each item worth 5 gp).</span></p></section><section id="h3-7-mage-s-private-sanctum"><h3>Mage’s Private

Yes</span></p><p>This
spell brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword
strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round
that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each
round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Int
bonus or your Cha bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an
additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and
incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat
range of 19–20 and a critical multiplier of x2.</p><p>The
sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking
or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you,
if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns
to you and hovers.</p><p>Each
round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a
new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round’s
target.</p><p>The
sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">disintegrate</span>, a <span style="font-style: italic;">sphere of annihilation</span>, or a <span style="font-style: italic;">rod of
cancellation </span>affects it. The sword’s AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium
object, +3 deflection bonus).</p><p>If
an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first
time <span style="font-style: italic;">Mage’s sword </span>strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the
spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that
creature for the duration of the spell.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Focus:

Resistance:</span><span>
No; see text</span></p><p>All
creatures within the area gain the effects of a <span style="font-style: italic;">protection from evil </span>spell,
and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome
a creature’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third
function of <span style="font-style: italic;">protection from evil</span>), but the deflection and resistance
bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’
spell resistance.</p><p>This
spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <span style="font-style: italic;">magic
circle against evil </span>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused
inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <span style="font-style: italic;">lesser
planar binding, planar binding, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">greater planar binding </span>spells)
for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell
that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic circle</span>. The
creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit
into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <span style="font-style: italic;">protection
from evil </span>spell for that creature only.</p><p>A
<span style="font-style: italic;">magic circle </span>leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of
powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect
immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle,
directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has
spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its
spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature
capable of any form of dimensional travel (<span style="font-style: italic;">astral projection, blink,
dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </span>and
similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can
prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a <span style="font-style: italic;">dimensional
anchor </span>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts.
If you are successful, the <span style="font-style: italic;">anchor </span>effect lasts as long as the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic
circle </span>does. The creature cannot reach across the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic circle, </span>but
its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like)
can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks
except for the circle itself.</p><p>You
can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along
its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic
circle </span>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and
requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If
the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the
diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This
task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3
hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p><p>A
successful diagram allows you to cast a <span style="font-style: italic;">dimensional anchor </span>spell on the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic
circle </span>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <span style="font-style: italic;">anchor </span>holds
any called creatures in the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic circle </span>for 24 hours per caster level.
A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <span style="font-style: italic;">magic circle </span>prepared
with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If
the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <span style="font-style: italic;">lesser
planar binding </span>spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately
released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. However,
the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly,
as noted above.</p><p>This

Yes</span></p><p>By
casting <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar, </span>you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known
as the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar</span>), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to
take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar. </span>You
may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and
attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to
your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.</p><p>To
cast the spell, the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar </span>must be within spell range and you must
know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it.
When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can
tell, dead. </p><p>While
in the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar, </span>you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet
per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of
effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature
types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense
a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can
determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.
(Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead
creatures have, or are, souls.)</p><p>You
could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which
particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined
randomly.</p><p>Attempting
to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <span style="font-style: italic;">protection from
evil </span>or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature’s soul
into the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar </span>unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure
to take over the host leaves your life force in the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar, </span>and the
target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to
possess its body again.</p><p>If
you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life
force is imprisoned in the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar. </span>You keep your Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses,
alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body
with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous
two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body’s
extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like
abilities do not stay with the body.</p><p>As
a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar </span>if
within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when
you shift from the jar to your own body.</p><p>If
the host body is slain, you return to the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar, </span>if within range,
and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain
beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with
nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p><p>If
the spell ends while you are in the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar, </span>you return to your body
(or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you
are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your
current position), and the soul in the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar </span>returns to its body (or
dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the
spell can be dispelled at either the <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar </span>or at the host’s
location.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Focus:

spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that
suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs.
The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any
language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The
mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical
effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were
placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak.
Of course, <span style="font-style: italic;">magic mouth </span>can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other
object or creature.</p><p>The
spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your
command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as
desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react
to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal
darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical <span style="font-style: italic;">darkness </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">invisibility
</span>does. Silent movement or magical <span style="font-style: italic;">silence </span>defeats audible triggers.
Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise
or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A
<span style="font-style: italic;">magic mouth </span>cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class
except by external garb.</p><p>The
range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can
command a <span style="font-style: italic;">magic mouth </span>to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.
Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers
and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Magic
