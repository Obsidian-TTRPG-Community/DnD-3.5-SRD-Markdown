subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is
similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is
45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker’s normal speed.</p><p>A
strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of
its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per
hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in
exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement
or physical damage from being buffeted about.</p><p>Should
the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails
slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it
reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls
the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall.
Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this
way if the <span style="font-style: italic;">air walk </span>spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic

assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. The new
form must be within one size category of your normal size. The maximum HD of an
assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level.
You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.</p><p>You
retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment,
base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all
supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form,
except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as
a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).</p><p>You
keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels,
but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels.</p><p>If
the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any
spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be
able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components
and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material
components.</p><p>You
acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.
Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as
burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum
speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor
bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses,
racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of
wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not
allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than
normal.</p><p>You
do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted
above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision,
blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.</p><p>You
do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like
abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the
same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with
a template, even if that template doesn’t change the creature type or subtype.</p><p>You
can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair
color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of
that kind. The new form’s significant physical qualities (such as height,
weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the
norms for the new form’s kind. You are effectively disguised as an average
member of the new form’s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you
get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.</p><p>When
the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the
new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the
new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any
objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on
your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items
you wore in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal form fall off and
land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body
part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same
way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the
whole reverts to its true form.</p></section><section id="h3-9-analyze-dweomer"><h3>Analyze Dweomer</h3><p>Divination</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level:</span><span> Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 6</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Components:</span><span> V, S, F</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Casting

freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project
an astral body onto another plane altogether.</p><p>You

these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting.

stranded wherever you left them.</p><p>You
project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body
behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell
projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.
Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to
any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral
Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence
you have chosen to enter.</p><p>While
you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your
physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed,
astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord.
When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord
remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral
form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the
Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their
actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body
must be materialized on other planes.</p><p>You

creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting
right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly
or under some form of compulsion, <span style="font-style: italic;">atonement </span>operates normally at no cost
to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and
acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity
(requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject’s burden. Many
casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see <span style="font-style: italic;">geas/quest</span>) or
similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before
casting the <span style="font-style: italic;">atonement </span>spell on its behalf.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Atonement
</span><span>may be
cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Reverse
Magical Alignment Change: </span><span>If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, <span style="font-style: italic;">atonement
</span>returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience
points.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Restore
Class: </span><span>A
paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have
her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Restore
Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: </span><span>A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast
spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by
seeking <span style="font-style: italic;">atonement </span>from another cleric of the same deity or another
druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP
for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose
XP.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Redemption
or Temptation: </span><span>You
may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer
it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject
must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell,
the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or
acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion,
or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity
offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell
does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment
naturally.</span></p><p>Though
the spell description refers to evil acts, <span style="font-style: italic;">atonement </span>can also be used on
any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts
are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:
</span><span>Normally,
changing alignment is up to the player. This use of <span style="font-style: italic;">atonement </span>simply
offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment
drastically, suddenly, and definitively.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Material

Yes</span></p><p>A
<span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target
gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your
caster level.</p><p>You
may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant
who casts <span style="font-style: italic;">suggestion</span>, your caster level for this casting of <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>increases
by 1. For each assistant who casts <span style="font-style: italic;">dominate animal, dominate person, </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">dominate
monster, </span>your caster level for this casting of <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>increases by
a number equal to one-third of that assistant’s level, provided that the
spell’s target is appropriate for a <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>spell. Since the assistants’
spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <span style="font-style: italic;">binding
</span>spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants’ spells
are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial
Will saving throw and how long the <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>lasts. All <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>spells
are dismissible.</p><p>Regardless
of the version of <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>you cast, you can specify triggering
conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur.
These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition
must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can
be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be
based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit
Dice, or hit points don’t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering
conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC
(assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.</p><p>If
you are casting any of the first three versions of <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>(those with
limited durations), you may cast additional <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>spells to prolong
the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving
throw at the end of the first spell’s duration, even if your caster level was
high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on
this save, all the <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>spells it has received are broken.</p><p>The
<span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions
when you cast the spell.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Chaining:
</span><span>The
subject is confined by restraints that generate an <span style="font-style: italic;">antipathy </span>spell
affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is
one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>is
confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Slumber:
</span><span>This
version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per
caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <span style="font-style: italic;">slumbering</span>,
nor does it age. This form of <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>is more difficult to cast than <span style="font-style: italic;">chaining</span>,
making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Bound
Slumber: </span><span>This
combination of <span style="font-style: italic;">chaining </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">slumber </span>lasts for as long as one
month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hedged
Prison: </span><span>The
subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from
which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save
DC by 3.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Metamorphosis:
</span><span>The
subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless
in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The
creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the
container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>is
permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <span style="font-style: italic;">metamorphosed</span>,
nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Minimus
Containment: </span><span>The
subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem,
jar, or similar object. The <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>is permanent. The subject does not
need to breathe, eat, or drink while <span style="font-style: italic;">contained</span>, nor does it age. Reduce
the save DC by 4.</span></p><p>You
can’t dispel a <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>spell with <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic </span>or a similar
effect, though an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">Mage’s disjunction </span>affects
it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane
due to <span style="font-style: italic;">dismissal, banishment, </span>or a similar effect.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Components:
</span><span>The
components for a <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>spell vary according to the version of the
spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the
scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials
appropriate to the form of <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>used. These components can include
such items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest
sort (for <span style="font-style: italic;">slumber </span>bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the
like.</span></p><p>In
addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of <span style="font-style: italic;">binding </span>(cost
500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the
target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be
captured.</p></section><section id="h3-39-black-tentacles"><h3>Black Tentacles</h3><p>Conjuration

treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the
damage reduction of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures
(though the spell doesn’t grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also
becomes good, which means it can bypass the damage reduction of certain
creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon
might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected
projectile weapons (such as bows) don’t confer the benefit to the projectiles
they shoot.</p><p>In

successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last effect does not apply

several effects, as follows.</span></p><p>Physical
attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn’t
help opponents, since you’re ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack
is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for
concealment).</p><p>If
the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%.
(For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no
miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you
sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.</p><p>Any
individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you’re <span style="font-style: italic;">blinking
</span>unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own
spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case
they typically do not affect the Material Plane.</p><p>While
<span style="font-style: italic;">blinking</span>, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage
from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible
creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity
bonus to AC.</p><p>You
take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.</p><p>While
<span style="font-style: italic;">blinking</span>, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For
each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you
become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space
and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only
three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed,
and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)</p><p>Since
you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even
attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the
same way you interact with material ones.</p><p>An
ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any
direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through
solid objects, including living creatures.</p><p>An
ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks
gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to
60 feet.</p><p>Force
effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the
Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal
creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal
affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have
attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal
creatures and objects as material.</p></section><section id="h3-48-blur"><h3>Blur</h3><p>Illusion
