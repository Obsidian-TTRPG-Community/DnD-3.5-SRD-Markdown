automatically adapts to hostile environments. You can adapt to underwater,
extremely hot, extremely cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive
as if you were a creature native to that environment. You can breathe and move
(though penalties to movement and attacks, if any for a particular environment,
remain), and you take no damage simply from being in that environment. You need
not specify what environment you are adapting to when you manifest this power;
simply activate it, and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile
environment as needed throughout the duration.</p><p>You can
somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid, lava, fire, and
electricity. Any environmental feature that normally directly deals 1 or more
dice of damage per round deals you only half the usual amount of damage.</p></section><section id="h3-2-affinity-field"><h3>Affinity Field</h3><p>Psychometabolism</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level:</span><span> Psion/wilder 9</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Display:</span><span> Material and visual</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifesting Time:</span><span> 1 standard action</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Range:</span><span> 20 ft.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Area:</span><span> 20-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Duration:</span><span> 1 round/level (D)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Saving

manifested upon them normally. All magical and psionic effects transferred to
subjects fade at the end of this power’s duration, although instantaneous
effects remain. If you suddenly become immune to a particular effect or power,
the effect or power to which you are immune cannot be transferred to creatures
that have affinity to you.</p></section><section id="h3-3-anchored-navigation"><h3>Anchored Navigation</h3><p>Clairsentience</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level:</span><span> Seer 4</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Display:</span><span> Material and olfactory</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manifesting

ability bonus. Because you are emulating the idealized form of an animal, you
also take on minor aspects of the animal you choose. If you choose to increase
the ability you use to manifest powers, you do not gain the benefit of an

caravan into the Astral Plane, leaving the Material Plane behind. Since the
Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these
other planes as you wish, but only if you know your way (see below).</p><p>You can bring
other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects have each
manifested <span style="font-style: italic;">astral traveler </span>and are linked hand to hand with you at the
time of the <span style="font-style: italic;">astral caravan</span>’s manifestation. These fellow travelers are
dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to
you during the journey that causes you to break hand-to-hand contact, your
companions are stranded wherever you leave them. Because the planes are a
dangerous place, those who lead <span style="font-style: italic;">astral caravans </span>usually choose to
manifest this power only if they have a large party of travelers assembled.
Sometimes groups of lower-level adventurers may hire you to lead forays beyond
the Material Plane.</p><p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">astral
caravan </span>power lasts while you and your fellow travelers maintain your
original formation, until (1) you reach your intended destination plane, (2)
you desire to end the power while still traversing the Astral Plane, (3) you or
anyone traveling with you breaks the hand-to-hand chain connecting the
travelers for 2 consecutive rounds, or (4) the power is terminated by some
outside means, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span>. When the power ends, you and
your fellow travelers halt in whatever portion of the Astral Plane you happen
to be traversing (the Astral Plane is in many ways subjective in location; in
any event, one place on the Astral looks much like any other).</p><p>While you are
traveling through the Astral Plane, those natives who happen to glimpse you and
your fellow travelers perceive you to be moving at a speed of 30 feet (you
can’t run), with you flying in the lead and your fellow travelers strung out
behind you, each linked to the next by one hand.</p><p>Depending on
your knowledge of the planes, your journey through the subjective space that is
the Astral Plane may take a longer or shorter period of time. For each 24 hours
you travel, make a Knowledge (the planes) check. Unless a location is
particularly hard to find and well guarded, or conversely easy to find and well
advertised, the average DC for an <span style="font-style: italic;">astral caravan </span>journey should be set
at 20. You cannot take 20 on this check, though you can take 10. Each check may
be modified by your degree of familiarity with the destination or by some
connection you have with the place; see the tables below.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 36.3751em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="2" style="width: 30.1501em; border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Destination

in the caravan (being linked by hand is not required if this membrane is used).
You remain visible within the translucent, amorphous enclosure. You can pick up
or drop willing passengers, easily reaching through the film. Anything you hold
is enveloped by the film. Any attacks made through the enclosure in either
direction have a 25% miss chance due to the rippling membrane.</span></p><p>When you

weaves strands of astral ectoplasm into a crystal containing the seed of your
living mind (hardness 1 and 1 hit point). You can have only one <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed </span>in
existence at any one time. Until such time as you perish, the <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed </span>(also
called the storage crystal) is utterly inert. If you are slain at some later
date, your soul transfers into the storage crystal, which begins to dimly glow.</p><p>Upon
transference, your physical remains (should they still exist) become inert
matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life. The transfer from the slain
body to the <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed </span>works over any distance, physical or
extradimensional.</p><p>Once your
body’s physical demise activates the storage crystal, you have the abilities of
a psicrystal of the appropriate level, plus all the powers you knew and the
maximum power points you possessed when <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed </span>was manifested—but
you also have a negative level that cannot be healed and that does not convert
to real level loss in your current crystalline form. You have thirty days to
grow an organic body, after which time your sentience fades and your soul
passes on if it hasn’t entered a new body.</p><p>To grow a body,
you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in uninterrupted solitude. The
body’s constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, then
slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing body that is an exact
duplicate of your body at the time you manifested <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed </span>(the
crystal itself breaks down and becomes a part of the new organic body). When
the tenth day ends, you completely and totally inhabit the new body. You
possess all the abilities you possessed when <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed </span>was manifested,
at one level lower, but you have none of your equipment.</p><p>If the body is
struck for any amount of damage during the ten-day period when it is growing,
it is destroyed and your soul passes on.</p><p>Conceivably,
you could manifest <span style="font-style: italic;">mind switch </span>to utilize a temporary body, but only an
evil creature would smash his own temporarily empty storage crystal to
permanently usurp a subject’s organic body (unless the subject is itself

through use of the <span style="font-style: italic;">astral caravan </span>power. While participating in a
journey allowed by the <span style="font-style: italic;">astral caravan </span>power, you must hold the hand of
both your fellow passenger ahead of you (or the caravan leader) and your fellow
passenger behind you (unless you happen to be the last in the hand-linked
line). If you or any one of your fellow passengers breaks the hand-to-hand link
for 2 consecutive rounds, the impetus through the Astral Plane provided by <span style="font-style: italic;">astral
caravan </span>fails. See the <span style="font-style: italic;">astral caravan </span>power for more information.</p><p>All those who
are part of the caravan who are capable of performing purely mental actions,
such as manifesting a power, may do so while maintaining hand-to-hand contact
with their fellow travelers. When astral travelers begin their journey, each
one is connected to the Material Plane by an insubstantial silvery cord. Very
few weapons exist that can damage a silvery cord.</p><p>The last
creature in the line of those making up the caravan is sometimes referred to as
the rear guard, because he or she has one hand free and can use it to wield a
weapon without relinquishing his or her grip on the next traveler in line. The
weightless, subjective environment of the Astral Plane allows the caravan to
flex and bend as necessary to bring the rear guard’s weapon to bear.</p></section><section id="h3-11-attraction"><h3>Attraction</h3><p>Telepathy

compelling attraction in the mind of the subject. The attraction can be toward
a particular person or an object. The subject will take reasonable steps to
meet, get close to, attend, or find the object of its implanted attraction. For
the purpose of this power, “reasonable” means that, while attracted, the
subject doesn’t suffer from blind obsession. He will act on this attraction
only when not engaged in combat. The subject won’t perform obviously suicidal
actions. He can still recognize danger but will not flee unless the threat is
immediate. If you make the subject feel an attraction to yourself, you can’t
command him indiscriminately, although he will be willing to listen to you
(even if he disagrees). This power grants you a +4 bonus on any interaction
checks you make involving the subject (such as Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate,
and Sense Motive).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Augment:</span><span> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC

pyrokinetically control the intensity or movements of one fire source. A
nonmagical fire source can be controlled if it is equal to or smaller than the
maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester level, as
noted on the accompanying table. You can freely switch control between fire
sources, or change the nature of your control, while you maintain
concentration, but only one specified change (keeping a fire burning, animating
it, or altering its size) can be made to one fire source in a round. When your
control over a fire source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its
original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been moved away from its
original location). With this power, you can artificially keep a fire burning
that would normally expire for lack of fuel; even dousing a controlled flame
with water does not put it out (though completely submerging the flame would).
Normally, a creature at risk of catching on fire can avoid this fate by making
a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, with success indicating that the fire has gone
out. If the fire is one that has been kept burning by the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">control
flames, </span>then the DC of the Reflex save needed to put out the flames
increases to 25.</p><p>This power also
enables you to make a fire move as if it were a living creature. You can
animate only a naturally burning fire; if you attempt to animate one that has
been increased or decreased in size by your augmentation of this power, the
fire immediately returns to its original size. An animated fire moves at a
speed of 30 feet. A fire that moves away from its fuel or its original location
dies as soon as your control over it lapses. </p><p>An animated
fire can enter any square, even if a creature already occupies it. If an
animated fire enters a square occupied by a creature, that creature can make a
Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the number of dice of damage the
fire does + your Int modifier if you are a psion or your Cha modifier if you
are a wilder). A successful Reflex save moves the creature to the nearest
unoccupied square. The flames deal the indicated damage to any creature that is
either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire’s space); see the
accompanying table).</p><p>At the start of
your turn, the animated fire deals damage to any creature in its space, and the
creature catches on fire unless it makes a Reflex save (DC as noted above). A
victim on fire takes 1d6 points of damage each round. Additional rounds in the
same space as the animated fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition.
The damage from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving
throw each round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the
animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify f lames that are already
burning (thus denying the foe Ref lex saves after the first).</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 48.9751em;"><tbody style="vertical-align: middle;"><tr style="break-inside: avoid; vertical-align: middle;"><td colspan="5" style="border-top: none; border-right: none; border-left: none; border-image: initial; border-bottom: 1pt solid windowtext; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: top;">Control
