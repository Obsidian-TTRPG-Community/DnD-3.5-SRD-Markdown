# EPIC MAGIC ITEMS 2

## Scrolls

To generate an epic scroll randomly, first roll on Table: Scroll Types
to determine whether the spells are arcane or divine. An epic scroll
contains 1d8 spells. For each spell, roll on Table: Epic Scroll Spell
Levels to determine its level and then on the appropriate section of
Table: Actual Spell Levels to determine the spell's actual level and
total metamagic level adjustments. To determine the specific metamagic
level adjustments, roll on the appropriate section of Table: Metamagic
Level Adjustment to Spells. To determine the spell, use the appropriate
sections of the nonepic scroll tables.

## Staffs

Staffs have 50 charges when created, and they can't be recharged.

Staffs use the wielder's ability score and relevant feats to set the DC
for saves against their spells in such cases where those values would be
higher than the listed values for the staffs.

Standard epic staffs are described below.

**Cosmos:** This staff allows use of the following spells.

-   Chain lightning (intensified, 1 charge, DC 29)
-   Meteor swarm (intensified, 1 charge, DC 34)
-   Sunburst (intensified, 1 charge, DC 32)

Intensify Spell, *chain lightning, meteor swarm, sunburst; Market

**Domination:** This staff allows use of the following heightened
spells.

-   Dominate monster (1 charge, DC 33)

-   Mass charm monster (1 charge, DC 32)
-   Geas (heightened, 1 charge, DC 33)

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Staff, Craft Epic Staff,
Heighten Spell, *demand, dominate monster, geas, mass charm monster;
Market Price:* 464,400 gp.

**Fiery Power:** This +*5 flaming quarterstaff* grants its wielder fire
resistance 30 whenever held. In addition, it has the following powers.

    charges, DC 22)

-   *Summon monster IX* (extended, 2 charges, elder fire elemental only)
    A *staff of fiery power* can be broken in a retributive strike. The
    breaking of the staff must be purposeful and declared by the
    wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released
    in a 30-foot- radius globe. All within 10 feet of the broken staff
    take points of damage equal to eight times the number of charges in
    the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take six times the
    number of charges in damage, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant
    take four times the number of charges in damage. Successful Reflex
    saving throws (DC 17) reduce the damage sustained by half. The
    character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to
    another plane of existence; if he or she does not, the explosive
    release of spell energy destroys him or her. After all charges are
    used up from the staff, it remains a +*5 quarterstaff* with no
    special abilities. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be broken in a
    retributive strike.)

**Gate Key:** When properly operated, the gate key can be used to attune
any bounded space, such as a doorway or a cave opening, to another
bounded space on another plane of existence previously visited by the

springs up at each location, and the two portals are connected. When the
wielder creates a pair of portals, he or she also establishes the
necessary key that travelers must have to access the portal. Possible
keys include nothing, a pearl, a particular hair color, or even the
*gate key* itself. Up to sixty different pairs of portals can be attuned
in this manner. Once all sixty pairs of portals are created, the key
cannot create additional gates, though it may still be the necessary key
to access some or all of the portals. To any creature without the proper
key, the interdimensional portals are not visible (through *true seeing*

**Horseshoes of the Peerless Steed:** These horseshoes magically adhere
to the feet of any hoofed creature. Anyone riding the creature gains a

riding an unfamiliar mount). The horseshoes grant the creature (or its
rider, as appropriate) the effects of the Trample, Ride-By Attack, and

## Intelligent Items

Just like nonepic magic items, epic magic items sometimes possess
intelligence of their own. Such items are fully sentient and should be
treated as NPCs. The Random Epic Magic Items section details the chances
that epic armor, shields, rings, rods, staffs, wondrous items, and
weapons might be intelligent. In short, a ring, rod, staff, wondrous
item, armor, or shield has a 1% chance to be intelligent, a ranged
weapon has a 5% chance to be intelligent, and a melee weapon has a 15%
chance to be intelligent. Rather than using the tables for nonepic
items, use the tables below to determine the properties of an
intelligent item: the number of powers, unusual properties, alignment,
and special purpose of the item (if any). Of the three mental ability
scores, two scores are favored (2d6 + some number) and one is completely
random (3d6). Choose which scores get assigned which number, or roll 1d4
and determine randomly according to the following table.

  ----- -------------- -------------- -----------
  1d4   High Score     Medium Score   Low Score
  1     Intelligence   Charisma       Wisdom
  2     Intelligence   Wisdom         Charisma
  3     Wisdom         Intelligence   Charisma
  4     Charisma       Intelligence   Wisdom
  ----- -------------- -------------- -----------

  : Table: Mental Ability Scores for Intelligent Items

The first step in determining the properties of a random intelligent
epic magic item is to determine its general capabilities. These are
found by rolling d% and consulting Table: Epic Items Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities.

### Market Price Modifier

To find the market price for an epic magic item, use these expanded
guidelines, adjusting as necessary to find an appropriate final price.
Each point of Intelligence bonus, Wisdom bonus, or Charisma bonus
increases the item's market price by 400 gp. Any form of communication
possessed by the item increases its market price by the number shown on
Table: Epic Item Communication. Each primary ability possessed by the
item increases its market price by 2,000 to 10,000 gp (average 6,000
gp). Each extraordinary ability possessed by the item increases its
market price by 15,000 to 35,000 gp (average 25,000 gp). A special
purpose increases the item's market price by 50,000 gp. An awesome power
increases the item's market price by 100,000 gp.

### Intelligent Item Alignment

Any item with Intelligence has an alignment. Make sure that the
alignment choosen or determine randomly (using Table: Item Alignment)
matches any alignment-oriented special abilities of the item. Any
character whose alignment is not compatible with that of the item gains
one negative level for every 10 points of the weapon's Ego (see Item
Ego, below) if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this
never results in actual level loss, the negative levels remain as long
as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including
*restoration* spells). These negative levels are cumulative with any
other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders.

  : Table: Intelligent Item Primary Abilities

If the same ability is rolled twice or more, the range, frequency, or
effectiveness of the power is doubled, tripled, and so on. All abilities
function only when the item is held, drawn, or otherwise brandished and
the possessor is concentrating on the desired result. Activating a power
is a standard action, but using a free feat is not. Feats may be used
regardless of prerequisites, but the item still must be held and drawn
(or worn, in the case of such items). An intelligent item might activate
a power on its own.

  : Table: Intelligent Item Extraordinary Powers

If the same power is rolled twice, the uses per day are doubled. (If
*true seeing* or *passwall* is rolled twice, roll again.) Powers
function only when the item is drawn and held, and the possessor is
concentrating upon the desired effect. Activating a power is a standard
action. An intelligent item might activate a power on its own.

  : Table: Intelligent Item Awesome Powers

Unless otherwise stated, all awesome powers function at 20th caster
level. If a power is rolled twice, the uses per day are doubled. Powers
function only when the item is drawn and held, and the possessor is
concentrating upon the desired effect. Activating a power is a standard
action. An intelligent item might activate a power on its own.

### Special Purpose Items

#### Purpose

An item's purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and
should always be treated reasonably.

  : Table: Intelligent Item Purpose

### Special Purpose Power

A special purpose power operates only when the item is in pursuit of its
special purpose. This is always up to the purview of the item. It should
always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends justify the
means. That is to say that if the player's reasoning for how a
particular action serves the item's purpose is not completely
believable, the item won't allow it.

### Item Ego

Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an
item possesses. Only after all aspects of an item have been generated
and recorded can its Ego score be determined. Ego is a factor with
regard to the dominance of item over character, as detailed below.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------
  Attribute of Item                                                Ego Points
  Each +1 enhancement of item up to +5                             1
  Each +1 enhancement of item above +5                             2
  Each +1 bonus of special abilities                               1
  Each primary ability^1^                                          1
  Each extraordinary power^1^                                      2
  Each awesome power^1^                                            6
  Special purpose                                                  4
  Telepathic ability                                               1
  Read languages ability                                           1
  *Read magic* ability                                             1
  Each +1 of Intelligence bonus                                    1
  Each +1 of Wisdom bonus                                          1
  Each +1 of Charisma bonus                                        1
  1 If uses per day are doubled, Ego points are doubled as well.   
  ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------

  : Table: Item Ego

### Items Against Characters

When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item
is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who
possesses the item is not true to that alignment's goals or the item's
special purpose, personality conflict---item against
character---results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or
higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a
personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with
the item. When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a
Will saving throw (DC = item's Ego). If the possessor succeeds, he or
she is dominant. If he or she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance
lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major
battle, a serious threat to either item or character, and so on). Should
an item gain dominance, it resists the character's desires and demands
concessions such as any of the following:

-   Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is
    distasteful to the item.
-   The character divesting him or herself of all other magic items or
    items of a certain type.
-   Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go
    for its own purposes.
-   Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.
-   Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation
    when it is not in use.
-   That the character carry the item with him or her on all occasions.
-   That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable
    possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.

In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures.

-   Force its possessor into combat.
-   Refuse to strike opponents.
-   Strike at its wielder or his or her associates.
-   Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.
-   Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp.

Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the
character's and item's alignments or when their purposes and
personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a
lesser character possess it in order to easily command him or her, or a
higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals. All magic
items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever
activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of
each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item
wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of
the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and most
intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so
that he or she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might
change this sort of behavior.

Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the
characters who possess them, even though they may never successfully
control their possessor. They may be powerless to force their demands
but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.

## Artifacts

### Minor Artifacts

Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items, but rather magic items
that no longer can be made by common mortal means---even by the hands of
epic creators. Such items have no established market price. Below is a
selection of known minor artifacts.

**Everfull Purse:** This leather belt pouch has the power to turn a
single gold coin into many overnight. If a single gold piece is placed
in the *everfull purse* at sunset, it will be replaced at sunrise by 25
gold pieces. The *purse* has no effect if more than one gold piece is
left within, or if anything other than gold is placed within.

*Caster Level:* 20th; *Weight:* 1/2 lb.

**Libram of Gainful Conjuration:** This mystic book is of great value to
arcane spellcasters of good alignment (LG, NG, CG). Study of the work
requires one week. Upon completion, the good arcane caster gains a +1
inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane
spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or
her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels
in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of
the classes to be affected.) Nongood arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LE,
NE, or CE) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and
must atone (see the *atonement* spell) in order to gain any further
experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a
single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity
(see the *insanity* spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a
*libram of gainful conjuration* can't be distinguished from any other
book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book
vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever
benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.

*Caster Level:* 19th; *Weight:* 3 lb.

**Libram of Ineffable Damnation:** This mystic book is of great value to
arcane spellcasters of evil alignment (LE, NE, CE). Study of the work
requires one week. Upon completion, the evil arcane caster gains a +1
inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane
spell-casting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or
her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels
in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of
the classes to be affected.) Nonevil arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LG,
NG, or CG) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and
must atone (see the *atonement* spell) in order to gain any further
experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a
single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity
(see the *insanity* spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a
*libram of ineffable damnation* can't be distinguished from any other
book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book
vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever
benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.

*Caster Level:* 19th; *Weight:* 3 lb.

**Libram of Silver Magic:** This mystic book is of great value to arcane
spellcasters of neutral alignment (LN, N, CN). Study of the work
requires one week. Upon completion, the neutral arcane caster gains a +1
inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane
spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or
her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels
in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of
the classes to be affected.) Evil or good arcane spellcasters (LE, NE,
CE, LG, NG, or CG) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of
Constitution and must atone (see the *atonement* spell) in order to gain
any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who
reads even a single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or
suffer insanity (see the *insanity* spell). Except as indicated above,
the writing in a *libram of silver magic* can't be distinguished from
any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the
book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever
benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.

*Caster Level:* 19th; *Weight:* 3 lb.

**Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms:** This treatise contains expert
advice and instruction in the arts of combat. Any barbarian, fighter,
monk, paladin, or ranger who spends one week studying the manual gains a
+1 inherent bonus to Strength and experience points sufficient to place
him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has
levels in more than one of the classes listed, he or she must choose one
of the classes to be affected.) A character without any levels in one of
the classes listed gains no bonus from the work, but if an arcane
spellcaster without levels in one of the classes listed scans even a
single word he or she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make a Will save
(DC 20) or have 1 point of Intelligence permanently drained. Except as
indicated above, the writing in a *manual of puissant skill at arms*
can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until
perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can
the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second
time.

*Caster Level:* 19th; *Weight:* 3 lb.

**Manual of Stealthy Pilfering:** This guide to thievery grants any
rogue who spends a week studying its lessons a +1 inherent bonus to
Dexterity and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway
into the next level of experience. A character without any rogue levels
gains no bonus from the work, but if a divine spellcaster without rogue
levels scans even a single word she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make
a Will save (DC 20) or have 1 point of Wisdom permanently drained.
Except as indicated above, the writing in a *manual of stealthy
pilfering* can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or
so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen
again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar
tome a second time.

*Caster Level:* 19th; *Weight:* 3 lb.

**Rogue's Dice:** This pair of cubes appears much like any other pair of
typical (6-sided) dice. A character with a pair of *rogue's dice* who
wishes to roll them must announce that he or she is rolling the dice
(accidental rolls have no effect). Rolling the dice is a standard
action, and both dice must be rolled simultaneously to have any effect.
The player should roll 2d6 and consult the table below to determine the
*dice's* affects.

  ----- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  2d6   Effect
  2     Lose 10,000 XP and dice roll again next round
  3     Permanently lose 1d4+1 Dex
  4     Gain 1d4 negative levels (Fortitude DC 20 to remove)
  5     --1 penalty on all attacks, saves, and checks for 1 hour
  6     --4 penalty to AC for 10 minutes
  7     +1 morale bonus on attacks and on saves against fear for 10 minutes
  8     Gain effects of *blur* for 10 minutes
  9     +1 insight bonus on all attacks, saves, and checks for 1 hour
  10    Gain effects of *freedom of movement* for 1 hour
  11    Gain one *limited wish* (must be used within 1 minute)
  12    Gain 10,000 XP and may roll again next round
  ----- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

No character can gain any effect from an additional roll of the dice
within 24 hours, with two exceptions. If a 2 is rolled, the dice
automatically roll themselves at the beginning of the character's next
turn and he or she must accept the additional result. If a 12 is rolled,
the character may choose to roll again in the next round (if more than 1
full round elapses between the roll of 12 and this bonus roll, the
character loses the bonus roll). There is no method (mundane or magical)
to predict or influence the result of a roll of *Rogue's dice.*Even
powerful divination magic can't predict the outcome of a roll before it
is made.

*Caster Level:* 20th; *Weight:* ---.

## Major Artifacts

**Axe of the Dwarvish Lords:** This is a +*6 keen throwing goblinoid
bane dwarven waraxe*. Any dwarf who holds it doubles the range of his or
her darkvision. Any nondwarf who grasps the *Axe* takes 2 points of
temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed or restored in
any way while the *Axe* is held. The current owner of the *Axe* gains a
+10 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing, blacksmithing, gemcutting,
stonemasonry, and weaponsmithing) checks. The wielder of the *Axe* can
summon an elder earth elemental (as *summon monster IX;* duration 20
rounds) once per week.

**Codex of the Infinite Planes:** The *Codex* is enormous---supposedly,
it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are
turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the *Codex* for the first
time is utterly annihilated, as with a *destruction* spell (Fortitude DC
30 for only 10d6 damage). Those who survive can peruse its pages and
learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the
*Codex* allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn
one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1
circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a
power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to
make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven
insane (as the *insanity* spell). The powers of the *Codex of the
Infinite Planes* are as follows: *astral projection, banishment,
elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding,
plane shift,* and *soul bind.* Each is usable at will by the owner of
the *Codex* (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the
power). The *Codex of the Infinite Planes* has a caster level of 30th
for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw
DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires both a
Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell
level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any
failure on either check indicates a catastrophe befalls the user (roll
on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one
catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails both checks.

  --------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d%        Catastrophe
  01--25    Natural Fury: An *earthquake* spell centered on the reader strikes every round for 1 minute, and an intensified *storm of vengeance* spell is centered and targeted on the reader.
  26--50    Fiendish Vengeance: A *gate* opens and 1d3+1 balor demons, pit fiends, or similar evil outsiders immediately step through and attempt to destroy the owner of the *Codex.*
  51--75    Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader's soul is captured (as *trap the soul;* no save allowed) in a random gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body is entombed beneath the earth (as *imprisonment).*
  76--100   Death: The reader utters a *wail of the banshee* and then is subject to a *destruction* spell. This repeats every round for 10 rounds until the reader is dead.
  --------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Cup and Talisman of the Demigod:** The *Cup* is a large gem-set golden
chalice requiring two hands to lift. It emits light (as the *daylight*
spell) at all times and automatically dispels any darkness-based spells
whose area it enters. If the cup is filled with holy water (requiring a
full gallon), that substance will act as a *potion of cure critical
wounds* or a *potion of neutralize poison* (owner's choice) if drunk.
This liquid can't be saved or stored in any way. The *Talisman* is a
small eight-pointed platinum star hanging from a chain of gold and
pearls. The wearer gains a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma and may cast
*remove blindness/deafness, remove curse,* and *remove disease* at will.
Furthermore, if the *Talisman* is placed within the *Cup* and the *Cup*
filled with holy water, that liquid acts as a special elixir of
*resurrection* (as the spell). This effect will function only once per
month. Any evil or chaotic creature that touches the *Cup* or *Talisman*
is struck with a *holy word* (if evil) or *dictum* (if chaotic) spell
(or both if the creature is chaotic evil).

**Eye of the Orc:** This lump of rock has a marquis-cut black sapphire
set in its center, making it appear similar to a large eye. If possessed
by an orc, it grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma,
and the orc's darkvision range is doubled. Nonorcs who possess the *Eye*
gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength but take a --2 penalty to
Intelligence and Charisma. Regardless of the owner's race, any weapon
wielded by the owner of the *Eye* is considered an *elf bane
weapon.*Furthermore, by holding the *Eye* before the character, he or
she can perceive things as if he or she had *true seeing* cast upon him
or her. This can be activated only once per day but lasts as long as the
character concentrates on it (requiring a standard action each round).

**Golem Armor:** This enormous suit of black iron +*10 full plate armor*
increases the wearer's size by one category (to a maximum of Colossal).
The wearer gains a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength and is rendered
immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, disease, and similar effects.
He or she is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability
damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. *Golem Armor* is
immune to rust attacks. The wearer of *Golem Armor* gains damage
reduction 15/adamantine. He or she also cannot regain hit points by any
means (mundane or magical) while the armor is worn. It requires 1 hour
to don or extract oneself from *Golem Armor.*

**Invulnerable Coat:** The *Invulnerable Coat* +*5 chain shirt of heavy
fortification.*It grants its wearer damage reduction 10/epic and
resistance 20 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic energy.
If the wearer can turn undead, treat the wearer as having +4 class
levels for purposes of caster level, turning undead, smiting evil, and
laying on hands.

**Iron Gauntlet of War:** The *Gauntlet* grants a +8 enhancement bonus
to Strength. The wearer doubles the damage bonus on any smite attacks he
or she makes. If the wearer has the Leadership feat, the wearer's
Leadership score increases by +4, but the wearer can never attract or
keep followers or cohorts who are good or chaotic. Once per day, the
wielder can use *implosion* as a 20th-level caster (DC 23). The *Iron
Gauntlet of War* is intelligent (Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 24, Ego 26) and
lawful evil. It can communicate telepathically with its wearer, though
it cannot speak. It will always seek to dominate any wearer who isn't
lawful evil, forcing such an owner to commit lawful evil deeds (or else
find a more suitable wearer).

**Ring of Nine Facets:** This ring is set with a gem of nine facets,
each one in-scribed with a different incomprehensible rune. Each day at
sunrise, the gem turns to display a different facet. The active facet
determines the *Ring's*power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 to
determine which facet (and thus which power) is active.

  ------ ---------------------------------------------------
  1d10   Active Facet Power
  1      Wearer is immune to disease
  2      Wearer needs no air to survive
  3      Wearer gains +5 natural armor bonus
  4      Wearer gains low-light vision
  5      Wearer gains fast healing 1
  6      Wearer can *fly* at will
  7      Wearer gains cold resistance 30
  8      Wearer gains *freedom of movement*
  9      Wearer gains +5 resistance bonus on saving throws
  10     Wearer may select which facet is active
  ------ ---------------------------------------------------

The wearer of the *Ring* can, with a great deal of mental exertion,
attempt to change the active facet away from one he or she does not
desire. This requires a full-round action and a Concentration check (DC
50), and deals 2d6 points of nonlethal damage regardless of success. If
the save is successful, the new facet is determined randomly. If the
*Ring* is removed, the former wearer takes 2d6 points of nonlethal
damage each minute until it is replaced or until his or her nonlethal
damage exceeds his or her current hit points (though the nonlethal
damage resumes again immediately when the former wearer regains
consciousness).
