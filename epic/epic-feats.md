## Acquiring Epic Feats

Characters gain epic feats in the following ways:

At 21st level, and every three levels thereafter, the character may
select an epic feat in place of a nonepic feat.

Each character class gains bonus epic feats according to the class
description. These feats must be selected from the list of bonus epic
feats for that class.

## Prerequisites

Most epic feats have prerequisites. A character must have the listed
ability score, feat, skill, class feature, or base attack modifier in
order to select or use that feat. A character can gain an epic feat at
the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite, just as with
regular feats. A prerequisite expressed as a numerical value is a
minimum; any value higher than the one given also meets the
prerequisite. A character can't use an epic feat if he or she has lost a
prerequisite.

## Types of Epic Feats

Most epic feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them
as a group. Others may be item creation feats or metamagic feats, which
follow all the normal rules for such feats, except as specified in the
feat's description. In addition, some feats are defined as divine feats
or as wild feats. Such feats are described below.

### Divine Feats

The feats in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all
have as a prerequisite the ability to turn (or, in most cases, rebuke)
undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level or higher,
and any prestige class that has that ability. (An ability to turn other
creatures does not qualify a character to select one of these feats.)
Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to channel
positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead. Each use of a
divine feat costs the character one turn/rebuke attempt from his or her
number of attempts each day. If a character doesn't have any turn/rebuke
attempts left, he or she can't use the feat. Since turning or rebuking
is a standard action, activating any of these feats is also a standard
action.

### Wild Feats

The feats in this category share the characteristic of relating to the
ability to use *wild shape* as a druid. These feats require the
character to have the ability to use *wild shape* before acquiring the
feat.

### Epic Psionic Feats

Psionic characters can acquire epic "psionically flavored" feats. Some
feats require so much translation that converted feats are provided.
Whenever a feat concerns conferring or altering a spell in some fashion,
some translation must be done to use it with psionics. Sometimes this
translation is as straightforward as changing a few names. Translating
epic metamagic feats to epic metapsionic feats requires that Spellcraft
prerequisites be replaced with Psicraft. It also requires a little
math---instead of casting a spell at a higher level, a psionic character
pays more power points. For every spell slot one level higher than the
spell's actual level the metamagic feat requires, the metapsionic feat
requires a character to pay a power point cost equal to its standard
cost +2. Likewise, when a feat allows a spellcaster to "pay" one less
level to use a metamagic feat, the psionic version allows a character to
pay 2 power points less for a given metapsionic feat.

## Feats

### Additional Magic Item Space [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#additional-magic-item-space}

**Benefit:** Choose one type of magic item that has a limit on the
number a character can simultaneously wear and gain its benefit. The
character can now wear one more magic item of this type and also gain
its benefit.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a character is limited to one headband,
hat, or helmet; one pair of eye lenses or goggles; one cloak, cape, or
mantle; one amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab; one
suit of armor; one robe; one vest, vestment, or shirt; one pair of
bracers or bracelets; one pair of gloves or gauntlets; two rings; one
belt; and one pair of boots.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time
the character takes the feat, it applies to a new type of wearable magic
item.

### Armor Skin [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#armor-skin}

**Benefit:** The character gains a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor
Class, or his or her existing natural armor bonus increases by 1.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
stack.

### Augmented Alchemy [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#augmented-alchemy}

**Prerequisites:** Int 21, Craft(alchemy) 24 ranks.

**Benefit:** Whenever creating an alchemical item or substance, the
character can choose to make it more powerful than normal by adding +20
to the DC required to create it and multiplying its price by 5. If the
item or substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or
substance doesn't deal damage, double the duration of its effect. If the
item or substance doesn't deal damage and doesn't have a specific listed
duration (or has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of
its area. If the item or substance doesn't fit any of these categories,
then it cannot be affected by this feat. See the Craft (alchemy) skill
description.

### Automatic Quicken Spell [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#automatic-quicken-spell}

**Prerequisites:** Quicken Spell, Spellcraft 30 ranks, ability to cast
9th-level arcane or divine spells.

**Benefit:** The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level
spells as quickened spells without using higher-level spell slots. The
normal limit to the number of quickened spells a character may cast per
round applies. Spells with a casting time of more than 1 full round
can't be quickened.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a
character takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest
spell levels can now be quickened with no adjustment to their spell
slots. This feat doesn't increase the casting time for those spells that
normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic form.

### Automatic Silent Spell [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#automatic-silent-spell}

**Prerequisites:** Silent Spell, Spellcraft 24 ranks, ability to cast
9th-level arcane or divine spells.

**Benefit:** The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level
spells as silent spells without using higher-level spell slots.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a
character takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest
spell levels can now be silenced with no adjustment to their spell
slots. This feat doesn't increase the casting time for those spells that
normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic form. However,
since bard spells can't be enhanced with the Silent Spell feat, they
can't be affected by this feat either.

### Automatic Still Spell [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#automatic-still-spell}

**Prerequisites:** Still Spell, Spellcraft 27 ranks, ability to cast
9th-level arcane or divine spells.

**Benefit:** The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level
spells as stilled spells without using higher-level spell slots.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a
character takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest
spell levels can now be stilled with no adjustment to their spell slots.
This feat doesn't increase the casting time for those spells that
normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic form.

### Bane of Enemies [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#bane-of-enemies}

**Prerequisites:** Survival 24 ranks, five or more favored enemies.

**Benefit:** Any weapon the character wields against one of his or her
favored enemies is treated as a bane weapon for that creature type
(thus, its enhancement bonus is increased by +2 and it deals +2d6 points
of damage). This ability doesn't stack with similar abilities.

### Blinding Speed [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#blinding-speed}

**Prerequisite:** Dex 25.

**Benefit:** The character can act as if *hasted* for 5 rounds each day.
The duration of the effect need not be consecutive rounds. Activating
this power is a free action.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he
or she takes the feat, it grants an additional 5 rounds of *haste* per
day.

### Bonus Domain [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#bonus-domain}

**Prerequisites:** Wis 21, ability to cast 9th-level divine spells.

**Benefit:** Choose an additional domain from the character's deity's
domain list. The character now has access to that domain's spells as
normal for his or her domain spells and the domain's granted powers.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he
or she takes the feat, it applies to a different domain.

### Bulwark of Defense [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#bulwark-of-defense}

**Prerequisites:** Con 25, defensive stance 3/day.

**Benefit:** The character's defensive stance bonuses increase to +4
Strength, +6 Constitution, +4 resistance bonus on all saves, and +6
dodge bonus to AC.

### Chaotic Rage [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#chaotic-rage}

**Prerequisites:** Rage 5/day, chaotic alignment.

**Benefit:** Any weapon the character wields while in a rage is treated
as an anarchic weapon (it is chaos-aligned and deals an extra 2d6 points
of damage against creatures of lawful alignment). This ability does not
stack with similar abilities.

### Colossal Wild Shape [\[Wild\]\[Epic\]]{.small} {#colossal-wild-shape}

**Prerequisite:** The ability to *wild shape* into a Gargantuan
creature.

**Benefit:** The character can use his or her *wild shape* to take the
shape of a Colossal animal.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a character cannot *wild shape* into an
animal of greater than Huge size.

### Combat Archery [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#combat-archery}

**Prerequisites:** Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot.

**Benefit:** The character does not incur any attacks of opportunity for
firing a bow when threatened.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a character incurs an attack of
opportunity from all opponents who threaten him or her whenever he or
she uses a bow.

### Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor [\[Item Creation\]\[Epic\]]{.small} {#craft-epic-magic-arms-and-armor}

**Prerequisites:** Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Knowledge (arcana) 28
ranks, Spellcraft 28 ranks.

**Benefit:** The character can craft magic arms and armor which exceed
the normal limits for such items

### Craft Epic Rod [\[Item Creation\]\[Epic\]]{.small} {#craft-epic-rod}

**Prerequisites:** Craft Rod, Knowledge (arcana) 32 ranks, Spellcraft 32
ranks.

**Benefit:** The character can craft rods that exceed the normal limits
for such items.

### Craft Epic Staff [\[Item Creation\]\[Epic\]]{.small} {#craft-epic-staff}

**Prerequisites:** Craft Staff, Knowledge (arcana) 35 ranks, Spellcraft
35 ranks.

**Benefit:** The character can craft staffs that exceed the normal
limits for such items.

### Craft Epic Wondrous Item [\[Item Creation\]\[Epic\]]{.small} {#craft-epic-wondrous-item}

**Prerequisites:** Craft Wondrous Item, Knowledge (arcana) 26 ranks,
Spellcraft 26 ranks.

**Benefit:** The character can craft wondrous items that exceed the
normal limits for such items.

### Damage Reduction [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#damage-reduction}

**Prerequisite:** Con 21.

**Benefit:** The character gains damage reduction 3/--. This does not
stack with damage reduction granted by magic items or nonpermanent
magical effects, but it does stack with any damage reduction granted by
permanent magical effects, class features, or this feat itself.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he
or she gains the feat, his or her damage reduction increases by 3.

### Deafening Song [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#deafening-song}

**Prerequisites:** Perform 24 ranks, bardic music class feature.

**Benefit:** The character can use song or poetics to temporarily deafen
all enemies within a 30-foot spread from him or her. A successful
Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the character's class level + the
character's Charisma modifier) negates the effect. The deafening effect
lasts for as long as the character continues the deafening song. The
character can choose to exclude any characters from this effect. The
character may sing, play, or recite a deafening song while taking other
mundane actions, but not magical ones (see the bard's inspire courage
ability for more details). The character may keep up the deafening song
for a maximum of 10 rounds. Using the deafening song counts as one of
the character's uses of song or poetics for the day.

### Death of Enemies [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#death-of-enemies}

**Prerequisites:** Bane of Enemies, Survival 30 ranks, five or more
favored enemies.

**Benefit:** Any time the character scores a critical hit against one of
his or her favored enemies, it must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2
character's ranger class level + character's Wisdom modifier) or die
instantly.

**Special:** Creatures immune to critical hits can't be affected by this
feat.

### Devastating Critical [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#devastating-critical}

**Prerequisites:** Str 25, Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical
(chosen weapon), Overwhelming Critical (chosen weapon), Power Attack,
Weapon Focus (chosen weapon).

**Benefit:** Whenever the character scores a critical hit with the
chosen weapon, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2
character level + character's Strength modifier) or die instantly.
(Creatures immune to critical hits can't be affected by this feat.)

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
do not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a
different type of weapon.

### Dexterous Fortitude [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#dexterous-fortitude}

**Prerequisites:** Dex 25, slippery mind class feature.

**Benefit:** Once per round, when targeted by an effect that requires a
Fortitude saving throw, the character may make a Reflex save instead to
avoid the effect (evasion is not applicable).

### Dexterous Will [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#dexterous-will}

**Prerequisites:** Dex 25, slippery mind class feature.

**Benefit:** Once per round, when targeted by an effect that requires a
Will saving throw, the character may make a Reflex save instead to avoid
the effect (evasion is not applicable).

### Diminutive Wild Shape [\[Wild\]\[Epic\]]{.small} {#diminutive-wild-shape}

**Prerequisite:** Ability to *wild shape* into a Huge animal.

**Benefit:** The character can use *wild shape* to take the shape of a
Diminutive animal.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a character cannot *wild shape* into an
animal of smaller than Tiny size.

### Dire Charge [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#dire-charge}

**Prerequisite:** Improved Initiative.

**Benefit:** If the character charges a foe during the first round of
combat (or the surprise round, if the character is allowed to act in
it), he or she can make a full attack against the opponent charged.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a character may only make a single attack
as part of a charge.

### Distant Shot [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#distant-shot}

**Prerequisites:** Dex 25, Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Spot 20 ranks.

**Benefit:** The character may throw or fire a ranged weapon at any
target within line of sight, with no penalty for range.

### Dragon Wild Shape [\[Wild\]\[Epic\]]{.small} {#dragon-wild-shape}

**Prerequisites:** Wis 30, Knowledge (nature) 30 ranks, *wild shape*
6/day.

**Benefit:** The character may use *wild shape* to change into a dragon
(black, blue, green, red, white, brass, bronze, copper, gold, or
silver). The size limitation is the same as the character's limitation
on animal size. The character gains all extraordinary and supernatural
abilities of the dragon whose form he or she takes.

### Efficient Item Creation [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#efficient-item-creation}

**Prerequisites:** Item creation feat to be selected, Knowledge (arcana)
24 ranks, Spellcraft 24 ranks.

**Benefit:** Select an item creation feat. Creating a magic item using
that feat requires one day per 10,000 gp of the item's market price,
with a minimum of one day.

for each 1,000 gp of the item's market price.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
do not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a
different item creation feat.

### Energy Resistance [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#energy-resistance}

sonic). The character gains resistance 10 to that type of energy, or the
character's existing resistance to that type of energy increases by 10.

or nonpermanent magical effects.

type of energy is chosen, the effects stack.

### Enhance Spell [\[Metamagic\]\[Epic\]]{.small} {#enhance-spell}

dice (for spells that deal a number of dice of damage equal to caster
level) or by 5 dice (for spells that deal a number of dice of damage
equal to half caster level). An enhanced spell uses up a spell slot four
levels higher than the spell's actual level. This feat has no effect on
spells that don't specifically deal a number of dice of damage equal to
the caster's level or half level, even if the spell's effect is largely
dictated by the caster's level.

**Normal:** Without this feat, use the damage dice caps indicated in the
spell's description.

**Special:** A character may gain this feat multiple times. Each time he
or she selects this feat, the damage cap increases by 10 dice or 5 dice,
as appropriate to the spell, and the enhanced spell takes up a spell
slot an additional four levels higher.

  : Table: Epic Leadership

**Leadership Score:** A character's Leadership score equals his or her
level plus any Charisma modifier. Outside factors can affect a
character's Leadership score, as detailed in the Leadership feat.

**Cohort Level:** The character can attract a cohort of up to this
level. Regardless of the character's Leadership score, he or she can't
recruit a cohort of his or her level or higher.

**Number of Followers by Level:** The character can lead up to the
indicated number of characters of each level.

\*The maximum cohort level increases by 1 for every 2 points of
Leadership above 40. \*\*The number of 1st-level followers increases by
100 for every point of Leadership above 40.

†A character can command one-tenth as many 2nd-level followers as
1st-level followers. A character can command one-half as many 3rd-level
followers as 2nd-level followers, one-half as many 4th-level followers
as 3rd-level followers, and so on (round fractions up, except any
fraction less than 1 rounds to 0). A character can't have a follower of
higher than 20th level.

good cohorts for epic characters.

paladins, and rangers; or Charisma for bards and sorcerers) may receive
bonus spells of those levels, as shown on Table: Expanded Ability
Modifiers and Bonus Spells, but only if they already have at least one
spell slot of that level (such as from the Improved Spell Capacity
feat). A character without any spell slots of a level can't receive any
bonus spells of that level, even if the appropriate ability score is
high enough to award them.

Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell
slots up to 25th level, the progression continues infinitely in both
directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th
level, expand the table to follow the same patterns as shown.

  : Table: Expanded Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells

### Improved Spell Resistance [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#improved-spell-resistance}

**Prerequisite:** Must have spell resistance from a feat, class feature,
or other permanent effect.

**Benefit:** The character's spell resistance increases by +2.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
stack.

### Improved Stunning Fist [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#improved-stunning-fist}

**Prerequisite:** Dex 19, Wis 19, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning
Fist.

**Benefit:** Add +2 to the DC of the character's stunning attack.

**Special:** This feat may be taken multiple times. Its effects stack.

### Improved Whirlwind Attack [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#improved-whirlwind-attack}

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, Dex 23, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility,
Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, the character can make one melee
attack for every five points of his or her base attack bonus (including
epic attack bonus, round fractions down).

The character cannot attack any one opponent more than once as part of
this action. These attacks (as well as all other attacks made until the
start of the character's next turn) suffer a --4 penalty.

When using the Improved Whirlwind feat, the character also forfeits any
bonus or extra attacks granted by other spells or abilities (such as
Cleave or the haste spell).

Since these attacks are made as part of a standard action the character
can't make a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.

**Normal:** Without this feat, using the Whirlwind Attack feat requires
a full attack action, and the character can take a 5-foot step between
any two of the attacks.

### Incite Rage [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#incite-rage}

**Prerequisites:** Cha 25, greater rage class feature.

**Benefit:** When the character enters a rage, he or she can incite a
barbarian rage in any or all allies within 60 feet. (Any ally who
doesn't wish to become enraged is unaffected.) The ally gains +4 to
Strength, +4 to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but
takes a --2 penalty to AC, for as long as the character remains raging.
The rage of affected allies lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + their
Constitution modifier, regardless of whether they remain within 60 feet
of the character. This is otherwise identical with normal barbarian rage
(including the fatigue at its end).

**Special:** This is a mind-affecting effect.

### Infinite Deflection [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#infinite-deflection}

**Prerequisites:** Dex 25, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Improved
Unarmed Strike.

**Benefit:** The character may perform any number of deflections each
round, as the Deflect Arrows feat.

### Inspire Excellence [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#inspire-excellence}

**Prerequisite:** Perform 30 ranks, bardic music class feature.

**Benefit:** The character can use song or poetics to grant a bonus to
one ability score to his or her allies. To be affected, an ally must
hear the bard sing for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the
bard sings and for 5 rounds after the bard stops singing (or 5 rounds
after the ally can no longer hear the bard). While singing, the bard can
fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion
(such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command word (such as
wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4 competence bonus to the same
ability score, which the character must choose before he or she begins
inspiring. Inspire excellence is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability.
Use of this feat counts as one of the character's bardic music uses for
the day.

**Special:** This feat is treated as a bardic music inspiration ability
for purposes of feats that affect such abilities.

### Instant Reload [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#instant-reload}

**Prerequisite:** Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Weapon Focus (crossbow type
to be selected).

**Benefit:** The character may fire the selected type of crossbow at his
or her full normal attack rate. Reloading the crossbow does not provoke
attacks of opportunity.

**Special:** A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
do not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a
different type of crossbow.

### Intensify Spell \[Metamagic\][\[Epic\]]{.small} {#intensify-spell}

**Prerequisites:** Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Spellcraft 30 ranks,
ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells.

**Benefit:** All variable, numeric effects of an intensified spell are
maximized, then doubled. An intensified spell deals twice maximum
damage, cures twice the maximum number of hit points, affects twice the
maximum number of targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Saving throws
and opposed rolls are not affected. An intensified spell uses up a spell
slot seven levels higher than the spell's actual level. A character
can't combine the effects of this feat with any other feat that affects
the variable, numeric effects of a spell.

### Keen Strike [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#keen-strike}

**Prerequisites:** Str 23, Wis 23, Improved Critical (unarmed strike),
Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning fist, *ki* strike (adamantine).

**Benefit:** The character's unarmed strike has a critical threat range
of 18-20 and deals slashing damage (at the character's option any attack
can deal bludgeoning damage, but cannot then take advantage of the
enhanced threat range). This ability doesn't stack with other abilities
that expand that character's unarmed strike's threat range.

burst), but it only turns undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the
character's effective cleric level minus 10 (and automatically destroys
undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the character's effective
cleric level minus 20). Just as with normal turning, the character can't

the feat, you can give your psicrystal knowledge of a new power (and it

knows as you desire.

the character cam cast. The character is attuned to the magic he or she
chooses. If another spellcaster within 300 feet of the character uses
this magic, the character also immediately gains the magic's effect as
if it had been used on the character by the same caster. The character
must have direct line of effect to the spellcaster in order to gain the
benefit of the attuned magic (though the character does not have to know
the spellcaster is present, and he or she can be flat-footed). The
magic's duration, effect, and other specifics are determined by its

feat.

### Tenacious Magic [\[Epic\]]{.small} {#tenacious-magic}

**Prerequisites:** Spellcraft 15 ranks.

**Benefit:** Choose one spell the character knows or spell-like ability
the character possesses. Whenever the chosen form of magic would
otherwise end due to a *dispel* effect, the magic is instead only

expires, but the suppressed rounds do not count against its duration.
The character can dismiss his or her own spell or spell-like ability (if
dismissible) or dispel his or her own tenacious magic normally.

can only rend once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks
he or she makes.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 21, base attack bonus +11, Point Blank Shot,

(though the character can't animate more undead than there are available
corpses within range). The character can't animate more undead with any
single attempt than the maximum number he or she can command (including
any undead already under his or her command). These undead are
automatically under the character's command, though his or her normal
limit of commanded undead still applies. If the corpses are relatively
fresh, the animated undead are zombies. Otherwise, they are skeletons.

These feats are not epic feats, so they may be selected by character any
time he or she could select a new feat.

attack with each weapon.

**Special:** This feat replaces the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat for
creatures with more than two arms.

### Improved Flyby Attack [\[General\]]{.small} {#improved-flyby-attack}

**Prerequisite:** Fly speed, Dodge, Flyby Attack, Mobility.

**Benefit:** If the standard action taken by a creature during a round
in which it uses Flyby Attack is a melee attack, the creature provokes
no attacks of opportunity from moving out of squares threatened by its
target.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a creature making an attack as part of a
Flyby Attack maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal from
moving out of squares threatened by its target.

### Improved Multiattack [\[General\]]{.small} {#improved-multiattack}

**Prerequisite:** Three or more natural weapons, Multiattack

**Benefit:** The creature's secondary attacks with natural weapons have
no penalty. They still add only one-half the creature's Strength bonus,
if any, to damage dealt.

**Normal:** Without this feat, the creature's secondary natural attacks
have a --5 penalty (or a --2 penalty if it has the Multiattack feat).

### Improved Multiweapon Fighting [\[General\]]{.small} {#improved-multiweapon-fighting}

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, three or more arms, Multiweapon Fighting,
base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** In addition to the single extra attack a creature gets with
each extra weapon from Multiweapon Fighting, it gets a second attack
with each extra weapon, albeit at a --5 penalty.

**Normal:** With only Multiweapon Fighting, a creater can only get a
single attack with each extra weapon.

**Special:** This feat replaces the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat
for creatures with more than two arms.
