  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------

A genius loci is difficult to spot, since it looks like any other
section of landscape. A genius loci itself has no intelligence, but
rather "emulates" the sentience of any creature it currently enslaves
(see below), if any. Each genius loci has only a single enslaved
creature at one time, though other creatures may also inhabit the
surface of the genius loci. Any creature entering a genius loci who
makes a successful Survival check (DC 31) realizes that something is
amiss, though it is difficult to tell exactly what. Genius loci do not
speak directly, though they may do so through their currently enslaved
thrall.

### Combat {#genius-loci--combat}

A genius loci can directly attack any creature standing on its surface
with animated parts of itself, delivering slam attacks. It also directs
its enslaved thrall against those it attacks. If its slave is slain, it
selects another of its foes as its next, newest slave. Once a genius
loci animates a portion of itself to attack the boundaries of its form
become clear, and the creature becomes open to attack (Survival checks
to determine the extent of the genius loci are no longer necessary). The
animated part of the genius loci has a reach of 15 feet.

**Enslave (Su):** A genius loci can use the epic spell *enslave* once
per round as a free action until it successfully enslaves a foe (Will DC
53 to resist). The DC is Charisma-based. Once it has a slave, it cannot
enslave another until its current slave dies, is *imprisoned,*or is
otherwise incapaticiated. A slave becomes free if its genius loci master
is slain. A genius loci forces its slave to remain with it, though it
may send its slave off to temporarily visit nearby locations in order to
draw in unsuspecting victims. In fact, the "purposes" of the genius loci
are to some degree influenced by the current slave. The genius loci has
no Intelligence score of its own; thus, its emulation of its slave's
intelligence sometimes transfers attitudes and goals. However, a slave
can only go so far in influencing its mobile master, and cannot
knowingly attempt to free itself from the genius loci that keeps it
close.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If the genius loci hits a Gargantuan or smaller
creature with a slam attack, it deals normal Damage and attempts to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. The genius loci has the option to conduct the grapple
normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the improved
grab to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during
successive rounds automatically deals slam attack Damage, in addition to
constriction Damage.

**Constrict (Ex):** A genius loci crushes its opponent, dealing 4d10+30
points of bludgeoning Damage, after making a successful grapple check.

**Ooze Traits:** An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature. Oozes are
immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. They
have no clear front or back and are therefore not subject to critical
hits or flanking. Oozes are blind but have the blindsight special
quality. They have no Intelligence scores and are therefore immune to
all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns,
and morale effects).

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A gibbering orb can speak all languages.

A gibbering orb's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#gibbering-orb--combat}

The gibbering orb has the ability to bite its foes by extending a
pseudopod with one of its mouths protruding from the end. The orb can
extend four of these at any one foe, or a total of twelve in any given
round. At the same time, the legions of eyes have the ability to cast a
host of spells at a rapid rate.

**Gibbering (Su):** The cacophony of speech emanating from the scores of
mouths that make up the orb forces all within 60 feet of the creature to
succeed at a Will save each round (DC 40) or suffer the effects of an
*insanity* spell.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, the gibbering orb must hit
with a bite attack. If it gets a hold, the orb automatically deals bite
Damage and can attempt to swallow whole.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** A gibbering orb can attempt to swallow a Large
or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside,
the opponent takes 4d8 points of constriction Damage plus 3d10 points of
acid Damage per round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using
claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 20 points of Damage in a single
blow (AC 16, DR 10/epic still applies). Once the creature exits, the
fluidlike body structure of the orb closes the wound; other swallowed
opponents must cut their own way out. When a creature dies by being
swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some
other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature's
known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use
any two of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates
from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see below) that round.
Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.

**Eye Rays (Su):** Two dozen of the eyes can each produce a magical ray
each round, with each eye emulating a spell from among the list of
spells below as if cast by a 27th-level caster. The save DCs, where
applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional
limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes
orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a
gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target,
due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 feet. Each of
these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of
the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target
and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: *cone of cold,
disintegrate, dominate monster, energy drain, feeblemind, finger of
death, flesh to stone, greater dispelling, harm, hold monster, horrid
wilting, implosion, inflict critical wounds, lightning bolt, magic
missile, mage's disjunction, irresistible dance, polymorph any object,
power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, prismatic spray,
slay living,* and *temporal stasis.*

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---Two stolen spells or spell-like
abilities per round. Caster level 27th, save DC 16 + spell level.

**All-Around Vision (Ex):** The gibbering orb's many eyes give it a +4
racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.

**Flight (Ex):** The gibbering orb's body is naturally buoyant. This
buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of
20 feet. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent *feather fall* effect
with personal range.

**Amorphous (Ex):** A gibbering orb is not subject to critical hits. It
has no clear front or back, so it cannot be flanked.

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the hand of any other creature but a gloom, the dagger is a *+5 keen
dagger.*

A gloom's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#gloom--combat}

**Fear Gaze (Su):** Viewing the gloom's face inspires terror. Creatures
that meet the gloom's gaze must succeed at a Will save (DC 32) or suffer
the effects of a *fear* spell as cast by a 20th-level caster. The DC is
Charisma-based.

**Opportunist (Ex):** This ability functions like the rogue class
feature of the same name.

**Sneak Attack (Ex):** A gloom is able to sneak attack as a 25th-level
rogue, dealing 13d6 extra Damage.

**Quiescence (Su):** A gloom is constantly silent, as per the *silence*
spell, although the area does not extend beyond the creature itself.
This quality gives it a +20 racial bonus on Move Silently checks (it is
still possible for a gloom to create noise, such as by bumping into
something that scrapes on the floor or by sounding a chime). The gloom
can lower this effect at will.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*shadow walk;* 3/day--- *true
strike.* Caster level 20th; save DC 20 + spell level. The DC is
Charisma-based.

### Mithral Golem

A mithral golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have
any distinguishable odor. Unlike most golems, it can run just as well as
a normal creature.

A mithral golem's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

#### Combat {#mithral-golem--combat}

**Alacrity (Su):** Once per round, the mithral golem may take an extra
standard action (either before or after its other actions in the round).

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** A mithral golem is immune to all magical and
supernatural effects, except as follows. A *slow* spell negates its
alacrity for 1d4 rounds, while a *haste* spell restores 1d6 hit points
per level of the caster (maximum 10d6) or restores its alacrity, if
previously negated by a *slow* spell. Multiple *slow* spells simply
extend the duration of the effect.

### Construction {#golem--construction}

A mithral golem's body is sculpted from 8 1/2 tons of pure iron and is
then polymorphed into mithral (using *polymorph any object).*A mithral
golem costs 250,000 gold pieces to create, which includes 5,000 gp for
the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft
(armorsmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) check (DC 30). The creator
must be 25th level, have the Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor feat, and
be able to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 5,000 XP
from the creator and requires *geas/quest, haste,* and *wish.*

### Adamantine Golem

An adamantine golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it
have any distinguishable odor.

An adamantine golem's natural weapons are treated as epic for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

#### Combat {#adamantine-golem--combat}

**Trample (Ex):** As a standard action during its turn each round, the
adamantine golem can literally run over an opponent at least one size
category smaller than itself. The trample deals 8d10+30 points of
bludgeoning Damage. Trampled opponents can either attempt attacks of
opportunity at a --4 penalty or Reflex saves (DC 57) for half Damage.
The DC is Strength-based.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** An adamantine golem is immune to all magical
and supernatural effects.

#### Construction {#adamantine-golem--construction}

An adamantine golem's body is sculpted from 45,000 pounds of pure iron
and is then polymorphed into adamantine (using *polymorph any
object).*The golem costs 500,000 gold pieces to create, which includes
25,000 gp for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft
(armorsmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) check (DC 40). The creator
must be 30th level, have the Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor feat, and
be able to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 10,000 XP
from the creator and requires *crushing hand, geas/quest,* and *wish.*

A hagunemnon's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#hagunemnon--combat}

**Psionics (Sp):** At will *---detect thoughts, dimension door, ethereal
jaunt, knock, nondetection, plane shift, suggestion.*Caster level 20th,
save DC 22.

**Destabilize Form (Su):** If a protean hits with two or more slam
attacks in the same round, it partly destabilizes its foe's physical
form, dealing an additional 4d6+31 points of Damage as well as 2 points
of temporary Constitution Damage. If the victim is drained to 0
Constitution, its dead body is only so much clear fluid that drains away
unless somehow preserved by friends of the victim.

**Alter Shape (Ex):** A protean can assume the shape of any combination
of physical nondeific creatures at the same time as a free action. In
fact, a protean's form constantly boils, and it requires a
move-equivalent action each round for a protean to maintain a certain
shape (even if that shape is a combination of several shapes). Whatever
its present form, the protean retains all its own special qualities.
Plus, it gains the advantage of up to four extraordinary abilities from
the forms it mimics (but not spell-like or supernatural powers). The
assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no larger than 200 feet
in its largest dimension (make sure to take into account rules for reach
and size modifiers to AC and melee attacks). Incorporeal traits can also
be assumed, which counts as a single extraordinary ability. If a
hagunemnon assumes a partial form that confers an extraordinary ability
already possessed by the creature, only the better of the two abilities
is retained. No matter its form, the protean can never make more than
five attacks using a full-round action. However, it may substitute a
melee attack form for one of its slam attacks, using its own base attack
bonus and Strength modifier to Damage, but dealing base Damage
appropriate to the attack type.

A hoary hunter's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#hoary-hunter--combat}

A critical hit (or the blow that would kill or render a foe unconscious)
from the hoary hunter's blade does not wound the hunter's prey. Instead,
the victim is bodily transported as per a *soul binding* spell
heightened to 16th level (DC 30) into a diamond at the end of the
sword's hilt.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*discern location, true strike, fog
cloud, hold monster, plane shift;* 3/day---*dimensional anchor, dominate
monster, greater dispel magic;* 1/day---mage's *disjunction, contingent
recall and resurrection\*.* Caster level 23rd; save DC 18 + spell level.
*\*Contingent recall and resurrection* is a variation on an epic spell.
When slain, the hoary hunter is actually transported, with its mount,
back to the fey realm, where it is resurrected. The only way to truly
slay the hoary hunter is to defeat it in its home realm after this epic
spell has been exhausted for the day.

### Hoary Steed

A hoary steed's natural weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

#### Combat {#hoary-steed--combat}

**Air Walk (Su):** A hoary steed can ride through the air as well as on
the ground, as though affected by a permanent *air walk* spell.

**Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su):** These abilities function
just like the spells of the same names as cast by a 20th-level caster.

**Magic Circle Against Good (Su):** This ability continuously duplicates
the effects of the spell. A hoary steed cannot suppress this ability.

**Misty Breath (Su):** The breath of a hoary steed functions like a
constant *obscuring mist* spell.

**Immunities (Ex):** A hoary steed is immune to all *charm* and *hold*
spells or abilities.

Hunefers speak all spoken languages, though it takes one 1d4 rounds to
switch between languages.

### Combat {#hunefer--combat}

**Despair (Su):** The mere sight of a hunefer requires viewers to
succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 48) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4
rounds. Regardless of the outcome of the save, a subject is not again
vulnerable to that hunefer's despair ability for 24 hours. The DC is
Charisma-based.

**Hunefer Rot (Su):** Supernatural disease---slam, Fort save (DC 35),
incubation period instantaneous; Damage 1d6 temporary Con. Unlike normal
diseases, hunefer rot requires a victim to make a successful saving
throw every round or take another 1d6 points of temporary Constitution
Damage. The rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and
dies) or receives a *remove disease* spell or similar magic. An
afflicted creature that dies shrivels away into sand unless both *remove
disease* and *raise dead* (or better) are cast on the remains within 2
rounds. If the remains are not so treated, on the third round the dust
swirls and forms an 18 HD mummy with the dead foe's equipment under the
hunefer's command. (The *mummy dust* epic spell has statistics for an 18
HD mummy.)

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*chain lightning, displacement,
haste, knock, greater dispel magic, passwall, scrying, greater teleport,
true seeing, unholy aura, weird;* 1/day---*ruin* (epic spell). Caster
level 27th; save DC 23 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning,
disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects,
and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual dam-age, ability Damage,
ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of
death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.
Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature
is willing.

Lavawights speak Common and Infernal.

### Combat {#lavawight--combat}

**Rend (Ex):** If the lavawight hits with both of its claws, it latches
onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically
deals an additional 6d8+31 points of Damage.

**Blazefire (Su):** Living creatures taking Damage from a lavawight's
attack find themselves ignited with blaze-fire; they must succeed at a
Fortitude save (DC 35) or permanently lose 4 hit points. The DC is
Charisma-based. The opponent must continue to save every round for the
next 6 rounds (7 rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of 4
more hit points each round. The lavawight heals the same amount of
Damage whenever a creature is drained of hit points, gaining any excess
as temporary hit points. Tehse temporary hit points last a maximum of 1
hour. If an opponent is slain by blazefire, only blackened ash remains
of the victim. Hit points lost to the blazefire never heal naturally and
cannot be magically restored---they are gone for good.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will--- *dimension door, flame arrow, spell
immunity (sleet storm*), *fireball, wall of fire.* Caster level 22nd;
save DC 19 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning,
disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects,
and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage,
ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of
death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.
Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature
is willing.

**Heat Aura (Su):** A 10-foot-radius spread heat aura surrounds a
lavawight. All creatures of the fire subtype in the field (including the
lavawight) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if undead) and
fast healing 10. Creatures subject to fire Damage take 2d10 points of
fire Damage each round they remain within the heat aura.

**Fire Subtype:** Fire immunity, cold vulnerability..

**Fiery Hardness (Ex):** The lavawight's molten skin provides it with
Damage reduction of 10/--.

A leshay's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#leshay--combat}

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*alter self, detect thoughts,
displacement, freedom, greater dispelling, heal, greater invisibility,
knock, speak with plants, spell turning, greater teleport, water
breathing.* Caster level 28th; save DC 28 + spell level. The DCs are
Charisma-based.

**LeShay Weapons (Su):** Each leShay carries two personal melee weapons
that he or she manifests from his or her own life essence. The weapon
can change form as he or she shifts from class to class, typically
appearing as a bastard sword (one in each hand). When not in combat, the
weapons simply do not exist, but leShay can "draw" their weapons from
nowhere as a free action. LeShay weapons are considered light weapons
for a leShay, regardless of their size.

**Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex):** A leShay fights with a leShay
weapon in each hand. Because these weapons are extensions of its own
body, the leShay does not take an attack or Damage penalty for attacking
with two weapons.

**Gaze (Su):** All creatures within 30 feet who meet the gaze of a
leShay become affected as if by *charm monster.*A Will save (DC 53)
negates the effect. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must
attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in
the initiative order. A leShay can also actively gaze as an attack
action by choosing a target within range, who must then attempt a saving
throw. LeShay are immune to their own gaze. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Elf Traits:** Immune to magic *sleep* spells and effects; +2 racial
bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells or effects; low-light
vision (can see twice as far as a human in low-light conditions);
entitled to a Search check when within 5 feet of a secret or concealed
door as though actively looking for it; Martial Weapon Proficiency
(composite longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, longsword, and rapier)
as bonus feats; +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and Search checks
(already figured into the statistics given above).

To access a vault, its creator must call the vault from where it is
sequestered through the use of a *sending* spell. The vault has no
obvious opening; however, items can be stored and retrieved by naming
them (the living vault provides an inventory to its creator on request).
The item to be stored appears to sink into the living vault's form as if
made of mud. Likewise, items retrieved pop out of the living vault's
form. Storing and retrieving items in this fashion takes one round per
transaction. Creatures other than the vault's master who wish to access
the inventory must destroy the vault to do so. If a vault is destroyed,
all the objects and creatures stored within immediately emerge.

A living vault's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#living-vault--combat}

***Imprisonment* (Sp):** As a free action twice per day, a living vault
can project a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone must make a
Will save (DC 58) or be affected as by the *imprisonment* spell, except
creatures are stored within the vault's interior. The living vault can
hold two Gargantuan creatures, eight Huge creatures, thirty-two Large
creatures, one hundred twenty-eight Medium-size creatures, and so on.
This assumes that the rest of the vault is also relatively empty, so a
large hoard of treasure reduces the number of creatures a living vault
can hold at any one time. If *freedom* is later cast upon the very spot
where the victim of *imprisonment* disappeared, the victim is freed,
though it doesn't appear where it disappeared, but in a space adjacent
to wherever the living vault is currently physically located.

**Recognition (Ex):** Once made, a living vault responds only to its
owner; no other being can access the vault's interior. The vault is not
fooled by disguised creatures, and can distinguish between its true
master and false duplicates, even penetrating disguises used in
conjunction with *shapechange, alter self, disguise self, polymorph,
seeming,* and *simulacrum* and similar effects. The vault does, however,
respond to the product of a *clone* spell.

***Safekeeping* (Sp):** At will, a living vault can use a power that
combines the effects of *sequester* and *plane shift* to render the
vault invisible to any form of sight or divination, and at the same time
transfer it to a random portion of the Astral Plane. When in safekeeping
mode, the living vault responds to a *sending* by its master, returning
to the location from which it left and becoming tangible once again.
Creatures and objects that are stored within the vault are treated as if
under the effects of *sequester,* whether the vault itself is or not.
Often, creatures are brought into the vault via *imprisonment,* but
sometimes unconscious or otherwise subdued creatures are stored as an
object, in which case they receive no saving throw to resist the effect.

**Construct Traits:** Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and to poison,
*sleep,* paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic
effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also
works on objects. Cannot heal Damage (though regeneration and fast
healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, subdual
Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of
death from massive Damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or
less; cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** A living vault is immune to all magical and
supernatural effects, except as follows. A *freedom* spell cast on it
causes it to defer the use of its own *imprisonment* power for 10
rounds.

Mu spores speak Common and Terran.

A mu spore's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#mu-spore--combat}

**Spore Cough (Su):** Once every 1d4 rounds a mu spore can release a
cloud of burrowing spores. This spore cough is treated as a
100-foot-cone breath weapon. The burrowing spores deal 20d8 points of
Damage to all creatures and structures in the area, or half Damage to
any creatures that make a Reflex save (DC 36). The DC is Charisma-based.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If a mu spore hits with a tendril, it deals
normal Damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. Improved grab works only against
Gargantuan and smaller opponents. The mu spore has the option to conduct
the grapple normally, transfer the victim to its mouth as a free action,
or simply use its tendril to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple
check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the Damage
given for the tendril.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** If the mu spore begins its turn with an opponent
held in its mouth, it can attempt a new grapple check (as though
attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey
and the opponent takes bite Damage. A swallowed creature takes the twice
the Damage given for the mu spore's bite every round. A swallowed
creature is considered grappled, while the creature that did the
swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with
any light piercing or slashing weapon, if it can deal 33 points of
Damage in this fashion, or it can just try to escape the grapple. If the
swallowed creature chooses the latter course, success puts it back in
the mu spore's mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

**Sticky (Ex):** Sticky tendrils cover a mu spore, many more than the
four main tendrils it uses for combat. Any creature that touches or
successfully attacks a mu spore with a melee weapon is subject to a free
improved grab check by the mu spore, as if the mu spore had
success-fully attacked the creature with a tendril. A creature wielding
a melee weapon must immediately relinquish its grip on its weapon, or
proceed with the grapple check. If the subject relinquishes its grip on
its weapon, the weapon is swallowed the following round. Creatures who
attack the mu spore in melee without a weapon they can release (such as
those with natural attacks only) do not have this option.

**Plant Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning, and
polymorphing; not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects.

A creature whose brain has been harvested by a brain collector cannot be
raised, reincarnated, or resurrected while the brain is in the creature,
because the collector preserves and draws upon the soul and basic
personality of the creature for as long as it retains the brain.
Neh-thalggus' own language is a silent sign language "spoken" with their
writhing head-tentacles. They can also communicate telepathically with
any creature that has a language within 100 feet.

A neh-thalggu's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#neh-thalggu--combat}

**Poison (Ex):** A neh-thalggu's bite injects a debilitating poison (DC
32) that Damages the victim's Constitution. He or she loses half his or
her current Constitution immediately on a failed save and must save
again 1 minute later or lose half of his or her remaining Constitution.
If the character survives, he or she heals the ability Damage at the
normal rate (1 point per day). The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Head-Tentacles (Ex):** The long, whiplike tentacles that frame either
side of a brain collector's face can deliver a dangerous touch attack
that, if successful, causes the target to dehydrate and wither (2d10
points of desiccation Damage). In addition, each successful tentacle
attack drains 1 point of Strength, 1 point of Dexterity, and 1 point of
Constitution. This is permanent ability drain and may only be reversed
by spells such as *restoration* and *greater restoration.*It can bring
all ten tentacles to bear on a single target facing it or divide its
attacks against up to ten targets that it threatens.

***Extract Brains* (Sp):** Once every 1d4 rounds, as a full-round
action, a brain collector can extract the brain from a target creature
in line of sight. This attack is psionic in nature and can be blocked by
a *dimensional anchor* currently in force on the target. The target gets
a Will save (DC 31) to resist the extraction. The save DC is
Intelligence-based. If the save fails, his or her brain is drawn out
intact through the skull by extradimensional means and sucked up by the
brain collector, lodging in an unused storage sac above and behind its
eyes. If the save succeeds, he or she takes 9d6 points of Damage and is
stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A brain collector prefers to absorb brains of
high-level arcane spellcasters but is fully capable of extracting those
of other foes as a highly effective attack. When encountered, assume a
neh-thalggu has a full retinue of thirteen stolen brains. Each brain
less than the full thirteen bestows one negative level on the
neh-thalggu (though these never convert to actual level loss), which is
a powerful incentive for the creature to always keep its brain-sacs
filled. A neh-thalggu is free to draw on all the Knowledge skills of
each brain it currently stores, using the base ranks in a skill
possessed by each brain, and adjusted by the neh-thalggu's own skill
modifiers for the Knowledge skill in question (or its Intelligence
modifier, for a skill it has no ranks in).

***Dimensional Travel* (Sp):** A brain collector's preferred method of
locomotion is via *dimension door,* which it can do as a quickened
action, once per round. It can also use *teleport without error* or
*plane shift* at will as a move-equivalent action.

**Spells (Sp):** A fully grown brain collector can cast arcane spells as
a 13th-level sorcerer (one level of spell-casting ability per brain).

**Incorporeal:** A neh-thalggu is not wholly in our reality but always
remains partially extradimensional. Thus it can be harmed only by other
incorporeal creatures, +1 or better weapons, magic, or psionics, with a
50% chance to ignore any Damage from a corporeal source. It can pass
through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor
(except for its bite attack, which is treated as if a corporeal attack).
It always moves silently unless it chooses otherwise.

**Amorphous Physiology (Ex):** A brain collector does not have fixed
organs. As such, it is immune to critical hits, death from massive
Damage, sneak attacks, and coup de grace.

**Manifest Maw:** Though it is an incorporeal creature, a neh-thalggu
can manifest its mouth in corporeal form as a standard action. While so
manifested, the mouth can deliver bite attacks against corporeal
creatures or pick up objects. The mouth bites as if it had Str 35.

**Feats:** A neh-thalggu gains Power Attack as a bonus feat, even though
it has no Strength score.

## Paragon Creature

### Creating a Paragon Creature

"Paragon" is a template that can be added to any creature (referred to
hereafter as the base creature).

The base creature's type remains unchanged. The paragon creature uses
all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted
here.

**HD:** A paragon creature always has maximum hit points. Paragon
creatures also gain an additional 12 hit points per HD.

**Speed:** A paragon creature's speed triples, for all movement types.

**AC:** Paragon creatures gain a +12 insight bonus to AC and a +12 luck
bonus to AC. They also gain a +5 natural armor bonus (if the creature
already has natural armor, use whichever is better).

**Attacks:** A paragon creature makes all its attacks with a +25 luck
bonus on the attack roll.

**Damage:** A paragon creature gains a +20 luck bonus on Damage rolls
for all melee and thrown ranged attacks.

**Special Attacks:** A paragon creature's special attacks, if any, all
gain a +13 insight bonus, if applicable. The +13 insight bonus may only
be applied to a given special ability once.

**Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) or Psionics (Sp):** If the base creature has
spell-like abilities, it gains +15 to its caster level to use those
abilities. A paragon creature also gains the ability to use *greater
dispel magic, haste,* and *see invisibility* three times per day, even
if it did not have spell-like abilities before, at 15th caster level.

**Special Qualities:** A paragon creature retains all the special
qualities of the base creature and also gains the following.

-   Fire and cold resistance 10. If the creature already possesses such
    resistance, use whichever is better.
-   Damage reduction 10/epic. If the creature already possesses Damage
    reduction, use whichever is better.
-   Spell resistance equal to the paragon creature's CR +25. If the
    creature already possesses spell resistance, use whichever is
    higher.
-   Fast healing 20. If the creature already possesses fast healing, use
    whichever is better.
-   A paragon creature's natural weapons are treated as epic for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Saves:** The paragon creature gains a +10 insight bonus on all its
saving throws.

**Abilities:** All ability scores are 15 points higher than those of the
base creature.

**Skills:** The paragon creature gains a +10 competence bonus on all its
skill checks.

**Feats:** Same as the base creature, plus one bonus feat.

**Climate/Terrain:** Any land and underground.

**Organization:** Same as the base creature.

**Challenge Rating:** As base creature +15.

**Treasure:** Standard for a creature of the adjusted CR.

**Alignment:** Same as the base creature.

**Advancement:** Same as the base creature.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Combat {#prismasaurus--combat}

**Prismatic Emanations (Su):** The reflected and refracted light from
the prismasaurus's crystalline ridge functions very similarly to the
*prismatic spray* spell. Any creature of less than 8 HD that is within
30 feet of the creature is automatically blinded for 2d4 rounds. In
addition, any creature within 20 feet of the prismasaurus is randomly
struck by one or more rays of light, as determined by the table that
accompanies the *prismatic spray* spell. This effect is as the
*prismatic spray* spell in a 30-foot-radius spread, but is otherwise as
cast by a 20th-level caster. The save DC for the *prismatic spray*
effects is 49.

**Immunities (Su):** It is immune to poison, gases, petrification, and
mind-affecting attacks.

**Prismatic Blur (Ex):** The reflected and refracted light that
constantly surrounds the creature blurs the creature's outline and makes
it difficult to properly target. All melee and ranged attacks against
the creature have a 50% miss chance.

Pseudotrolls speak Giant.

A pseudotroll's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#pseudonatural-troll--combat}

**Constant Insight (Su):** A pseudotroll makes all its attacks
(including grapples) with a +15 insight bonus (calculated into the above
statistics). The creature is not affected by the miss chance that
applies to attacks against a concealed target.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If a pseudonatural troll hits an opponent
smaller than it with a tentacle, it deals normal Damage and attempts to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity.

**Rend (Ex):** If a pseudotroll hits with two or more tentacle rake
attacks, it latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This
attack automatically deals an additional 4d8+25 points of Damage, and
can be used concurrently with its improved grab ability.

**Rotting Constriction (Ex):** Once a pseudotroll has hold of an
opponent, each successful grapple check it makes during subsequent
rounds automatically drains 2d4 points of Constitution. At the same
time, the pseudotroll regains 10 lost hit points.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Fire and acid deal normal Damage to a
pseudotroll. If a pseudotroll loses a tentacle or body part, the lost
portion regrows in 1 minute. The creature can reattach the severed
member instantly by holding it to the stump.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*blur, dimension door, shield,
unhallow.* Caster level 20th; save DC 8 + spell level. The DC is
Charisma-based.

**Alternate Form (Su):** At will, a pseudotroll can take the form of a
grotesque, tentacled mass (or another appropriately gruesome form), but
all its abilities remain unchanged despite the alien appearance.
Changing shape is a standard action. Other creatures receive a --1
morale penalty on their attack rolls against a pseudotroll in this
alternate form.

## Creating a Pseudonatural Creature

"Pseudonatural" is a template that can be added to any corporeal
creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

**Size and Type:** The creature's type changes to outsider
(extraplanar). Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill
points. Size is unchanged.

**HD:** A pseudonatural creature always has maximum hit points.

**Speed:** A pseudonatural creature's speed doubles, for all movement
types.

**AC:** Pseudonatural creatures gain a +35 natural armor bonus. If the
creature already has an armor bonus, use whichever is better.

**Attack/Full Attack:** A pseudonatural creature substitutes tentacle
rake attacks for its melee attacks while in pseudonatural form. These
tentacle attacks always use the creature's best attack bonus. It also
gains additional tentacle rake attacks (also at its best attack bonus)
as noted on the table below.

**Damage:** Tentacle rakes from a pseudonatural creature deal Damage
equal to 2d8 + Str modifier.

**Special Attacks:** A pseudonatural creature retains all the special
attacks of the base creature and also gains the following.

***Constant Insight (Su):***The creature makes all its attacks with a
+15 insight bonus. The creature is not affected by the miss chance that
applies to attacks against a concealed target.

***Improved Grab (Ex):***If the creature hits an opponent smaller than
it with a tentacle, it deals normal Damage and attempts to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

***Rotting Constriction (Ex):***Once the creature has hold of an
opponent, each successful grapple check it makes during subsequent
rounds permanently drains 2d4 points of Constitution. At the same time,
the creature regains 10 lost hit points.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*blur, dimension door, shield,
unhallow.* Caster level 20th. The DCs are Charisma-based.

**Special Qualities:** A pseudonatural creature retains all the special
qualities of the base creature and also gains the following.

-   Electricity and acid resistance of a varying amount related to its
    Hit Dice (see the table below). If the creature already possesses
    such resistance, use whichever is better.
-   Damage reduction of a varying amount related to its Hit Dice (see
    the table below). If the creature already possesses Damage
    reduction, use whichever is better.
-   Spell resistance equal to the creature's HD x5. If the creature
    already possesses spell resistance, use whichever is higher.
-   One extra tentacle rake attack (the creature can use another of its
    many tentacles to attack at no penalty while in pseudonatural form)
    for each 4 HD the creature has.
-   A pseudonatural creature's natural weapons are treated as epic for
    the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

  ---------------- --------------------------------- ------------------ -----------------------------
  Hit Dice         Electricity and Acid Resistance   Damage Reduction   Extra Tentacle Rake Attacks
  1--3             15                                5/epic             1
  4--7             20                                5/epic             2
  8--11            25                                10/epic            3
  12--15           30                                10/epic            4
  16--19           35                                15/epic            5
  21--24           40                                15/epic            6
  each 4 more HD   +5                                15/epic            +1
  ---------------- --------------------------------- ------------------ -----------------------------

If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use
the better value.

***Alternate Form (Su):***At will, a pseudonatural creature can take the
form of a grotesque, tentacled mass (or another appropriately gruesome
form), but all its abilities remain unchanged despite the alien
appearance. Changing shape is a standard action. Other creatures receive
a --1 morale penalty on their attack rolls against pseudonatural
creatures in this alternate form.

**Saves:** Same as the base creature.

**Abilities:** Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +22, Con
+10, Dex +10, Wisdom +10, Intelligence at least 3.

**Skills:** Same as the base creature.

**Feats:** Same as the base creature.

**Climate/Terrain:** Any land and underground.

as base creature +13; 16+ HD, as base creature +10

**Treasure:** Same as the base creature.

**Alignment:** Same as base creature.

**Advancement:** Same as the base creature.

  Alignment:             Always neutral
  Advancement:           None
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

### Combat {#ruin-swarm--combat}

**Blinding (Ex):** Any living creature that begins its turn with a ruin
swarm in its space must make a Fortitude save (DC 51) or be blinded for
one round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

**Blindsense (Ex):** The ruin swarm notices and locates creatures within
200 ft. Opponents still have 100% concealment against the swarm (but
swarm attacks ignore concealment).

**Distraction (Ex):** Any living creature vulnerable to the swarm's
damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for
1 round; a DC 45 Fortitude save negates the effect. Even with a
successful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area
of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using
skills requiring patience and concentration requires a Concentration
check (DC 20). The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Swarm Traits:** A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable
anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made
up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing
weapons.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the swarm to break up,
though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to
attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a
dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull
rushed, and they cannot grapple another.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number
of creatures (including single-target spells such as *disintegrate*),
with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an
intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes a --10 penalty on
saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as
many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect attack
does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double damage instead.

A swarm rendered unconscious by means of subdual damage becomes
disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its hit points
exceed its subdual damage.

**Vermin Traits:** A ruin swarm is immune to all mind-affecting effects
(charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). It also
has darkvision (60-foot range).

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A shadow of the void's natural weapons are treated as epic for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#shadow-of-the-void--combat}

**Blightfire (Su):** Living creatures taking Damage from a shadow of the
void's incorporeal touch attack find themselves ignited with blightfire;
cold, black flames cascade over their bodies, and they must succeed at a
Fort save (DC 37) or permanently lose 6 points of Constitution. The
opponent must continue to save every round for the next 6 rounds (7
rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of 6 more Con points.
The creature heals 30 points of Damage whenever it drains 6 points of
Constitution, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These
temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the opponent is slain
by blight-fire, only icy fragments of the victim remain, until they
reform as a winterwight. The save DC is Charisma-dased.

**Create Spawn (Su):** Any humanoid slain by a shadow of the void
becomes a winterwight in 1d4 rounds. Winterwights are under the command
of the shadow of the void that created them and remain enslaved until
its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life,
though they do possess general knowledge of the slain creature. This
knowledge is used for evil purposes, if possible.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day---*deeper darkness, freezing sphere.*
Caster level 24th; save DC 20 + spell level. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

**Incorporeal Traits:** Can be harmed only by other incorporeal
creatures, magic weapons, or magic, with a 50% chance to ignore any
Damage from a corporeal source. Can pass through solid objects at will,
and own attacks pass through armor. Always moves silently.

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning,
disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects,
and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage,
ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of
death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.
Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature
is willing.

**Cold Subtype:** Immunity to cold. Vulnerability to fire, (takes half
again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a
saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure).

**Cold Aura (Su):** A 10-foot-radius spread cold aura surrounds a shadow
of the void. All creatures of the cold sub-type in the area (including
the shadow of the void) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if
undead) and fast healing 10. Creatures subject to cold Damage take 2d10
points of cold Damage each round they remain within the cold aura.

A shape of fire's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#shape-of-fire--combat}

**Blazefire (Su):** Living creatures taking Damage from a shape of
fire's incorporeal touch attack find them-selves ignited with blazefire;
white-hot, lambent flames cascade over their bodies, and they must
succeed at a Fort save (DC 37) or permanently lose 10 hit points. The
opponent must continue to save every round for the next 6 rounds (7
rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of 10 more hit points
each round. The shape of fire heals the same amount of Damage whenever a
creature is drained, gaining any excess hit points as temporary hit
points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the
opponent is slain by blazefire, only blackened ash remains of the
victim. Hit points lost to the blazefire never heal naturally and cannot
be magically restored---they are gone for good. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

**Create Spawn (Su):** Any humanoid slain by a shape of fire becomes a
lavawight in 1d4 rounds. Lavawights are under the command of the shape
of fire that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do
not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day---*fire storm, incendiary cloud.* Caster
level 24th; save DC 20 + spell level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Incorporeal Traits:** Can be harmed only by other incorporeal
creatures, magic weapons, or magic, with a 50% chance to ignore any
Damage from a corporeal source. Can pass through solid objects at will,
and own attacks pass through armor. Always moves silently.

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning,
disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects,
and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage,
ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of
death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.
Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature
is willing.

**Fire Subtype:**Immunity to fire. Vulnerability to cold (takes half
again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a
saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure).

**Heat Aura (Su):** A 10-foot-radius spread heat aura surrounds a shape
of fire. All creatures of the fire subtype in the area (including the
shape of fire) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if undead)
and fast healing 10. Creatures subject to fire Damage take 2d10 points
of fire Damage each round they remain within the heat aura.

Sirrushes speak Sylvan and Draconic.

A sirrush's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#three-headed-sirrush--combat}

**Stunning Roar (Ex):** Every 1d4 rounds, a sirrush can loose a sonic
attack of such volume that it stuns all creatures in a 60-foot spread
for 1d4 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw (DC 47, or DC 51
for a three-headed sirrush). The DC is

**Pounce (Ex):** If a sirrush charges or leaps upon a foe during its
first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already
taken a move action.

**Headloss Resistance (Ex):** A sirrush's thick bony plate protects its
neck like a shield and provides resistance from effects that could
normally behead it, such as a vorpal weapon. When a sirrush or
three-headed sir-rush would otherwise lose its head, it instead makes a
Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 HD of attacker + attacker's Str
modifier). On a failed save, the sirrush's head leaves its shoulders
normally, but on a successful save, the sirrush is unaffected by the
beheading. A sirrush dies when beheaded; a three-headed sirrush goes on
fighting until all its heads are lost (the only penalty it incurs is one
or two fewer bite attacks when it makes a full attack).

A tayellah's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#tayellah--combat}

2d10 temporary Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move
action.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, the tayellah must hit with
two of its claw attacks. If it gets a hold, it can rake.

**Rake (Ex):** A tayellah that gets a hold can make two additional rake
attacks (+44 melee) with legs it normally only uses for walking, dealing
4d6+5 points of Damage each. If the tayellah pounces on an opponent, it
can also rake.

Thorciasids speak Common, Elven, Dwarven, and Giant.

A thorciasid's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#thorciasid--combat}

**Cocoon (Ex):** A thorciasid can eject a stream of noxious goo that
hardens on contact, potentially fixing a subject in place and hindering
its movement and actions. Using a standard action, the thorciasid makes
a ranged touch attack against any foe it can see up to 60 feet away. If
it succeeds at the ranged touch attack, the subject makes a grapple
check against the cocoon. This is accomplished as if the thorciasid
itself were making the grapple check with a competence bonus of +10, for
a total check modifier of +37. On a failed check for the subject, the
goo hardens into a partial cocoon, and the victim is treated as if
grappled (even though the thorciasid is free to do as it desires). The
subject can attempt to break the grapple of the cocoon (or use Escape
Artist) each round, making an opposed grapple check against the cocoon
(check modifier +37 for the cocoon). A thorciasid can reinforce a
partial cocoon by spending a standard action secreting additional goo.
Each action so spent provides an additional +5 to the cocoon's grapple
check modifier. Visually, the victim becomes more and more covered and
is finally com-pletely encased in a cocoon. Even fully encased victims
can still breathe, and a thorciasid can drain a victim's life force at
its leisure.

**Ability Drain (Su):** On a successful melee touch attack with a
forelimb, the thorciasid permanently drains 1d4+1 points of Strength,
1d4+1 points of Dexterity, and 1 point of Constitution from the victim.
The thorciasid regains 20 lost hit points with each successful ability
drain.

**Energy Drain (Su):** On a successful melee touch attack with an
antenna, the thorciasid gives the victim one negative level. Each
negative level bestowed upon a victim gives the thorciasid +1 bonus to
its Constitution that lasts for 24 hours. The negative levels similarly
last for 24 hours, at which time the victim must make a Fortitude saving
throw (DC 34) to avoid level loss. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Combat {#treant-elder--combat}

***Animate Trees* (Sp):** An elder treant can animate trees within 500
feet at will, controlling up to six trees at a time. It takes a full
round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves and fights
as a treant in all physical respects. Animated trees lose their ability
to move if the elder treant who animated them is incapacitated or moves
out of range.

**Trample (Ex):** An elder treant can trample Gargantuan or smaller
creatures for 8d20+40 points of Damage. Opponents who do not make
attacks of opportunity against the elder treant can attempt a Reflex
save (DC 54) to halve the Damage. The save DC is Strength-based.

**Triple Damage against Objects (Ex):** An elder treant that makes a
full attack against an object or structure deals triple Damage.

**Plant Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning, and
polymorphing; not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects.

**Skills:** Elder treants receive skills as though they were fey. \*They
have a +24 racial bonus on Hide checks made in forested areas.

### Combat {#umbral-blot--combat}

**Disintegrating Touch (Ex):** Any material object that comes into
contact with a blackball is immediately disintegrated unless it succeeds
at a Fortitude save (DC 38). A character or object that has been
disintegrated by an umbral blot disappears completely, leaving behind
not even dust to mark its passing. Those who make a successful saving
throw still take 5d6 points of Damage from the disintegrating touch.
Likewise, weapons or objects that save take a like amount of Damage.
(Remember, tended or held objects save with the same bonus as their
owners.)

**Vortex (Ex):** Normally a blackball insulates itself somehow from the
air around it (otherwise it would perpetually be at the center of a
howling wind-storm). If it chooses, instead of allowing the air to bend
around it, the blackball can suspend this insulation, causing a sudden
rush of wind to pour toward the blackball from all directions. This
vortex sucks all the air from a 30-foot-by-30-foot-by-30-foot room in a
single round, creating a sudden influx of air in its direction. All
flying or floating creatures within 30 feet of the umbral blot who fail
a Reflex save (DC 38) are swept along with the wind into contact with
the blackball. Nonflying creatures within 30 feet who fail a Reflex save
(DC 19) are pulled into contact with the umbral blot. Contact with an
umbral blot could lead to disintegration, as noted above.

**Spell Immunities (Ex):** In addition to the spells that an umbral blot
is immune to because of its construct traits, it is immune to
*disintegration* spells and variations thereof.

**Planar Travel (Ex):** A blackball can fold space at will, allowing it
to use *ethereal jaunt, dimension door, greater teleport,* or *plane
shift* at will as a standard action.

**Construct Traits:** Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and to poison,
*sleep,* paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic
effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also
works on objects. Cannot heal Damage (though regeneration and fast
healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, subdual
Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of
death from massive Damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or
less; cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.

Uvuudaums can speak telepathically to any creature within 500 feet that
has a language.

A uvuudaum's natural weapons are treated as epic and evil for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#uvuudaum--combat}

**Confusion Aura (Su):** This ability operates continuously, as the
*confusion* spell but with a 30-foot radius. Potential victims can make
a Will save (DC 47) to resist confusion. Those affected by the aura can
make a new save every 4 rounds to throw off the effect. Once it has
successfully resisted, a subject remains immune to that uvuudaum's
confusion aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Wisdom Drain (Su):** This effect permanently reduces a living
opponent's Wisdom score by 2d4 points when the creature hits with its
head spike, or twice that amount on a critical hit. The creature regains
5 lost hit points (or 10 on a critical hit ) whenever it drains Wisdom,
gaining any excess hit points as temporary hit points. Thesse temporary
hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. An opponent can avoid the Wisdom
drain with a Fortitude save (DC 47). The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*confusion, dimension door, greater
dispel magic, displacement, haste, invisibility, lightning bolt, magic
missile, mage armor, polymorph, shield, stoneskin, true strike, web;*
3/day---*chain lightning, cone of cold, disintegrate, dominate person,
plane shift, prismatic spray, scrying, greater teleport, wall of force;*
1/day---*contingent resurrection, nailed to the sky, time duplicate*
(epic spells), *time stop.* Caster level 27th; save DC 28 + spell level.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Uvuudaums take normal damage from holy weapons,
cold, and fire.

Vermiurges speak Terran.

A vermiurge's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#vermiurge--combat}

**Aura of Doom (Su):** A vermiurge is constantly affected as if by a
*crown of vermin* spell (epic spell) cast by a 42nd-level caster. As per
the spell, a vermiurge may completely suppress the aura of insects as
desired. A vermiurge's aura of doom constantly replenishes itself at a
rate of 200 vermin per round (unlimited duration). When vermin die off
either by being slain or by dealing Damage to another creature, the aura
does not permanently collapse, even if all the vermin are slain or if
all 1,000 vermin deal their Damage in 1 round. As soon as any vermin are
replenished, they participate normally in the *crown of vermin* effect.

**Concealing Aura (Ex):** Its aura of doom constantly provides a
vermiurge with nine-tenths concealment, so all attacks made against it
have a 40% miss chance.

**Frightful Presence (Su):** This ability takes effect automatically
when the vermiurge first engages its aura of doom. It affects only
opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the creature has. The
affected creature must make a successful Will save (DC 48) or become
shaken. Success indicates that the target is immune to that creature's
frightful presence for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Poison (Ex):** Sting or bite, Fort save (DC 44); initial Damage 1d6
temporary Con, secondary Damage 2d6 temporary Con. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

Winterwights speak Common and Infernal.

A winterwight's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat {#winterwight--combat}

**Rend (Ex):** If the winterwight hits with both of its claws, it
latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack
automatically deals an additional 6d8+31 points of Damage.

**Blightfire (Su):** When a winterwight deals Damage to a living
opponent, a night-black flame begins to burn on the opponent's body. If
the opponent fails a Fortitude save (DC 35), it takes 4 points of
permanent Constitution drain. The opponent must continue to save every
round for the next 4 rounds (5 rounds total) to avoid being permanently
drained of an additional 4 points of Constitution per round. The
creature regains 10 lost hit points whenever it drains 4 points of
Constitution, gaining any excess hit points as temporary hit points.
These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the opponent is
slain by blightfire, only icy fragments of the victim remain. The save
DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*cone of cold, control weather,
dimension door, spell immunity (fireball*), *sleet storm* (a winterwight
is immune to the effects of a *sleet storm* spell), *wall of ice.*Caster
level 23rd; save DC 19 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning,
disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects,
and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage,
ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of
death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.
Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature
is willing.

**Cold Subtype:**Immunity to cold. Vulnerability to fire (takes half
again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a
saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure).

**Cold Aura (Su):** A 10-foot-radius spread cold aura surrounds a
winterwight. All creatures of the cold sub-type in the field (including
the winterwight) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if undead)
and fast healing 10. Creatures subject to cold Damage take 2d10 points
of cold Damage each round they remain within the cold aura.

A worm that walks rarely speaks, although it retains knowledge of all
languages it knew in life, as well as any it has learned since.

### Combat {#worm-that-walks--combat}

**Spells:** A worm that walks can cast any spells it could cast as a
character. This sample worm was a 23rd-level wizard (spells per day:
4/12/6/6/6/5/5/5/5/4/1/1). The last spell slots are 10th-level and
11th-level slots, respectively, and are available for 0--9th level
meta-magic spells.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 1/day---*animal growth* (vermin), *animal
messenger* (vermin), *animal shapes* (vermin), *animal trance* (vermin),
*colossal vermin* (as *giant vermin,*but it can increase the creature's
size from Large to Gargantuan and from Huge to Colossal), *creeping
doom, giant vermin, summon swarm* (vermin), *summon vermin* (as *summon
nature's ally,* except it summons 10 HD of vermin per level), and
*vermin plague* (as *insect plague).*Caster level 20th; save DC 9 +
spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Engulf (Ex):** A worm that walks can choose to engulf an opponent who
is no more than one size category larger than itself. The worm attempts
to embrace its victim, and with a successful melee touch attack, the
victim is immediately swallowed up and surrounded by a mass of vermin,
taking 100 points of damage. A victim who spends a full-round action can
break free of the embrace and move up to half its speed away from the
worm if desired, but can do nothing else. Otherwise, each round a victim
remains embraced, it takes another 100 points of Damage. Constructs are
immune to this attack.

**Spells:** The worm that walks can cast any spells it could cast when a
living character. It also gains several related abilities.

**Frightful Presence (Su):** When a worm that walks engulfs a victim,
witnesses must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the worm's HD + the worm's
Cha modifier). Those who make the save are shaken. Those who fail by 5
or fewer points are frightened. Those who fail by 6 to10 points are
panicked. Those who fail by 11 or more points are cowering. All these
conditions last for 1d4 rounds. Those who have seen a worm use this
attack before gain a +5 bonus on their saving throws. The victim of the
worm's engulf attack has a --5 penalty on his or her saving throw.

**Discorporate (Ex):** If gravely threatened, a worm can discorporate as
a free action, simply falling into a pile of individual vermin that
slither quickly away. So long as any of the component vermin survive,
they can breed and create a new body to house the wizard's intelligence
and personality. Discorporating is a dangerous tactic, because once
separated, the vermin are treated no differently than other vermin.
Also, the worm stands a good chance of losing all its equipment.
However, discorporation almost assures that at least one maggot (if not
dozens) will manage to crawl away, and so provide for the worm's
continued existence.

**Immunities (Ex):** A worm that walks has no discernable anatomy, so it
is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

**Possessions:** Scrolls of *fireball* (10th-level caster), greater
*teleport, acid fog, incendiary cloud, shapechange, wail of the banshee,
clenched fist, horrid wilting, maze, summon monster IX;potions of cure
serious wounds, alter self, haste, fly.* Other magic gear: *amulet of
natural armor +2, bracers of armor +8, ring of protection +3, +4 staff*,
*rod of absorption, gloves of Dexterity +4, headband of intellect +6,
pink Ioun stone, wings of flying.*

## Creating a Worm That Walks

"Worm that walks" is a template that can be added to any evil wizard or
sorcerer. It uses all the original character's statistics, special
abilities, and equipment, except as noted here.

**Type:** The character's type changes to aberration (it is a creature
composed of hundreds of discrete crawling worms).

**Hit Dice:** Increase to d8.

**AC:** The mass of worms that make up this creature, each looking out
for danger, in sum provide a +20 insight bonus to AC.

**Special Attack:** A worm that walks retains all the character's
special attacks. It also gains one special attack, engulf.

**Engulf (Ex):** A worm that walks can choose to engulf an opponent who
is no more than one size category larger than itself. The worm attempts
to embrace its victim, and with a successful melee touch attack, the
victim is immediately swallowed up and surrounded by a mass of vermin,
taking 100 points of Damage as the biting vermin nibble away. A victim
who spends a full-round action can break free of the embrace and move up
to half its speed away from the worm if desired, but can do nothing
else. Otherwise, each round a victim remains embraced, it takes another
100 points of Damage. Constructs are immune to this attack.

**Spells:** A worm that walks can cast any spells it could cast as a
living character.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 1/day--- *animal growth* (vermin), *animal
messenger* (vermin), *animal shapes* (vermin), *animal trance* (vermin),
*colossal vermin* (as *giant vermin,*but it can increase the creature's
size from Large to Gargantuan and from Huge to Colossal), *creeping
doom, giant vermin, summon swarm* (vermin), *summon vermin* (as *summon
nature's ally,* except it summons 10 HD of vermin per level), and
*vermin plague* (as *insect plague).*Caster level 20th.

it had in life and gains those mentioned below.

***Blindsight (Ex):***Worms that walk have blindsight 300 ft.

***Spell Resistance (Ex):***A worm that walks has spell resistance equal
to its Challenge Rating +10.

***Frightful Presence (Su):***When a worm that walks engulfs a victim,
witnesses must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the worm's HD + the worm's
Cha modifier). Those who make the save are shaken. Those who fail by 5
or fewer points are frightened. Those who fail by 6 to 10 points are
panicked. Those who fail by 11 or more points are cowering. All these
conditions last for 1d4 rounds. Those who have seen a worm use this
attack before gain a +5 bonus on their saving throws. The victim of the
worm's engulf attack has a --5 penalty on his or her saving throw.

***Discorporate (Ex):***If gravely threatened, a worm can discorporate
as a free action, simply falling into a pile of individual vermin that
slither quickly away. So long as any of the component vermin survive,
they can breed and create a new body to house the wizard's intelligence
and personality. Discorporating is a dangerous tactic, because once
separated, the vermin are treated no differently than other vermin.
Also, the worm stands a good chance of losing all its equipment.
However, discorporation almost assures that at least one maggot (if not
dozens) will manage to crawl away, and so provide for the worm's
continued existence.

**Immunities (Ex):** A worm that walks has no discernable anatomy, so it
is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

**Alignment:** Any evil.

**Advancement:** By character class.

### Worm That Walks Characters

By making eldritch preparations on a burial plot, a powerful spellcaster
can improve the likelihood of a worm that walks emerging from the
ground. The body is buried in an elaborate ritual that, the spellcaster
hopes, will attract a critical mass of worms or maggots. The spellcaster
performing the ritual must spend 10,000 gp in rare reagents for the
ceremony. Furthermore, the ritual drains 2,000 XP from the spell-caster
and requires the following spells: *limited wish, polymorph any object,
summon swarm* (heightened to 7th level),and *sympathy.* Even if the
ritual is performed correctly, there is only a chance that the deceased
spellcaster will arise as a worm that walks. For each prepared but
uncast arcane spell the deceased had at the moment of death (or unused
spell slots if a spontaneous caster), there's a 1% chance that a worm
that walks will slither from the grave soil in 1d4 days. Some worms that
walk arise spontaneously from ordinary burial plots, but such an event
is exceedingly rare. And an epic spell can create worms that walk every
time without fail.

When this spell is cast, worms or maggots slither and crawl their way
inexorably toward the corpse touched. Over the course of the next week,
they consume the flesh of the corpse, and when the last bit of the
corpse is devoured, the creature is returned to a semblance of life as a
worm that walks.
