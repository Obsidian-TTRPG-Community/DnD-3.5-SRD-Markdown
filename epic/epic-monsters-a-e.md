## Abomination

### Building Abominations

Abominations are a grouping of the outsider type in the same way that
demons are a grouping of the outsider type. The accompanying table
indicates the average values an abomination of a given size might have
for its basic physical scores. Abominations also share several other
characteristics.

  ------------- -------- -------- -------- ------------- ------ ------ ------ ------

#### Abomination Traits

All abominations are born directly (or indirectly) from a god and some
lesser creature (or idea), but none are favored, wanted, or loved.
Still, they all share a tiny spark of deific energy, which grants them
the qualities described in below. (Note: deity rules are used,
abominations are rank 0 deities.)

**Immunities (Ex):** Abominations are immune to polymorphing,
petrification, or any form-altering attack. They are not subject to
energy drain, ability drain, or ability damage. They are immune to
mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects), and are immune to one of five energy types (specific to
the abomination).

**Resistances (Ex):** Abominations have fire resistance 20, cold
resistance 20, and damage reduction of at least 10/epic (certain
abominations have higher damage reduction). Abominations all have
significant spell resistance. Abominations resist detection, and are all
treated as if affected by a *nondetection* spell of a caster level equal
to the abomination's HD.

**Special Qualities (Ex):** All abominations have the spell-like ability
to use *true seeing* at will. Abominations are not subject to death from
massive damage, and they have maximum hit points per Hit Die.
Abominations have the blindsight extraordinary ability to a range of 500
feet. Abominations can choose both nonepic and epic feats as part of
their feat selection.

**Telepathy (Su):** Abominations can communicate telepathically with any
creature within 1,000 feet that has a language.

***Summon Creature* (Sp):** Abominations can summon creatures associated
either with the portfolio of their godly progenitor or with their
imprisonment. Summoned creatures serve the abomination without question.
Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour,
or sooner if slain. See specific abomination entries for additional
details on summoning.

**Fast Healing and Regeneration:** Most abominations have some measure
of fast healing and regeneration, ranging from 5 to 55 for both
abilities. Usually, higher HD abominations have higher values for fast
healing and regeneration, though this not always the case. If an
abomination has regeneration, it is usually subject to normal damage
from at least two sources, one of which is the antithesis for their
subtype, and the other of which is somehow tied to some unique feature
of the abomination.

**Natural Armor:** All abominations have some degree of natural armor
bonus ranging from +10 to +100. Usually, higher HD abominations have
higher natural armor bonuses, but this is not always the case.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** All abominations have access to a variety of
spells in the form of spell-like abilities, which they can use as 20th-
or higher-level casters, depending on the abomination. No rule governs
how many or how few spell-like abilities an abomination may claim.

**Unique Abilities:** All abominations have at least one or more unique
abilities tied to their godly parent's portfolio, or to the manner of
their incarceration.

**Spell Resistance:** As a general rule of thumb, abominations have
spell resistance equal to their CR +12.

Abominations speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and often a language
associated with their imprisonment.

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An atropal's natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and
lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*animate dead, blasphemy, create
greater undead, create undead, cone of cold, desecrate, greater
dispelling, finger of death, improved invisibility, plane shift, slay
living, speak with dead, spectral hand, teleport with-out error, unholy
aura;*5/day---*haste, project image, weird.* Caster level 30th; save DC
26 + spell level.

The save DCs are Charisma-based

**Rebuke/Command Undead (Su):** Atropals can rebuke or command undead as
a cleric with a level equal to the atropal's HD + 6.

**Negative Energy Aura (Su):** A 30-foot-radius spread negative energy
aura spreads from each atropal. All undead in the field (including the
atropal) are treated as if having turn resistance +20 and a negative
energy version of fast healing 20. Living creatures in the aura are
treated as having ten negative levels unless they have some sort of
negative energy protection or protection from evil. Creatures with 10 or
fewer HD or levels perish (and, at the atropal's option, rise as
spectres under the atropal's command 1 minute later).

**Constitution Drain (Su):** When the atropal hits a living opponent
with a touch attack, the opponent takes 5 points of permanent
Constitution drain, or 10 points on a critical hit. The atropal heals 20
points of damage, or 40 points on a critical hit, whenever it drains
Constitution, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These
temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. The attack allows a
Fortitude save (DC 59). The DC is Charisma-based.

**Energy Drain (Su):** When the atropal hits with a ranged touch attack
(a ray of darkness that it shoots from one eye to a range of 400 feet),
the resultant energy drain bestows four negative levels, or eight
negative levels on a critical hit. For each negative level bestowed on
an opponent, the atropal heals 10 points of damage, or 20 on a critical
hit, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit
points last a maximum of 1 hour. After 24 hours have passed, the
afflicted opponent must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 59) for each
negative level. If successful, the negative level goes away with no harm
to the creature; otherwise, the creature's level decreases by one. The
DC is Charisma-based.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Atropals take normal damage from good weapons or
sentient weapons (or otherwise living weapons).

***Summon Nightcrawler* (Sp):** Five times per day an atropal can summon
a nightcrawler.

**Abomination Traits:** Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other
form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain,
ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true
seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning,
disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects,
and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,
ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of
death from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.
Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature
is willing.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A dream larvas's natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and
chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat

**Worst Nightmare (Su):** Each time a living creature first views a
specific dream larva from a distance of 30 feet or less (or from a
scrying effect), the subject sees the image of the most fearsome
creature imaginable. This is not an illusion or phantasm; the dream
larva truly becomes, for just that instant, the subject's worst
nightmare. Even if simultaneously viewed by dozens of different
creatures, the dream larva appears differently to each one of them.
Creatures immune to fear or mind-affecting effects (or warded by
*protection from evil* or *death ward* spells) are immune to worst
nightmare; all others must make a Will save (DC 43) or die from the
supernatural horror revealed. Survivors (and those resurrected) are
immune to the effect from that individual dream larva in the future. The
DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*fly, haste, nightmare, prismatic
spray;* 2/day---*dreamscape*(epic spell). Caster level 31st; save DC
23 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If the dream larva hits with a claw or pincer,
it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. Dream larvae can use
improved grab on a creature of any size. The dream larva has the option
to conduct the grapple normally, simply use the claw or pincer to hold
the opponent, or use sending (see below) on the opponent. Each
successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically
deals the damage listed for the attack that established the hold, unless
it used sending on the victim.

**Sending (Su):** Grappled victims may be physically sent into a
nightmare, at the dream larva's option, on the dream larva's next action
after establishing the grapple. Victims must make a Will save (DC 43) or
be apparently swarmed by thousands of worms making up the dream larva's
body. The victim is actually cast into a shrieking maelstrom of dream
where it can take no actions but observe. The victim physically returns
2d4 rounds later, apparently ejected from the dream larva's body (but
appearing even if if the dream larva has left or is otherwise absent).
The victim of the nightmare has taken 4d6 points of temporary Wisdom
damage, but is otherwise free to act on the round it returns. If the
victim takes more Wisdom damage than it has points of Wisdom, the extra
points are instead treated as temporary Constitution damage. The DC is
Charisma-based.

***Summon Nightwalker* (Sp):** Five times per day, a dream larva can
summon a nightwalker.

**Abomination Traits:** Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other
form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain,
ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true
seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Dream larvae take normal damage from good or
lawful weapons or weapons forged by a sleepwalking weaponsmith.

A hecatoncheires' natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and
chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat

**Superior Multiweapon Fighting (Ex):** A hecatoncheires fights with a
greatsword or a boulder in each hand. The hecatoncheires does not suffer
an attack or damage penalty for attacking with one hundred weapons.
However, the press of limbs prevents the creature from making iterative
attacks with any of its arms, nor can it make more than ten attacks
against a Small or smaller creature, fifteen attacks against a
Medium-size creature, or twenty attacks against a Large creature in the
same action (it can make all its attacks against a Huge or larger
creature in one action).

**Skills:** A hecatoncheires' fifty heads give it a +50 racial bonus on
Listen, Spot, and Search checks.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will--- *greater magic weapon, fly,
shield.* Caster level 50th; save DC 17 + spell level. The DC is
Charisma-based.

***Summon Hecatoncheires* (Sp):** A hecatoncheires can summon one other
hecatoncheires once per day, though is loath to do so because then it
will be similarly obligated to answer its sibling's summoning. A
summoned hecatoncheires cannot use its summoning power while "summoned."

**Abomination Traits:** Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other
form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain,
ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true
seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Hecatoncheires take normal damage from good
weapons or weapons tempered with the blood of a deity.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An infernal's natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and
chaotic-aligned or lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

### Combat

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If an infernal hits with a claw, it deals normal
damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. Infernals can use this ability on
Large and smaller creatures. The infernal has the option to conduct the
grapple normally, or simply use its claw to hold the opponent. Each
successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically
deals standard claw damage, in addition to automatic spell suck damage.

**Spell Suck (Su):** If an infernal bites a foe, the foe loses one of
its highest-level prepared spells or one of the spell slots for this day
that it has not used. The victim chooses the prepared spell to lose. If
the victim has no prepared spells or unused spell slots (either because
it has exhausted its spellcasting for the day or because the victim is
not a spellcaster), the bite instead deals 2 points of temporary
Intelligence damage.

**Learned Spell Immunity (Su):** If an infernal is affected by a spell
cast by a particular spellcaster, the infernal thereafter becomes immune
to that spell when cast by that spellcaster.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*animate dead, blasphemy, blur,
charm person, create undead, darkness, deeper darkness, desecrate,
detect chaos, detect good, detect law, detect magic, fear, fireball,
greater dispel magic, hold person, greater invisibility, magic circle
against good, major image, produce flame, polymorph, pyrotechnics, read
magic, scrying, suggestion, symbol of death, telekinesis, greater
teleport* (self plus 1,000 pounds), *unholy aura, unholy blight,
unhallow, wall of fire;* *1/day---fire storm, hellball* (epic spell),
*implosion, meteor swarm.*Caster level 26th; save DC 19 + spell level.
The DCs are Charisma-based.

***Summon Fiend* (Sp):** An infernal can summon four balors or four pit
fiends per day (lawful infernals summon pit fiends, and chaotic
infernals summon balors).

**Abomination Traits:** Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other
form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain,
ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection ; true
seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Infernals take normal damage from good weapons.
Lawful infernals also take normal damage from chaotic weapons, and vice
versa.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A phaethon's natural weapons are treated as epic and evil for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat

**Fiery Touch (Ex):** Touching or being touched by a phaethon deals 2d6
points of fire damage.

**Fiery Overrun (Ex):** A foe who is successfully overrun by a phaethon
is treated as if swallowed whole.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If the phaethon hits with a pseudopod, it deals
normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. Phaethons can use improved grab on a
Huge or smaller creature. The phaethon has the option to conduct the
grapple normally, simply maintaining a pseudopod hold, or attempting to
absorb the opponent by swallowing the foe whole. Each successful grapple
check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage
listed for the pseudopod.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** The phaethon can absorb opponents it holds with
a second successful grapple check after a grab. The opponent must be
Huge or smaller. Absorbed creatures take 20d6 points of fire damage and
10d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round they remain inside a
phaethon. Victims must make a successful grapple check to "swim" free of
the living magma of the phaethon.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*fireball, fire storm, delayed blast
fireball, flame strike, wall of fire;* 1/day---*scrying.* Caster level

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A phanes' natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and chaotic-aligned
for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*detect good, detect magic, improved
invisibility* (self only); *5/day---haste, slow, greater teleport,
tongues, trap the soul, true strike, unholy aura; 2/day---safe time,
time duplicate* (epic spell); *1/day---time stop.* Caster level 21st;
save DC 21 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Stasis Touch (Su):** As *temporal stasis,* except as an at-will
supernatural ability. Caster level 25th; save DC 21 + spell level. The
DC is Charisma-based.

**Chronal Blast (Su):** As a standard action, the phane can make a
ranged touch attack against any creature within 100 feet. If it
succeeds, the subject is targeted by a spasm of space-time flux, dealing
15d6 points of damage.

**Time Leach (Su):** For every round of apparent time experienced by the
phane, it automatically absorbs the "future" from any creature it has
successfully encapsulated in static time via its stasis touch (not its
null time field), no matter the distance separating victim and phane,
and no matter the number of victims. Of course, to the victim no time
passes at all, but each apparent round experienced by the phane ages the
victim 1d4 years, at the same time healing the phane of 20 hit points of
damage. A victim who is not somehow released from static time by a
friend who can cast *dispel magic, greater dispel magic,* or some other
likely spell, eventually ages to death. Victims killed in this manner
automatically fall out of static time as desiccated husks that
disintegrate to a fine dust with even the lightest touch. Victims who
are released prior to death immediately apply the physical effects of
aging, but not the mental effects.

***Summon Past Time Duplicate* (Sp):** Once per day, a phane can summon
a duplicate of one its foes stolen from a parallel alternate past. The
stolen *time duplicate* has the same stats and possessions as the
original, but is treated as if having two negative levels (which
simulates a less experienced version of the original). The phane can
never summon a past *time duplicate* of a creature with more than 25 HD
(add sufficient negative levels to compensate for high foe HD, if
necessary). The past *time duplicate,*despite having most of the
knowledge of the original, serves the phane loyally like any summoned
creature. If the past *time duplicate* is slain, the original is not
harmed because the duplicate was pulled from a parallel past. However,
the original does not necessarily realize this, and must make a Will
save (DC 30) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds after witnessing the death of a
duplicate for the first time.

**Abomination Traits:** Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other
form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain,
ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true
seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.

**Null Time Field (Ex):** Phanes continually generate a 30-foot-radius
spread null time field. All creatures and objects in the field, except
the phane, must make a Will saving throw (DC 30) each round to take any
actions. On a failed save, subjects are stuck in a static time stream
until their next round of actions, at which time they must make another
saving throw. While a subject is stuck in a static time stream induced
by a null time field, the phane can use its static touch on the subject,
though in all other ways, the subject is invulnerable to attacks and
damage as if in temporal stasis.

**Time Regression (Su):** If the phane spends an action per round for
four rounds, at the end of the 4th round the phane regresses back in
time 4 rounds, to the very 1st round it originally began concentrating
on time regression. On its second pass through the time stream, it can
take completely different actions, based on its knowledge of the future
(though if it takes different actions from its first pass through the
time stream, the events of the original time stream are also changed).

**Regeneration (Ex):** Phanes take normal damage from holy and good
weapons, and from weapons forged in the future or an alternate reality's
time stream (if any).

A xixecal's natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and
chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat

**Rend (Ex):** If the xixecal hits with both claw attacks, it latches
onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically
deals an additional 4d8+42 points of damage.

**Cold (Su):** A hit from a xixecal's melee attack induces numbing cold.
The opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 58) or be affected as
though by a *slow* spell for 10 rounds. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*blasphemy, cone of cold, desecrate,
greater dispel magic, dominate monster, hold person, greater
invisibility, unholy aura, wall of ice;*5/day---*haste, meteor swarm.*
Caster level 36th; save DC 22 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Breath Weapon (Su):** Cone of cold, 300 feet, 3/day, damage 12d6, Fort
half DC 61. The DC is Constitution-based.

***Summon White Dragon* (Sp):** Five times per day a xixecal can summon
an old white dragon.

**Constitution Drain (Su):** This effect permanently reduces a living
opponent's Constitution score by 4 when the creature hits with a slam,
bite, or rend, or twice that amount on a rend or critical hit. The
creature heals 20 points of damage (or 40 on a rend or critical hit)
whenever it drains Constitution, gaining any excess as temporary hit
points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. The attack
allows a Fortitude save (DC 58). The DC is Charisma-based.

**Abomination Traits:** Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other
form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain,
ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
effects; nondetection; true seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.;
telepathy out to 1,000 ft.

The standard fire resistance 20 most abominations have is not shared by
xixecales

**Dire Winter (Su):** A xixecal always stands at the center of a
permanent *dire winter* (epic spell)spell effect. If dispelled, the
effect returns 1 minute later--- the only way to permanently remove the
effect is to slay the xixecal that generates it.

**Regeneration(Ex):** Xixecals take normal damage from Lawful weapons,
and double damage from burning or fiery weapons.

### Behemoth Eagle

**Skills:** \*A behemoth eagle receives a +8 racial bonus on Spot
checks.

**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a behemoth eagle is up to 2,400
pounds; a medium load, 2,401--4,800 pounds; and a heavy load,
4,801--7,200 pounds.

### Behemoth Gorilla

### Combat

**Rend (Ex):** A behemoth gorilla that hits with both claw attacks
latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This automatically
deals an additional 8d8+20 points of damage.

### Combat

**Frightful Howl (Su):** As a standard action, a brachyurus can emit a
howl in a 60-foot-radius spread that affects opponents with fewer Hit
Dice or levels than the brachyurus has. The affected creature must make
a successful Will save (DC 33) or become shaken. Success indicates that
the target is immune to that brachyurus's frightful howl for one day.
The DC is Charisma-based.

**Savage (Ex):** If a brachyurus successfully trips an opponent, it
latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack
automatically deals an additional 15d6+25 points of damage. If an
opponent goes prone for any reason in an area a brachyurus threatens,
the brachyurus can also savage the victim as a free action (treat as the
brachyurus's attack of opportunity for the round), even though it had
nothing to do with tripping the foe.

## Colossus

**Construct Traits:** Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and to poison,
*sleep,* paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic
effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also
works on objects. Cannot heal damage (though regeneration and fast
healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, subdual
damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of
death from massive damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or
less; cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** A colossus completely resists most magical and
supernatural effects, except where otherwise noted below.

**Antimagic Field (Ex):** A colossus constantly generates an antimagic
field in a 100-foot-radius. The field is an invisible barrier that is
impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like
abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the
functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines, except for
the colossus's own supernatural abilities. This effect is otherwise as
an *antimagic* field cast by a 25th-level caster.

A colossus's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Construction

The construction cost given for each colossus takes into account the
physical body and all the materials and spell components that are
consumed or become a permanent part of it. Except for the much tougher
requirements, constructing a colossus is not unlike constructing a
golem.

### Stone Colossus

A stone colossus cannot speak or make any vocal noise.

#### Combat

**Shatter (Su):** A stone colossus can use *shatter*(DC 7)as a free
action once every 2 rounds against an opponent's weapon or other item as
a 24th-level caster. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** A stone colossus is immune to all spells,
spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as follows. A
*transmute rock to mud* spell slows it (as the *slow* spell) for 1
round, with no saving throw, while *transmute mud to rock* heals all its
lost hit points. A *stone to flesh* spell has no effect on a stone
colossus.

#### Construction

A stone colossus's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone,
such as granite, weighing at least 375,000 pounds. The colossus costs
760,000 gp to create, which includes 100,000 gp for the body. Assembling
the body requires a successful Craft (sculpting) or Craft (masonry)
check (DC 37). The creator must be 25th level and able to cast epic
spells. Completing the ritual drains 30,600 XP from the creator and
requires *geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object,* and
*shatter.*

### Flesh Colossus

A flesh colossus knows all languages spoken in life by the ghost who
acts as its control-ling spirit. When the controlling spirit is
suppressed, it mutters in all the tongues spoken by its component
corpses.

#### Combat

**Frightful Presence (Ex):** All who come within a mile of the flesh
colossus must make Will saves (DC 55). Those who make their saves are
shaken. Those who fail by 20 points or less are frightened. Those who
fail by 21 to 40 points are panicked. Those who fail by 41 points or
more are cowering. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Horrific Appearance (Su):** Once per day, the controlling spirit
within a flesh colossus may draw upon the negative energy latent in the
construct to transform its countenance into a horrible leering visage:
All within 300 feet who see this must make a Fortitude save (DC 55) or
take 2d4 points of temporary Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
damage. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Stomp (Ex):** As a full-round action, a flesh colossus may stomp upon
any adjacent foe (that is, any within the area it threatens). Its attack
roll modifier for this special attack is +65 (+75 base, --2 Dex, --8
size). If successful, the stomp deals double damage (8d6 +24) and pins
the victim until the colossus chooses to release him or her.

**Stench (Ex):** All creatures with a sense of smell who come within 300
feet of the construct must make a Fortitude save (DC 60) or be nauseated
(unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything
else requiring attention, except for a single move or move-equivalent
action per round). Those who succeed on their saves take a --4
circumstance penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill
checks for the next 2d6+4 minutes. The DC is Constitution-based.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** A flesh colossus is immune to all magical and
supernatural effects except those that use negative energy (see below).

**Negative Energy Affinity (Su):** Any negative energy spell targeted at
the colossus repairs damage taken by the colossus at the rate of 1d10
hit points per level of the spell.

#### Construction

Only a master necromancer of surpassing power can create a flesh
colossus. The bodies of not less than three hundred previously animated
Medium-size humanoid creatures must be stripped of their flesh and the
bones, which are then rendered in two great vats. The resulting
semiliquid bone-paste is then cast into a new articulated skeleton of
great size, to which the rendered flesh is applied like wet clay to
shape the figure. Finally, the necromancer must bind a ghost of at least
10 HD (the more powerful the better) into the colossus to act as its
controlling spirit. Without the controlling spirit, the colossus is just
an oversized zombie; with it, it functions as a golem of great size and
repugnant appearance. If no ghost is available, the necromancer may
occupy the colossus himself by casting *magic jar*. The colossus costs
760,000 gp to create, which includes 100,000 gp for the body. Assembling
the body takes no great skill, and many flesh colossi reveal that fact
in their uncouth forms. The creator must be 29th level and able to cast
epic spells. Completing the ritual drains 30,600 XP from the creator and
requires *magic jar, limited wish, polymorph any object,* and *finger of
death*.

### Iron Colossus

**Breath Weapon (Su):** Cone of poisonous gas, 80 feet, as a free action
every 1d4 rounds, initial damage 3d6 temporary Con, secondary damage 2d6
temporary Con, Fort half (DC 58). The DC is Constitution-based.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** An iron colossus is immune to all magical and
supernatural effects, except as follows. An electricity effect restores
1 hit point to the iron colossus for each 3 points of damage it would
otherwise deal.

**Rustproof (Ex):** An iron colossus is not affected by rust attacks,
unlike smaller iron golems.

#### Construction

An iron colossus's body is sculpted from 150,000 pounds of pure iron.
The colossus costs 1,000,000 gp to create, which includes 100,500 gp for
the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft
(armorsmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) check (DC 42). The creator
must be 35th level and able to cast epic spells. Completing the ritual
drains 50,000 XP from the creator and requires *cloudkill, geas/quest,
limited wish,* and *polymorph any object.*

Demiliches speak the languages they knew as liches and as living
creatures.

A demilich's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

### Combat

**Trap the Soul (Su):** A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight
living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it
can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fortitude saving throw
(DC 36). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four negative
levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target
fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body
and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich's
form. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within.
The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a
single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich
slowly devours the soul over 24 hours---at the end of that time the soul
is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich
is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the
soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned
to its body by the use of either *resurrection,* *true resurrection,
clone,* or *miracle.* A potential victim protected by a *death ward*
spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its
Fortitude saving throw andis effective against the level loss on a
successful save. The DC is Charisma-based

**Fear Aura (Su):** Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death
and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at
the demilich must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or be affected as
though by *fear* as cast by a 21st-level caster. The DC is
Charisma-based.

**Paralyzing Touch (Su):** Any living creature a demilich touches must
succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 36) or be permanently paralyzed. *Remove
paralysis* or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim. The
effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a demilich seems dead,
though a successful Spot check (DC 20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals
that the victim is still alive.

**Spells:** The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich.
This sample demilich was a 21st-level wizard (spells per day:
4/12/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/6/3). The last three spell slots are 10th-level slots
and available for 0--9th level metamagic spells.

**Perfect Automatic Still Spell (Ex):** A demilich can cast all the
spells it knows without gestures.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*alter self, astral projection,
create greater undead, create undead, death knell, enervation, greater
dispel magic, harm* (usually used to heal itself ), *summon monster
I--IX, telekinesis, weird;* 2/day---*greater planar ally.* Demiliches
use these abilities as casters of a level equal to their spellcaster
level, but the save DCs are all 36. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** Demiliches are immune to all magical and
supernatural effects, except as follows. A *shatter* spell affects a
demilich as if it were a crystalline creature, but deals half the damage
normally indicated. A *dispel evil* spell deals 3d6 points of damage
(Fort save for half damage). *Holy smite* spells affect demiliches
normally.

**Phylactery Transference (Su):** Headbands, belts, rings, cloaks, and
other wearable items kept in close association with the demilich's
phylactery transfer all their benefits to the demilich no matter how far
apart the demilich and the phylactery are located. The standard limits
on types of items utilized simultaneously still apply. The sample
demilich "wears" *bracers of armor +8, headband of intellect +6, pink
Ioun stone, ring of wizardry* I, *ring of protection +2,* and *gloves of
Dexterity +2.*

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning,
disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects,
and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,
ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of
death from massive dam-age, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.
Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature
is willing.

**Immunities (Ex):** Demiliches are immune to cold, electricity,
polymorph, and mind-affecting attacks.

### Creating a Demilich

"Demilich" is a tem-plate that can be added to any lich. It uses all the
lich's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. A
demilich's form is concentrated into a single portion of its original
body, usually its skull. Part of the process of becoming a demilich
includes the incorporation of costly gems into the retained body part;
see Creating Soul Gems, below.

Size: Medium-size and Large liches become Diminutive demiliches, Huge
liches become Small demiliches, Gargantuan liches become Medium-size
demiliches, and Colossal liches become Large demiliches.

**Hit Dice:** As lich.

**Speed:** Replace with fly 180 ft. (perfect) or the lich's supernatural
(not natural) fly speed, whichever is better.

**AC:** The demilich retains the lich's +5 natural armor bonus and gains
an insight bonus equal to AC equal to its Hit Dice, as well as a
probable size adjustment to AC.

**Attack:** The demilich gains an insight bonus equal to its Hit Dice as
a bonus on its touch attacks.

**Damage:** The demilich gains an enhanced touch attack over that of its
previous lich form (it now uses its entire flying skull to make the
touch attack), including paralyzing touch. The demilich's touch attack
uses negative energy to deal 10d6+20 points of damage to living
creatures (no saving throw). Liches with other natural attacks lose
them.

**Special Attacks:** The demilich retains all the lich's special attacks
and also gains those described below.

***Trap the Soul (Su):***A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight
living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it
can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fort saving throw (DC
10 + demilich's HD + demilich's Cha modifier). If the target makes its
saving throw, it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a
use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the
target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the
gems incorporated into the demilich's form. The gem gleams wickedly for
24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body
collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced
to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the
soul over 24 hours---at the end of that time the soul is completely
absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome
before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after
which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body
by the use of either *resurrection,* *true resurrection, clone,* or
*miracle.* If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten,
crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek
the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either
*resurrection,* *true resurrection, clone,* or *miracle.* A potential
victim protected by a *death ward* spell is not immune to trap the soul,
but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude saving throw andis effective
against the level loss on a successful save.

***Fear Aura (Su):*** Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of
death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that
look at the demilich must succeed at a Will save (DC 14 + demilich's Cha
modifier) or be affected as though by *fear* as cast by a 21st-level
caster.

***Paralyzing Touch (Su):*** Any living creature a demilich touches must
succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + demilich's HD + demilich's Cha
modifier) or be permanently paralyzed. *Remove paralysis* or any spell
that can remove a curse can free the victim. The effect cannot be
dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a demilich seems dead, though a
successful Spot check (DC 20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals that the
victim is still alive.

Spells: The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich.

*Perfect Automatic Still Spell:* The demilich can cast all the spells it
knows without gestures.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*alter self, astral projection,
create greater undead, create undead, death knell, enervation, greater
dispel magic, harm* (usually used to heal itself ), *summon monster
I--IX, telekinesis,* and *weird;* 2/day--- *greater planar ally.*
Demiliches use these abilities as casters of a level equal to their
spellcaster level, but the save DCs are equal to 10 + the demilich's
HD + the demilich's Charisma modifier.

**Special Qualities:** The demilich retains all the lich's special
qualities and also has those described below.

***Magic Immunity (Ex):***Demiliches are immune to all magical and
supernatural effects, except as follows. A *shatter* spell affects a
demilich as if it were a crystalline creature, but deals half the damage
normally indicated. A *dispel evil* spell deals 3d6 points of damage
(Fort save for half damage). *Holy smite* spells affect demiliches
normally.

***Phylactery Transference (Su):***Headbands, belts, rings, cloaks, and
other wearable items kept in close association with the demilich's
phylactery transfer all their benefits to the demilich no matter how far
apart the demilich and the phylactery are located. The standard limits
on types of items utilized simultaneously still apply.

***Undead Traits:***Immune to poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning,
disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects,
and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,
ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of
death from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.
Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature
is willing.

***Immunities (Ex):***Demiliches are immune to cold, electricity,
polymorph, and mind-affecting attacks.

***Turn Resistance (Ex):*** A demilich has turn resistance +20.

***Damage Reduction (Su):***A demilich loses any previous damage
reduction and instead has damage reduction 15/Epic and bludgeoning (15
points of damage is subtracted from all melee attacks unless the weapon
used is both an epic and a bludgeoning weapon). Vorpal weapons, no
matter their enhancement bonus, ignore this damage reduction but do only
half damage to a demilich (demiliches cannot be beheaded).

***Resistances (Ex):***Demiliches have acid resistance 20, fire
resistance 20, and sonic resistance 20.

**Saves:** Same as the lich.

**Abilities:** A demilich gains +10 to Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma.

**Skills:** Demiliches receive a +20 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the
lich (this overlaps with the previous racial bonus gained by the lich;
it does not stack).

**Feats:** Same as the lich.

**Epic Feats:** Demiliches gain the feats Blinding Speed, Tenacious
Magic, and Automatic Quicken Spell.

**Climate/Terrain:** Same as the lich.

**Organization:** Solitary or consistory (1 demilich and 3--6 liches).

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the lich + 6.

**Treasure:** Same as the lich.

**Alignment:** Any evil.

**Advancement:** By character class.

### Demilich Characters

The process of becoming a demilich can be undertaken only by a lich
acting of its own free will. The demilich retains all class abilities it
had as a lich.

### Creating Soul Gems

Liches have phylacteries that allow them to reappear 1d10 days after
their apparent death, as do demiliches. Demiliches also have eight soul
gems, each of which acts like a phylactery in its own right. If all the
soul gems, as well as the demilich's phylactery, are not destroyed after
a demilich is downed, the demilich reappears 1d10 days after its
apparent death. The soul gems also allow the demilich to use its most
devastating ability, trap the soul (see above). Each demilich must make
its own soul gems, which requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The lich
must be a sorcerer, wizard, or cleric of at least 21st level. Each soul
gem costs 120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to create and has a caster level equal
to that of its creator at the time of creation. Soul gems appear as
egg-shaped gems of wondrous quality. They are always incorporated
directly into the concentrated form of the demilich.

## Devastation Vermin

**Vermin Traits:** Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

### Devastation Centipede

**Poison (Ex):** Bite, Fort save (DC 93); initial and secondary damage
2d12 temporary Dex.

**Skills:** Devastation centipedes receive a +8 racial bonus on Climb,
Hide, and Spot checks.

### Devastation Spider

**Poison (Ex):** Bite, Fort save (DC 94); initial and secondary damage
2d12 temporary Con.

**Web (Ex):** A single web strand is strong enough to support the spider
and one creature of Gargantuan size. Web-spinning devastation spiders
can cast a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a
net but has a maximum range of 150 feet, with a range increment of 30
feet, and is effective against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web
anchors the target in place, allowing no movement. An entangled creature
can escape with a successful Escape Artist check (DC 38) or burst it
with a Strength check (DC 44). Both are standard actions. Web-spinning
spiders often create sheets of sticky webbing about 1,000 feet square.
They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can
also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed
at a Spot check (DC 20) to notice a web; otherwise, they stumble into it
and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to
escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has
something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has
24 hit points, and sheet webs have damage reduction 20/fire. A
devastation spider can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed
and can determine the exact location of any creature caught in the web.

**Skills:** Web-spinning devastation spiders receive a +4 racial bonus
on Hide and Spot checks. Hunting spiders receive a +6 racial bonus on
Jump checks and a +8 racial bonus on Spot checks (using the modifiers
given in parentheses). \*All devastation spiders gain a +8 competence
bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks when using their webs.

### Devastation Scorpion

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, the devastation scorpion
must hit with its claw attack. If it gets a hold, it hangs on and
squeezes.

**Squeeze (Ex):** A devastation scorpion that gets a hold on a
Gargantuan or smaller opponent automatically deals damage with both
claws and its sting.

**Poison (Ex):** Sting, Fort save (DC 95); initial and secondary damage
2d12 temporary Str.

**Skills:** Devastation scorpions receive a +4 racial bonus on Climb,
Hide, and Spot checks.

### Devastation Beetle

**Trample (Ex):** A devastation beetle can trample Gargantuan and
smaller creatures for 30d10+24 points of damage. Opponents who do not
make attacks of opportunity against the devastation beetle can attempt a
Reflex save (DC 90) to halve the damage.

**Acid Cloud (Ex):** A devastation beetle exudes a constant vapor that
radiates outward in every direction for 60 feet. This vapor deals 6d6
points of acid damage each round to anyone caught in the cloud.

## Dragon, Advanced

The standard advancement rules allow dragons theoretically infinite
progression even beyond the stage of great wyrm. The following rules let
dragons improve more than their Hit Dice as they progress to epic
heights of power.

**Age Category:** A standard dragon gains one "virtual age category" for
every 3 Hit Dice it gains beyond the great wyrm stage. Abilities that
function once per day per age category or otherwise use the dragon's age
category as part of a calculation use this adjusted number. Epic dragons
gain one age category per 5 Hit Dice beyond great wyrm.

**Size:** One important element of dragon advancement is increasing
size. The dragons that don't reach Colossal size by the great wyrm stage
can never reach it according to the standard advancement rules. When
advancing a dragon, consider its basic size group: lesser (white, black,
brass, and copper dragons), ordinary (green, blue, and bronze dragons),
greater (silver, red, and gold), or epic (force and prismatic). A dragon
that is Tiny as a wyrmling is in the lesser group, a dragon that is
Small as a wyrmling and never reaches Colossal size is in the ordinary
group, and a dragon that is Small to Large as a wyrmling and reaches
Colossal by the great wyrm stage is in the greater group. A lesser
dragon becomes Colossal when it gains two age categories (6 Hit Dice)
beyond great wyrm. It increases to Colossal+ when it gains an additional
four age categories (12 HD). An ordinary dragon becomes Colossal when it
gains one age category (3 Hit Dice) beyond great wyrm. It increases to
Colossal+ when it gains an additional four age categories (12 HD). A
greater dragon becomes Colossal+ when it gains four age categories (12
HD) more than it needed to reach the Colossal size.

Epic dragons, already Colossal+ by the time they reach the great wyrm
stage, do not increase in size thereafter. Use the information presented
under the epic dragon entry, below, to determine the statistics of a
Colossal+ dragon.

**Armor Class:** A dragon's natural armor bonus increases by +1 for
every Hit Die it gains beyond the great wyrm stage. (This rule applies
for lesser dragon advancement as well, since natural armor and Hit Dice
always increase at the same rate.)

**Breath Weapon:** If a dragon's breath weapon deals damage, the damage
typically increases by 2 dice for every virtual age category the dragon
gains. The two exceptions among standard dragonsare the brass and white
dragons, whose breath weapon damage increases by only 1 die per age
category. The saving throw DC against a dragon's breath weapon remains
10 + 1/2 the dragon's Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier.

**Spell Resistance:** For standard advanced dragons, spell resistance
increases by 2 per additional age category. For epic dragons, spell
resistance increases by 3 (for force dragons) or 6 (for prismatic
dragons) per additional age category.

**Speed:** When a dragon becomes Colossal, its fly speed increases by 50
feet and its maneuverability becomes clumsy. When it reaches Colossal+,
its fly speed increases by another 50 feet, and its maneuverability
remains clumsy. A dragon's land speed and other special movement types
(swim, burrow, and so on) do not change.

**Ability Scores:** A great wyrm's Strength and Constitution scores both
increase by +2 for every virtual age category the dragon gains. Its
Dexterity remains unchanged. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
increase by +2 for every two age categories the dragon gains.

**Special Abilities:** Dragons do not gain additional spell-like
abilities, but their damage reduction continues to increase as they gain
Hit Dice. For most dragons (the exceptions being the force and prismatic
dragons), the great wyrm's damage reduction increases to 15/epic after
exceeding the great wyrm age category and the dragon's natural weapons
count as epic weapons for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.

Force and prismatic dragons have the following DR progression: wyrmling
10/magic, young 15/magic, young adult 15/epic, mature adult 20/epic,
very old 25/epic.

*Caster Level:* A great wyrm's caster level increases by 2 for every
virtual age category the dragon gains. As with the epic dragons
described later, advanced dragons gain the Improved Spell Capacity feat
as a bonus feat once for every three caster levels above 20th.

**Feats:** Like ordinary dragons, advanced dragons receive one feat for
every 3 Hit Dice they have. Feats gained after the dragon attains great
wyrm status can be epic feats.

**Challenge Rating:** For standard dragons, CR increases by 2 per
additional age category. For epic dragons, CR increases by 3 per
additional age category. All other dragon statistics are as presented
for dragons in general and specific dragon varieties.

## Dragon,Epic

All epic dragons speak Draconic.

### Combat

Epic dragons share all the combat characteristics of standard dragons.
Even wyrmling epic dragons are Huge, however, and are capable of making
tail sweep and crush attacks. Although there is no size category larger
than Colossal, the oldest epic dragons deal more damage with their
attacks than other Colossal dragons, as shown on the Epic Dragon Face
and Reach and Epic Dragon Attacks tables below. In addition, the breath
weapon of the oldest epic dragons is a larger cone than most Colossal
dragons possess. The size modifier for these dragons remains --8.

  ---------------------------------------------- -----------------

Wyrmling epic dragons possess certain abilities that common dragons do
not acquire until later in life, including frightful presence,
spellcasting, and spell resistance. An epic dragon with a caster level
above 20th gains the Improved Spell Capacity feat as a bonus feat once
for every three caster levels above 20th. Any epic dragon can choose
epic feats for which it otherwise meets the prerequisites. Epic dragons
also have access to dragon feats, as well as the additional feats
described in this book.

**Empower Spell-Like Ability:** An epic dragon can apply the Empower
Spell feat to one of its spell-like abilities that it can use at least
twice per day. If the dragon has limited use of the spell-like ability,
the empowered ability uses up two uses of the ability. If the dragon can
use the ability at will, there is no cost for empowering the ability.
The dragon does not need to specify a spell-like ability when it chooses
this feat; it can apply the feat to any spell-like ability it possesses.

**Maximize Spell-Like Ability:** The dragon can apply the Maximize Spell
feat to one of its spell-like abilities that it can use at least three
times per day. If the dragon has limited use of the spell-like ability,
the maximized ability uses up three uses of the ability. If the dragon
can use the ability at will, there is no cost for maximizing the
ability. The dragon does not need to specify a spell-like ability when
it chooses this feat; it can apply the feat to any spell-like ability it
possesses.

Epic dragons fly even faster than common dragons, and can cover greater
distances.

A force dragon's natural weapons are treated as magic (wyrmling --
juvenile) or epic (young adult -- great wyrm) for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

#### Combat

**Breath Weapon (Su):** A force dragon has one type of breath weapon, a
cone of force that tears through creatures and objects in its area to
devastating effect.

**Immune to Force (Ex):** A force dragon cannot be harmed by any force
effect, including *magic missiles, explosive runes, mage's sword,* the
*sphere* spells, or any other spell or effect with the Force descriptor.
It can move freely through barriers made of force, such as a *wall of
force.*

**Deflecting Force (Su):** A force dragon is protected by a shield of
force that provides a deflection bonus to its AC. The deflection bonus
is equal to the dragon's Charisma bonus.

**Blur (Su):** When a force dragon reaches juvenile age, the force
surrounding its body distorts the light around it so that it is hard to
discern the dragon's exact location. This functions as a continuous
*blur* spell, giving the dragon concealment (20% miss chance).

**Displacement (Su):** An old force dragon's deflecting force bends
light even more ex-tremely, giving the dragon the benefit of the
*displacement* spell (50% miss chance). This supersedes its *blur*
ability.

**Invisibility (Su):** A great wyrm force dragon is a creature of pure
force, and is completely invisible (as though protected by *greater
invisibility).*A creature that can see invisible creatures must still
contend with the dragon's *displacement* ability.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day---*forcecage, maze, resilient sphere,
telekinetic sphere, wall of force.*The DCs are Charisma-based.

  -------------- ------------------------------ ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------- ----

A prismatic dragon's natural weapons are treated as magic (wyrmling --
juvenile) or epic (young adult -- great wyrm) for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

#### Combat

**Breath Weapon (Su):** A prismatic dragon has one type of breath
weapon, a *prismatic spray* effect. The breath weapon's cone is of the
size indicated by the dragon's size, not the normal cone for the spell.

**Deflecting Force (Su):** A prismatic dragon is protected by a shield
of shimmering light similar to a *cloak of chaos* that provides a
deflection bonus to its AC. The deflection bonus is equal to the
dragon's Charisma bonus.

**Immune to Light and Blindness (Ex):** Prismatic dragons cannot be
harmed by any light, including Evocation \[Light\] spells, *searing
light,* and the various *prismatic (sphere, spray, wall*) spells. In
addition, they are immune to any spell or effect that causes blindness.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will---*hypnotic pattern, rainbow pattern;*
3/day---*prismatic sphere, prismatic wall, sunbeam, sunburst.* The DC is
Charisma-based.

### Primal Air Elemental

Primal air elementals speak Auran.

#### Combat

**Air Mastery (Ex):** Airborne creatures take a --1 penalty on attack
and damage rolls against an air elemental.

**Whirlwind (Su):** The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind
once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 1 round for
every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can move through the air
or along a surface at its fly speed. A primal air whirlwind is 10 feet
wide at the base, 40 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The
elemental controls its exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.
Gargantuan or smaller creatures might take damage when caught in the
whirlwind and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must
succeed at a Reflex save (DC 53) when it comes into contact with the
whirlwind or take 4d8 points of damage. It must also succeed at a second
Reflex save (DC 53) or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the
powerful winds, automatically taking 4d8 points of damage each round. A
creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save (DC 53) each round to
escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if
the save is successful. The elemental can eject any carried creatures
whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to
be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before
returning to its home plane. If the whirlwind's base touches the ground,
it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the
elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The
cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.
Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those farther
away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed at a
Concentration check (DC 53) to cast a spell. The DC is Strength-based.

### Primal Earth Elemental

Earth elementals speak Terran.

#### Combat

**Earth Mastery (Ex):** An earth elemental gains a +1 attack and damage
bonus if both it and its foe touch the ground. If an opponent is
airborne or water-borne, the elemental takes a --4 penalty on attack and
damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics
block.)

**Push (Ex):** An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver without
provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given for earth
mastery, above, also apply to the elemental's opposed Strength checks.

### Primal Fire Elemental

A primal fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable
liquid. Unlike lesser fire elementals, a primal fire elemental may
attempt to evaporate a lesser body of water if blocked. Fire elementals
speak Ignan.

#### Combat

**Burn (Ex):** Those hit by a primal fire elemental's slam attack must
succeed at a Reflex save (DC 51) or catch fire. The flame burns for 1d4
rounds. A burning creature can take a move-equivalent action to put out
the flame. Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or
unarmed attacks take fire damage as though hit by the elemental's
attack, and also catch fire unless they succeed at a Reflex save. The DC
is Constitution-based.

### Primal Water Elemental

A primal water elemental can't venture more than 360 feet from the body
of water from which it emerged. Water elementals speak Aquan.

#### Combat

**Water Mastery (Ex):** A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and
damage rolls if both it and its opponent touch water. If the opponent or
elemental is land-bound, the elemental takes a --4 penalty on attack and
damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics
block.) A primal water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that
crosses its path. It can easily overturn even large craft (ships of up
to 5 feet in length per Hit Dice of the elemental) and stop massive
vessels (ships of less than 10 feet in length per HD). Even ocean-going
behemoths (ships of less than 20 feet in length per HD) can be slowed to
half speed.

**Drench (Ex):** The elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires,
exposed lanterns, and other open flames of non-magical origin if these
are Gargantuan or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it
touches as *dispel magic* cast by a caster whose level equals the
elemental's HD total (64).

**Vortex (Su):** The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool
once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and remain in that
form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has (48 rounds). In vortex
form, the elemental can move through the water or along the bottom at
its swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet
wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The elemental controls its
exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. Gargantuan and smaller
creatures might take damage when caught in the vortex and may be swept
up by it. An affected creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 58)
when it comes into contact with the vortex or take 4d10 points of
damage. It must also succeed at a second Reflex save (DC 68) or be
picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents,
automatically taking 4d10 points of damage each round. A creature that
can swim is allowed a Reflex save (DC 58) each round to escape the
vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave if the save is
successful. The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it
wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex hap-pens to be. A summoned
elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home
plane. If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling
cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a
diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The cloud obscures all
vision, including dark-vision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have
one-half concealment, while those farther away have total concealment.
Those caught in the cloud must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 58)
to cast a spell. The DC is Strength-based.
