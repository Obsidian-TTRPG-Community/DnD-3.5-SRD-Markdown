# EPIC SKILLS

Despite the near-magical nature of some epic level skill uses, all uses
of skills are considered exceptional abilities (except if noted
otherwise), and thus function normally even within areas of antimagic.

## Skill Synergy

Many skills are noted as granting a synergy bonus to the use of another
skill when a character has 5 or more ranks in the first skill. This
synergy bonus increases by +2 for every additional 20 ranks the
character has in the skill.

## Skill Descriptions

This section describes new DCs and new modifiers for skills.

## Appraise

The character can sense magical auras in objects.

  -------------- ----
  Task           DC
  Detect magic   50
  -------------- ----

**Detect Magic:**The character can sense if an item has a magical aura.
He or she can then use Spellcraft to learn more about the item as if he
or she had already cast *detect magic* on the item. This requires a
full-round action.

## Balance

  ------------------- -----
  Surface             DC
  1--2 inches wide    20
  Up to 1 inch wide   40
  Hair-thin           60
  Liquid\*            90
  Cloud               120
  ------------------- -----

\*Includes any other surface that couldn't support the character's
weight, such as a fragile branch.

## Bluff

The character can implant a nonmagical suggestion in a target, display a
false alignment, or disguise his or her surface thoughts.

  ------------------------------ -----------------------
  Example Circumstance           Sense Motive Modifier
  Instill suggestion in target   +50
  Task                           DC
  Display false alignment        70
  Disguise surface thoughts      100
  ------------------------------ -----------------------

**Instill Suggestion in Target:**This is identical to the effect of the
*suggestion* spell, except that it is nonmagical and lasts for only 10
minutes. It can be sensed as if it were an enchantment effect (Sense
Motive DC 25).

**Display False Alignment:**The character can fool alignment-sensing
effects by displaying a false alignment of his or her choice. Once set,
a false alignment remains as long as the character remains conscious and
awake. Setting or changing a false alignment requires a full-round
action.

**Disguise Surface Thoughts:**The character can fool spells such as
*detect thoughts* (or similar effects) by displaying false surface
thoughts. While the character can't completely mask the presence of his
or her thoughts, he or she can change his or her apparent Intelligence
score (and thus the character's apparent mental strength) by as much as
10 points and can place any thought in his or her "surface thoughts" to
be read by such spells or effects. If a character attempts to use Sense
Motive to detect his or her surface thoughts (see the Sense Motive skill
description), this becomes an opposed check (though any result lower
than 100 automatically fails).

## Climb

The character can climb otherwise unclimbable surfaces.

  ----- -----------------------------------------------
  DC    Surface
  70    A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface
  100   A perfectly smooth, flat, overhang or ceiling
  ----- -----------------------------------------------

**Rapid Climbing:**A character can climb his or her speed as a
move-equivalent action, or double his or her speed as a full-round
action (requiring two Climb checks), but the character takes a --20
penalty on his or her check.

Special: The Legendary Climber feat allows a character to ignore any
penalties for accelerated or rapid climbing.

## Concentration

The character can cast spells with somatic components even while
grappled.

  -------------------------------------------------- ------------------
  Task                                               DC
  Cast spell with somatic component while grappled   50 + spell level
  -------------------------------------------------- ------------------

## Craft

The character can craft items more quickly than normal.

  ---------------- -------------------
  Task             DC
  Quick creation   +10 or more to DC
  ---------------- -------------------

### Quick Creation
A character can voluntarily increase the DC of
crafting an item by any multiple of 10. This allows the character to
create an item more quickly (since he or she will be multiplying this
higher DC by his or her skill check result to determine progress). The
character must decide the increase to the DC before making the check.

## Craft (Alchemy)

  ---------------------------- ---------------------
  Task                         DC (or DC Modifier)
  Create augmented substance   +20 or more to DC
  ---------------------------- ---------------------

**Create Augmented Alchemical Item or Substance:**This requires the
Augmented Alchemy feat, and allows a character to create alchemical
items and substances of greater power than normal. To augment an
alchemical substance, add +20 to the DC required to create the item and
multiply the cost by 5. If the item or substance deals damage, double
the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn't deal damage, double
the duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn't deal damage
and doesn't have a specific listed duration (or has an instantaneous
duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance
doesn't fit any of these categories, then it cannot be improved in this
manner. A character can create an item with multiple degrees of
augmentation. For every additional multiplier applied to damage,
duration, or area, add an additional +20 to the DC and add an additional
5 to the cost multiplier.

  ------------------ ----------------------------------------------
  Item               Effect of Augmenting
  Acid               Direct hit 2d6, splash 2
  Alchemist's fire   Direct hit 2d6, splash 2
  Antitoxin          Duration 2 hours
  Smokestick         Smoke fills a 20-foot cube
  Sunrod             Glows for 12 hours
  Tanglefoot bag     Becomes brittle and fragile after 20 minutes
  Tindertwig         No effect
  ------------------ ----------------------------------------------

## Decipher Script

The character can decipher magic scrolls.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------
  Task                                                                                      DC
  Decipher a written spell (such as a scroll) without using *read magic.*One try per day.   50 + 5 times spell level
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------

## Diplomacy

The character can turn a person into a fanatic follower. Refer to the
accompanying table.

  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- ------------- ------------- ------ ---------

### Hos:** hostile. **Unf:** unfriendly. **Indif
indifferent.
### Friend:** friendly. **Help
helpful.

### Fanatic
The attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the
obvious effects, any NPC whose attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale
bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will
saves, and a --1 penalty to AC whenever fighting for the character or
his or her cause. This attitude will remain for one day plus one day per
point of the character's Charisma bonus, at which point the NPC's
attitude will revert to its original attitude (or indifferent, if no
attitude is specified).

Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for
purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or being detected by the Sense
Motive skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can't be dispelled; however,
any effect that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will
affect it normally. A fanatic NPC's attitude can't be further adjusted
by the use of skills.

  ---------- ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attitude   Means                         Possible Actions

  ---------- ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Disable Device

The character can rush his or her Disable Device attempt, reducing the
amount of time it takes to perform the attempt.

  ------------------------ -------------
  Reduce to                DC Modifier
  1 round                  +20
  Move-equivalent action   +50
  Free action              +100
  ------------------------ -------------

## Disguise

The character can change his or her apparent height and weight much more
than normal.

  ---------------------------------------- ----------
  Disguise                                 Modifier
  Change height and/or weight 11% to 25%   --25\*
  Change height and/or weight 26% to 50%   --50\*
  ---------------------------------------- ----------

\*Can be negated by any effect that can duplicate a height and/or weight
change of this degree.

## Escape Artist

The character can pass through spaces smaller than his or her head, or
even through a *wall of force.*

  ----- ------------------------------
  DC    Task
  80    Extremely tight space
  120   Pass through *wall of force*
  ----- ------------------------------

**Extremely Tight Space:**This is the DC for getting through a space
when one's head shouldn't even be able to fit; this can be as small as 2
inches square for Medium-size creatures. Halve this limit for each size
category less than Medium-size; double it for each size category greater
than Medium-size. If the space is long, such as in a chimney, multiple
checks may be called for.

### Pass through *Wall of Force*
This allows a character to find a gap
of weakness in a *wall of force* (or similar force effect) and squeeze
through it.

## Forgery

The character can forge handwriting he or she haven't even seen.

  ------------------------------- -------------------------
  Condition                       Reader's Check Modifier
  Forge document without sample   +50
  ------------------------------- -------------------------

### Forge Document without Sample
The character can forge a document
without having seen a similar document or having a sample of the
handwriting to be copied.

## Gather Information

The character can gather information without eliciting suspicion.

  ----------------- ----------------
  Task              Check Modifier
  Avoid suspicion   --20
  ----------------- ----------------

**Avoid Suspicion:**By accepting a --20 penalty on his or her Gather
Information check, a character can avoid any suspicions that might
otherwise be aroused by someone pursuing sensitive information.

## Handle Animal

The character can handle creatures other than animals, and can teach or
train in much less time than normally required.

  ---------------------- ---------- --------------------------
  Task                   Time       DC
  Rear magical beast     1 year     30 + HD of magical beast
  Train magical beast    2 months   40 + HD of magical beast
  Rear vermin            6 months   35 + HD of vermin
  Train vermin           2 months   50 + HD of vermin
  Rear other creature    Varies     40 + HD of creature
  Train other creature   2 months   60 + HD of creature
  ---------------------- ---------- --------------------------

  ----------------------------------- -------------
  Reduce Teaching/Training to . . .   DC Modifier
  1 month                             +25
  1 day                               +50
  1 hour                              +75
  1 minute                            +100
  ----------------------------------- -------------

### Reduce Teaching/Training
Normally, teaching or training a creature
requires two months of time. A character can accelerate the process of
teaching or training a creature, reducing the time required to the
listed time, by adding the DC modifier to the base DC for teaching or
training the creature. A character can't reduce the required time to
less than 1 minute.

## Heal

The character can greatly speed a patient's recovery of hit points.

  ------------------ -----
  Task               DC
  Quicken recovery   50
  Perfect recovery   100
  ------------------ -----

### Quicken Recovery
The character can allow a character to regain hit
points in a single hour as if he or she had provided long-term care for
a full day (2 or 3 hit points per level, based on activity). The
character can quicken the recovery of up to six patients at a time. No
character's recovery can be quickened more than once per day (even by
different healers).

**Perfect Recovery:**The character can allow a character to regain hit
points in a single hour as if he or she had provided long-term care for
a full week (2 or 3 hit points per level per day, based on activity).
The character can use perfect recovery on up to six patients at a time.
No character's recovery can be perfected more than once per day, nor can
perfect recovery and quicken recovery both be used on the same patient
in the same day (even by different healers).

## Hide

The character can hide others as well as hiding him or herself.

  -------------- ----------------
  Task           Check Modifier
  Hide another   --30
  -------------- ----------------

***Hide Another:***By accepting a --30 penalty on his or her Hide check,
a character can hide another adjacent creature whose size is no more
than one category larger than the character's own. Modifiers to the
check for the size of the creature still apply, as do all other
penalties, including those for moving faster than half speed. Likewise,
a character can only hide another creature when it is not under direct
observation by a third party. The creature the character hides remains
hidden until it is spotted or it takes some other action that breaks its
concealment, as normal.

## Intimidate

Intimidate does not possess an epic usage.

### Special
The DC to intimidate any creature whose attitude is fanatic
is increased by +20.

## Jump

Jump does not possess an epic usage.

## Knowledge

Knowledge does not possess an epic usage.

## Listen

The character can pinpoint the location of an invisible creature, or
detect an illusion with an auditory component.

  ---- -----------------------------------------
  DC   Task
  80   Defeat illusion with auditory component
  ---- -----------------------------------------

**Defeat Illusion:**The character can automatically detect any illusion
with an auditory component for what it truly is. No Will save is
required, and the character doesn't have to interact with the illusion
(but he or she must be able to hear its auditory component). Special: A
character can use Listen to notice the presence of an invisible creature
(generally opposed by a Move Silently check). If the character beats the
DC by 20 or more, he or she can pinpoint the location of the invisible
creature, though it still maintains total concealment from the character
(50% miss chance).

## Move Silently

Move Silently does not possess an epic usage.

## Open Lock

The character can open locks more quickly than normal.

  ------------------------ -------------
  Open lock as . . .       DC Modifier
  Move-equivalent action   +20
  Free action              +50
  ------------------------ -------------

## Perform

The character can sway an audience's attitude with his or her
performance.

  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- ------------- ------------- ------ ---------
                                                                                    []{style="

  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- ------------- ------------- ------ ---------

### Hos:** hostile. **Unf:** unfriendly. **Indif
indifferent.
### Friend:** friendly. **Help
helpful.

### Fanatic
The attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the
obvious effects, any NPC whose attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale
bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will
saves, and a --1 penalty to AC whenever fighting for the character or
his or her cause. This attitude will remain for one day plus one day per
point of the character's Charisma bonus, at which point the NPC's
attitude will revert to its original attitude (or indifferent, if no
attitude is specified).

Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for
purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or being detected by the Sense
Motive skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can't be dispelled; however,
any effect that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will
affect it normally. A fanatic NPC's attitude can't be further adjusted
by the use of skills.

  ---------- ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attitude   Means                         Possible Actions
  Fanatic    Will give life to serve you   Fight to the death against overwhelming odds, throw self in front of onrushing dragon
  ---------- ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Profession

Profession does not possess an epic usage.

## Ride

The character can stand upon his or her mount in combat.

  ---- ---------------------
  DC   Task
  40   Stand on mount
  50   Unconscious control
  60   Attack from cover
  ---- ---------------------

### Stand on Mount
This allows the character to stand on his or her
mount's back even during movement or combat. The character takes no
penalties to actions while doing so.

### Unconscious Control
As a free action, the character can attempt to
control a light horse, pony, or heavy horse while in combat. If the
character fails, he or she controls the mount as a move-equivalent
action. A character does not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.

### Attack from Cover
The character can react instantly to drop down
and hang alongside his or her mount, using it as one-half cover. The
character can attack and cast spells while using his or her mount as
cover without penalty. If the character fails, he or she doesn't get the
cover benefit.

## Search

The character can sense the presence of magic in an area.

  ------------- ----
  Task          DC
  Sense magic   60
  ------------- ----

### Sense Magic
The character senses the presence of any active magical
effects in the area being searched. The character can't determine the
number, strength, or type of the effects.

## Sense Motive

The character can discern a target's alignment and even detect surface
thoughts.

  --------------------------- -----
  Task                        DC
  Discern partial alignment   60
  Discern full alignment      80
  Detect surface thoughts     100
  --------------------------- -----

### Discern Partial Alignment
This use of the skill lets a character
discern one component of a target's alignment. When making the check,
the character states whether he or she is trying to discern the
law--chaos or good--evil component. A character can't retry the check,
and he or she can't use this to discern more than one component of the
alignment (but see below). The target must be visible and within 30 feet
of the character.

### Discern Full Alignment
This use of the skill lets a character
determine both components of a target's alignment. The character can't
retry the check. The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the
character.

### Detect Surface Thoughts
This lets a character read the surface
thoughts of a single target (as the 3rd-round effect of the *detect
thoughts* spell). There is no saving throw to resist this effect, though
the target can use Bluff to disguise his or her surface thoughts (see
the Bluff skill description), in which case this becomes an opposed
check (any result lower than 100 automatically fails). The target must
be visible and within 30 feet of the character.

## Sleight of Hand

The character can lift another's weapon and perform major feats of
legerdemain.

  ---- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DC   Task
  50   Lift a sheathed weapon from another creature and hide it on the character's person, if the weapon is no more than one size category larger than the character's own size.
  80   Make an adjacent, willing creature or object of the character's size or smaller "disappear" while in plain view. In fact, the willing creature or object is displaced up to 10 feet away---make a separate Hide check to determine how well the "disappeared" creature or object is hidden.
  ---- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Spellcraft

The character can identify properties of a magic item.

  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  DC                  Task
  50 + caster level   Identify basic property of magic item
  70 + caster level   Identify all properties of magic item
  50                  Quick identification of alchemical substances and potions
  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------

### Identify Basic Property of Magic Item
This use of the skill
requires one round of inspection, and functions exactly as if the
character had cast an *identify* spell on the item. A character can't
attempt this on the same item more than once.

**Identify All Properties of Magic Item:**This requires one minute of
inspection, and reveals all properties of a single magic item (including
command words and charges remaining). A character can't attempt this on
the same item more than once. If an item has different caster levels for
different properties, use the highest caster level.

### Quick Identification
A character can identify a substance or potion
in the field as a full-round action, without an alchemical lab or any
cost. The character can't retry this check (or take 20); if he or she
fails, the character must identify the substance in an alchemical lab,
as normal.

## Spot

The character can pinpoint the location of an invisible creature, or
detect an illusion with a visual component.

  ---- ----------------------------------------------------------
  DC   Task
  20   Notice presence of active invisible creature
  30   Notice presence of unmoving, living invisible creature
  40   Notice presence of inanimate invisible object
  40   Notice presence of unmoving, unliving invisible creature
  80   Defeat illusion
  ---- ----------------------------------------------------------

A character can use Spot to notice the presence of an invisible
creature. The relevant DCs are reprinted here. If the character beats
the DC by 20 or more, he or she can pinpoint the location of the
invisible creature, though it still maintains total concealment from the
character (50% miss chance).

### Defeat Illusion
The character can automatically detect any illusion
with a visual component for what it truly is. No Will save is required,
and the character doesn't have to interact with the illusion (but he or
she must be able to see it).

**Using Spot to Read Lips:**

  -------------------------------------------- -------------
  Task                                         DC Modifier
  Read lips while moving at up to full speed   +20
  Pronounce unfamiliar language                +20
  -------------------------------------------- -------------

**Pronounce Unfamiliar Language:**This use of the skill allows a
character to repeat the speech of an observed creature, potentially
allowing a comrade to translate the speech. It doesn't grant the
character any ability to understand the language spoken.

## Survival

The character can ignore the effects of terrain on movement and
withstand even the harshest weather. If the character is capable of
tracking, he or she can identify the races of creatures being tracked.

  ---- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DC   Task
  40   Get along in the wild while moving at full speed. The character can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which the check result exceeds 40.
  60   Automatically succeed on all Fortitude saves against severe weather. The character can extend this benefit to one other character for every 2 points by which the check result exceeds 60.
  60   Ignore overland movement penalties of terrain. The character and his or her mount can move at full overland speed regardless of terrain. The character can extend this benefit to one other character for every 5 points by which the check result exceeds 60.
  60   Identify race/kind of creature(s) by tracks.\*
  ---- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*Requires the Track feat.

Wherever the character is, he or she can determine the direction to a
location on the same plane.

  ----- ---------------------------
  DC    Familiarity with Location
  40    Very familiar
  60    Studied carefully
  80    Seen casually
  100   Viewed once
  120   Description only
  ----- ---------------------------

With a successful check, the character knows the direction to the
desired location. This merely points the character in the direction of
the location; it doesn't provide him or her with information on how to
get there, nor does it take into account any obstacles in the path.
"Very familiar" represents a place where the character has been very
often and where he or she feels at home. "Studied carefully" represents
a place the character knows well, either because he or she has been
there often or has used other means to study the place. "Seen casually"
is a place that the character has viewed more than once, but which he or
she has not studied. "Viewed once" is a place that the character has
seen once, possibly using magic. "Description only" is a place whose
location and appearance the character knows through someone else's
description.

## Swim

The character can swim up vertical surfaces, or swim much faster than
normal.

  ---- -------------------
  DC   Task
  80   Swim up waterfall
  ---- -------------------

### Swim up Waterfall
This use of the skill allows a character to swim
an angled or vertical surface, as long as he or she remains completely
or mostly immersed in water. Other examples might include swimming up a
whirlpool or an incredibly large wave.

  ---------------- -------------
  Circumstance     DC Modifier
  Speed swimming   --20
  ---------------- -------------

### Speed Swimming
By taking a --20 penalty on the check, a character
can swim his or her speed as a move-equivalent action, or double his or
her speed as a full-round action.

## Tumble

The character can fall from great heights without taking damage, move
greater distances with an adjustment, or "climb" vertical surfaces with
a series of bounces.

  ----- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  DC    Task
  30    Treat a fall as if it were 20 feet shorter when determining damage.
  35    Free stand.
  45    Treat a fall as if it were 30 feet shorter when determining damage.
  50    Climb vertical surface.
  60    Treat a fall as if it were 40 feet shorter when determining damage.
  100   Ignore falling damage.
  ----- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Free Stand
The character can stand up from prone as a free action
(instead of as a move-equivalent action).

### Climb Vertical Surface
The character can climb up to 20 feet (as
part of normal move-ment) by jumping and bouncing off walls, trees, or
similar vertical surfaces. The character must have at least two vertical
surfaces to bounce off, and the two must be within 10 feet of each
other.

### Ignore Falling Damage
The character can fall from any height and
take no damage.

Special: A character with 25 or more ranks in Tumble gains a +5 dodge
bonus when executing the fight defensively standard or full-round
action, instead of a +2 bonus (or the +3 bonus from having 5 or more
ranks). Increase this dodge bonus by +1 for every 10 additional ranks
above 25 the character has. A character with 25 or more ranks in Tumble
gains a +10 dodge bonus to AC when executing the total defense standard
action, instead of a +4 bonus (or the +6 bonus from having 5 or more
ranks). Increase this dodge bonus by +2 for every 10 additional ranks
above 25 the character has.

## Use Magic Device

Use Magic Device does not possess an epic usage.

## Use Rope

The character can splice ropes together quickly, tie unique knots, and
even animate a rope he or she holds.

  ------------------- ----
  Task                DC
  Quick splicing      50
  Tie unique knot     60
  Animate held rope   80
  ------------------- ----

**Quick Splicing:**The character can splice two ropes together as a
move-equivalent action.

**Tie Unique Knot:**The character can tie a knot that only he or she
knows how to untie. This doesn't affect any Escape Artist checks made to
escape these bindings.

### Animate Held Rope
The character can command any rope he or she
holds as if it had the *animate rope* spell cast upon it (except that
using the skill in this way doesn't grant any bonus on Use Rope checks
made with the animated rope). Each command requires a separate Use Rope
check. Because the effect isn't magical, it can't be dispelled.

## Psionic Skills

### Autohypnosis

The character has trained his or her mind to ignore poison, resist
mental influence, and convince his or her body that he or she is tougher
than normal.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| DC                                | Task                              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Poison's DC + 5                   | When poisoned, the character can  |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

### Stabilize Self

Mortal wounds are less lethal for the character.

  ---- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DC   Task
  30   If reduced to negative hit points but not dead, make a Stabilize Self check. If successful, the character does not go unconscious and can continue taking actions until he or she bleeds to death or stabilizes (the character can also continue making stabilization checks). If healed or stabilized, the character continues to take actions normally.
  60   On a successful Stabilize Self check, the character gains damage reduction 2/--. The damage reduction lasts for 12 hours. The character cannot check for damage reduction more than once per day. Damage reduction gained through Stabilize Self does not stack with damage reduction gained through any other source.
  ---- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Miscellaneous

### *Scrying* Spells

To attempt any of these tasks, the *scrying* spell must be on your class
spell list (though it need not be among your spells known). If you have
any bonuses that would apply to the caster level of your *scrying*
spell, add these to your caster level check.

  ---------------- ----------------------------
  Task             DC
  Learn scryer     30
  Return scrying   50
  Break scrying    Opposed caster level check
  ---------------- ----------------------------

### Learn Scryer
If you determine that you're being scried upon, you
can learn the identity of the scryer with a DC 30 caster level check. If
successful, you learn the name, race, and location of the scryer.

### Return Scrying
If you determine that you're being scried upon, you
can look back through the sensor at the scryer with a DC 50 caster level
check. This allows you to spy on the scrying being as if you had cast a
*scrying* spell upon that person. This return scrying can be detected by
your target as normal.

### Break Scrying
If you determine that you're being scried, you can
make an opposed caster level check with the scryer. (Your caster level
must be at least 21st to attempt this task.) If you are successful, the
scrying ends, and the scryer may not target you with a Divination
(Scrying) spell or effect for a number of hours equal to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).
