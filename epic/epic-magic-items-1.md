# EPIC MAGIC ITEMS 1

While not truly an artifact, the epic magic item is a creation of such
power that it surpasses other magic items. Epic magic items are objects
of great power and value. The following are typical characteristics of
an epic magic item. In general, an item with even one of these
characteristics is an epic magic item.

-   Grants a bonus on attacks or damage greater than +5.
-   Grants an enhancement bonus to armor higher than +5.
-   Has a special ability with a market price modifier greater than +5.
-   Grants an armor bonus of greater than +10 (not including magic
    armor's enhancement bonus).
-   Grants a natural armor, deflection, or resistance bonus greater than
    +5.
-   Grants an enhancement bonus to an ability score greater than +6.
-   Grants an enhancement bonus on a skill check greater than +30.
-   Mimics a spell of an effective level higher than 9th.
-   Has a caster level above 20th.
-   Has a market price above 200,000 gp, not including material costs
    for armor or weapons, material component- or experience point-based
    costs, or additional value for intelligent items.

An epic magic item that grants a bonus beyond those allowed for normal
magic itemshas a higher market price than indicated by the formulas for
non-epic items.

Epic magic items are not artifacts. They are not unique, though they are
certainly very rare, and anyone with the proper item creation feats can
build them. Even an epic magic item can never grant a dodge bonus, and
the maximum inherent bonus that can be applied to an ability score is
+5. An epic magic item cannot be created that uses or mimics an epic
spell. A major artifact might be able to mimic such a spell, however.

## Creating Epic Magic Items

The process of creating an epic magic item is very similar to creating a
nonepic magic item. However, certain important differences exist.

## Caster Level

Spells with an effective level of 10th or higher are possible at epic
levels. Because these spell slots aren't automatically gained at a
particular level like 0- to 9th-level spells are, they don't have a
minimum caster level. For this reason, the minimum caster level for any
spell of 10th level or higher is set at 11 + spell level.

## Prerequisites

In addition to the materials and tools required for nonepic magic items,
any epic magic item requires at least two item creation feats: the epic
and nonepic version.

## Market Price

Use the guidelines for nonepic magic itemsto determine the market price
of an epic magic item, with one addition: If the item gives a bonus
beyond the limit allowed in for normal, nonepic magic items, multiply
the portion of the market price derived from that characteristic by 10.
Some epic characteristics, such as caster level, don't trigger this
multiplier.

### Experience Point Cost

The experience point cost to create an epic magic item is determined
differently than for a normal magic item. For all epic magic items other
than scrolls, divide the market price by 100, then add 10,000 XP to the
result. The final number is the experience point cost to create the
item.

For epic scrolls, divide the market price by 25 (as normal for creating
a nonepic scroll), then add 1,000 XP to the result. The final number is
the experience point cost to create the epic scroll.

### Magic Item Descriptions

In the following sections, each general type of magic item, such as
armor or scrolls, has an overall description, followed by descriptions
of specific items, if any. Each magic item description and table follows
the same format used for nonepic magic items. Specific exceptions are
noted as necessary.

## Armor

Except when otherwise stated, epic magic armor and shields follow the
rules for nonepic magic armor and shields.

There is no limit to the enhancement bonus of epic magic armor or
shields, to the market price modifier of epic magic armor or shield
special abilities, or to the total enhancement bonus and market price
modifier of epic magic armor or shields.

### Epic Armor and Shield Base Price

To find the base price of an epic suit of magic armor or an epic magic
shield, roll on Table: Armor and Shields. Note that the +6 to +10 rows
apply only to armor and shields that provide an enhancement bonus of +6
to +10 or armor and shields with a single special ability whose market
price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic armor and shields with a total
effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or
less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are
+5 or less use the table for nonepic magic armorto determine price.

  : Table: Shield Special Abilities

### Epic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions

Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items
can also have special abilities, such as those detailed below and
nonepic abilities. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at
least a +1 enhancement bonus.

### Acid Warding
The armor absorbs the first 50 points of acid damage
per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the *resist
energy* spell).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *protection from energy; Market Price:* +6
bonus.

### Cold Warding
The armor absorbs the first 50 points of cold damage
per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the *resist
energy* spell).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *protection from energy; Market Price:* +6
bonus.

### Exceptional Arrow Deflection
This shield functions like a *shield
of arrow deflection* except that it can deflect any type of ranged
attack (including spells that require a ranged touch attack) as if it
were an arrow. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged
attack, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged
attack has an enhancement bonus (or a spell level), the DC increases by
that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the attack. The
bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to
deflect a ranged attack doesn't count as an action.

*Caster Level:* 23rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *shield, wall of force; Market Price: +*8
bonus.

### Fire Warding
The armor absorbs the first 50 points of fire damage
per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the *resist
energy* spell).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *protection from energy; Market Price: +*6
bonus.

### Great Invulnerability
This suit of armor or shield grants the
wearer damage reduction. The damage reduction can be 10/magic, 15/magic,
5/epic, or 10/epic, depending on the armor.

*Caster Level:* 19th (10/magic), 20th (15/magic), 21st (5/epic), 22nd
(10/epic); *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic
Arms and Armor, *stoneskin, wish,* or *miracle; Market Price:+*4 bonus
(10/magic),+5 bonus (15/magic),+6 bonus (5/epic),+7 bonus (10/epic).

### Great Reflection
Any time its bearer of this shield is targeted
with a spell, it automatically reflects the spell back at the caster (as
the *spell turning* spell). The wearer can lower or raise this effect as
a free action (thus allowing beneficial spells in as desired).

*Caster Level:* 25th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *spell turning; Market Price: +*10 bonus.

### Great Spell Resistance
This suit of armor or shield grants the
wearer spell resistance. The spell resistance can be 21, 23, 25, or 27,
depending on the armor.

*Caster Level:* 21st (SR 21), 22nd (SR 23), 23rd (SR 25), 24th (SR 27);
*Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and
Armor, *spell resistance; Market Price: +*6 bonus (SR 21), +7 bonus (SR
23), +8 bonus (SR 25), +9 bonus (SR 27).

### Infinite Arrow Deflection
This shield functions like a *shield of
arrow deflection*, though it can deflect any number of projectiles or
thrown weapons each round. Any time the bearer would normally be struck
by a ranged weapon, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If
the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that
amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. The
bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to
deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged
weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or ranged spells, can't be
deflected.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *protection from arrows, shield; Market
Price: +*6 bonus.

### Lightning Warding
The armor absorbs the first 50 points of
lightning damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar
to the *resist energy* spell).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prereq-uisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *protection from energy; Market Price:
+*6 bonus.

### Negating
Immediately after the wearer of this armor is hit with a
magic weapon, the armor casts *greater dispelling* on the weapon. (In
the case of projectile weapons, the armor casts *greater dispelling* on
the weapon that fired the projectile if it is in range. If it is out of
range, the armor does nothing.) No weapon can be affected by the armor
more than once per day (regardless of the success of the dispel check).

*Caster Level:* 20th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *greater dispelling; Market Price: +*5 bonus.

### Sonic Warding
The armor absorbs the first 50 points of sonic damage
per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the *resist
energy* spell).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *protection from energy; Market Price: +*6
bonus.

creature wearing it. These negative levels persist as long as the armor
is worn and disappear when the armor is removed. The negative levels

of a great wyrm dragon. At the wearer's command, the armor sprouts
enormous dragon wings, allowing the wearer to fly at a speed of 90 feet
(clumsy) for a total of 4 hours each day. The armor also grants immunity
to a specific type of energy, based on the color of dragon that supplied
the armor. Roll d% on the following table to determine the color and

pounds. It grants the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma and
allows the wearer to attract and lead a number of followers as if he or

to attract a cohort). If the wearer already has the Leadership feat,
this armor has no cumulative effect on his or her followers.

## Weapons

Except when otherwise stated, epic magic weapons follow the rules for
nonepic magic weapons. There is no limit to an epic magic weapon's
enhancement bonus, to the market price modifier of an epic magic weapon
special ability, or to the total of an epic magic weapon's enhancement
bonus and market price modifier.

### Epic Weapon Base Price

To find the base price of an epic magic weapon, roll on Table: Weapons.
Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to weapons that provide an
enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or weapons with a single special ability
whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic weapons with a total
effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or
less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are
+5 or less use the table for nonepic magic weaponsto determine price.

  1 For weapons normally made of steel, roll d% to determine material: 01--85 steel; 86--99 adamantine; 100 other. Adjust price accordingly.

  3 Masterwork double weapons incur double the masterwork cost to account for each head (+300 gp masterwork cost per head for a total of +600 gp). Double weapons have separate bonuses for their different heads. If randomly determined, the second head of a double weapon has the same enhancement bonus as the main head (01--50 on d%), doubling the cost of the bonus, or its enhancement bonus is one less (51--100 on d%) and it has no special abilities.

  All magic weapons are masterwork weapons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  1 For weapons normally made of steel, roll d% to determine material: 01--85 steel; 86--99 adamantine; 100 other. Adjust price accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  2 Add to enhancement bonus on Table: Weapons to determine total market price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  3 Masterwork double weapons incur double the masterwork cost to account for each head (+300 gp masterwork cost per head for a total of +600 gp). Double weapons have separate bonuses for their different heads. If randomly determined, the second head of a double weapon has the same enhancement bonus as the main head (01--50 on d%), doubling the cost of the bonus, or its enhancement bonus is one less (51--100) and it has no special abilities.

  : Table: Specific Weapons

### Epic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions

Most magic weapons only have enhancement bonuses. They can also have
special abilities, such as those detailed below and nonepic abilities.A
weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

### Acidic Blast
On command, an acidic blast weapon drips acid (though
this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this acid splashes the
creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus acid damage. On a
successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of acid damage (or
+9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical
multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability
bestow the bonus acid damage upon their ammunition.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *acid fog; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Anarchic Power
This weapon is chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the
corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of anarchic power strikes
a lawful target, this power deals +3d6 points of bonus chaotic damage to
the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to
remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals
+6d6 points of chaotic damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6
and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and
four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon
bestows three negative levels on any lawful creature attempting to wield
it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and
disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels
never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any
way (including *restoration* spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows,
crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the anarchic
power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with
the nonepic anarchic special ability.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *word of chaos; Market Price: +*8 bonus.

### Axiomatic Power
This weapon is lawful-aligned and thus bypasses the
corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of axiomatic power
strikes a chaotic target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points
of bonus lawful damage to the target, and the target gains one negative
level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful
critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of lawful damage and bestows
two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical
multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical
multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any
chaotic creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as
long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer
wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but
they cannot be overcome in any way (including *restoration* spells)
while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this
special ability bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition. This
special ability does not stack with the nonepic axiomatic special
ability.

*Caster Level:* 23rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *dictum; Market Price: +*8 bonus.

### Distant Shot
A distant shot weapon can be used against any target
within line of sight at no penalty for range.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *discern location; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Dread
A dread weapon excels at attacking one type of creature.
Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +4 better
than its normal enhancement bonus. Further, it deals +4d6 points of
bonus damage against the foe, and if it scores a successful critical hit
against the foe, that creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 27) or be
destroyed instantly and turned to dust. (This even affects creatures
immune to critical hits or death magic.) To randomly determine a dread
weapon's designated foe, roll on the following table.

*Caster Level:* 22nd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *summon monster IX; Market Price: +*7 bonus.

  -------- ---------------------- --------- ---------------------

### Everdancing
An everdancing weapon is much like a dancing weapon,
though it can be loosed with a free action and will fight as long as
desired. It can move up to 60 feet away from its owner. Its owner can
instruct it to move to a different target as a move-equivalent action.
If its owner is rendered unconscious or otherwise unable to direct it,
it will fight the same opponent as long as that opponent is conscious
and within range. The owner of an everdancing weapon can grasp it again
as a free action (assuming it is within reach).

*Caster Level:* 23rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *animate objects; Market Price: +*8 bonus.

### Fiery Blast
On command, a fiery blast weapon is sheathed in fire
(though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this fire
engulfs the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus fire damage.
On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of fire damage
(or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical
multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability
bestow the bonus fire damage upon their ammunition.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *fireball; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Holy Power
This weapon is good-aligned and thus bypasses the
corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of holy power strikes an
evil target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus holy
(good) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level
(Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit
it instead deals +6d6 points of holy (good) damage and bestows two
negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical
multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical
multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any evil
creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as
the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer
wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but
they cannot be overcome in any way (including *restoration* spells)
while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this
special ability bestow the holy power upon their ammunition. This
special ability does not stack with the nonepic holy special ability.

*Caster Level:* 23rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *holy word; Market Price: +*8 bonus.

### Icy Blast
On command, an icy blast weapon is sheathed in icy cold
(though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this cold
washes over the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus cold
damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of
cold damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the
critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this
special ability bestow the bonus cold damage upon their ammunition.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *cone of cold; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Lightning Blast
On command, a lightning blast weapon crackles with
electrical energy (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any
hit, lightning coruscates around the creature struck, dealing +3d6
points of bonus electricity damage. On a successful critical hit it
instead deals +6d6 points of electricity damage (or +9d6 if the critical
multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows,
crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus
electricity damage upon their ammunition.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *lightning bolt; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Mighty Disruption
Any undead creature struck in combat must succeed
at a Fortitude save (DC 21) or be destroyed. A weapon of mighty
disruption must be a bludgeoning weapon. (If this property is rolled for
a piercing or slashing weapon, reroll.)

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *true resurrection; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Sonic Blast
On command, a sonic blast weapon emits a low thrumming
hum (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this
becomes a thunderous roar that deals +3d6 points of bonus sonic damage
to the creature struck. On a successful critical hit it instead deals
+6d6 points of sonic damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3,
or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings
with this special ability bestow the bonus sonic damage upon their
ammunition.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *shout; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Triple-Throw
This special ability can only be placed on a weapon
that can be thrown. (If this property is rolled for a weapon that cannot
be thrown, reroll.) A triple-throw weapon creates two duplicates of
itself when thrown. Both the original and the duplicate weapons attack
separately (at the same attack bonus). Regardless of the success of any
of the attacks, the duplicates immediately disappear after the attack is
completed. Any bonuses on damage due to accuracy or precision (including
those from sneak attacks, the Precise Shot feat, or the ranger's favored
enemy bonus) apply only to the original weapon's damage, not to the
duplicates.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *shades; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Unerring Accuracy
Ranged attacks made with this weapon negate the
AC bonus granted by any cover short of total cover. The weapon's ranged
attacks also ignore any miss chance from concealment (including total
concealment, but the must still aim his or her attacks at the correct
square).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *true seeing; Market Price: +*6 bonus.

### Unholy Power
This weapon is evil-aligned and this bypasses the
corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of unholy power strikes a
good target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus
unholy (evil) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative
level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful
critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of unholy (evil) damage and
bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the
critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the
critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on
any good creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain
as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no
longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss,
but they cannot be overcome in any way (including *restoration* spells)
while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this
special ability bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition. This
special ability does not stack with the nonepic unholy special ability.

*Caster Level:* 23rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *unholy word; Market Price: +*8 bonus.

to Create:* 1,790,308 gp + 45,800 XP.

### Gripsoul
*Gripsoul* is a +*6 keen long-sword,* but instead of
dealing additional damage on a critical hit, the weapon imprisons the
victim in a gem set in the pommel of the sword as per a *binding* spell
heightened to 16th level (DC 30). The same is true of any blow that
would otherwise kill a foe or knock him or her unconscious. Only one
creature can be so held, but the wielder can release the bound soul at
any time with a command word.

*Caster Level:* 27th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft

creatures.

Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *disintegrate; Market Price:* 1,000,312 gp;
*Cost to Create:* 500,312 gp + 20,000 XP.

### Quarterstaff of Alacrity
Both ends of this +*5 quarterstaff of
speed* have equal enhancement and special powers, meaning that it allows
an additional attack with each end every round. While the *quarterstaff
of alacrity* is held, it grants its wielder a +5 resistance bonus on
Reflex saves. It also deflects ranged weapons as if the wielder had the
Deflect Arrows and Infinite Deflection feats.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft
Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *protection from arrows, shield; Market

subject must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) for each negative level or
lose a level. If this sword's power causes a character to have negative
levels at least equal to his or her current level, the character is
instantly slain and the wielder gains an additional 10 temporary hit
points. Temporary hit points gained from this weapon last for a maximum
of 1 hour.

its wielder to fly at will (as the *fly* spell). Furthermore, the
wielder can move normally (including flying) even in the strongest
winds. When the weapon is drawn, the wielder gains electricity
resistance 30 and sonic resistance 30.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft

applying. This is a nonepic magic item.

### Epic Ring Descriptions

Standard epic rings are described below.

### Adamant Law
The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a
*shield of law* effect. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic
creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring

*unholy aura* effect. It bestows one negative level on any good creature
that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn
and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never

individual.

*Caster Level:* 20th; *Prerequisites:* Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring,

*Caster Level:* 20th; *Prerequisites:* Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring,
*protection from energy; Market Price:* 2,160,000 gp.

### Universal Energy Resistance, Greater

electricity, acid, and sonic. When the wearer would normally take such
damage, subtract 30 points of damage per round from the amount before
applying.

*Caster Level:* 20th; *Prerequisites:* Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring,
*protection from energy; Market Price:* 308,000 gp; *Cost to Create:*
154,000 gp + 13,080 XP.

### Virtuous Good
The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a
*holy aura* effect. It bestows one negative level on any evil creature
that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn

results in actual level loss, but it cannot be over-come in any way
(including *restoration* spells) while the ring is worn.

*Caster Level:* 15th; *Prerequisites:* Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring,
*holy aura,* creator must be good; *Market Price:* 250,000 gp; *Cost to
Create:* 125,000 gp + 12,500 XP.

### Weaponbreaking
A *ring of weaponbreaking* is identical to a *ring
of ironskin,* and has one additional power. Any weapon that successfully
strikes the wearer must also make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 20) or be
shattered into pieces.

*Caster Level:* 20th; *Prerequisites:* Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring,
*iron body, shatter; Market Price:* 600,000 gp; *Cost to Create:*
300,000 gp + 16,000 XP.

### Epic Psionics
This special crystal ring comes in a variety of types
useful only to psionic characters (characters who have power points per
day). The wearer's total power points per day are increased, depending
on the ring. The points granted are not bonus points---while the ring is
worn, it actually increases the wearer's points per day, but a night's
rest is required before gaining access to the increased power point per
day total. (Power points are not actually stored in the ring, as would
be the case for a crystal capacitor. Instead, the ring grants power
points by magnifying the manifester's own power.)

A *ring of epic psionics V* increases the wearer's daily power points by
43 points, a *ring of epic psionics VI* grants 63 power points, a *ring
of epic psionics VII* grants 87 power points, a *ring of epic psionics
VIII* grants 115 points, and a *ring of epic psionics IX* grants 147
power points.

*Manifester Level:* 23rd *(epic psionics* V), 26th *(epic psionics
VI),*29th *(epic psionics VII),*32nd *(epic psionics VIII),*35th *(epic
psionics IX);Prerequisites:* Craft Universal Item, Craft Epic Universal
Item, *great emulation; Market Price:* 250,000 gp *(epic psionics* V),

gp *(epic psionics VIII*), 810,000 gp *(epic psionics IX).*

  : Table: Epic Rods

### Epic Rod Descriptions

Standard epic rods are described below.

### Besiegement
This rod functions as a +*3 light mace.* In addition,
it is useful for besieging fortifications. Whenever the wielder makes a
charge attack, the rod improves to a +6 weapon. Twice per day, the rod
can create a battering ram that lasts for 24 rounds. This ram can strike
once per round, dealing 20 points of damage with each hit. It cannot be
used to target individuals, only fortifications. It can be damaged by
normal means (65 hp, AC 22), and *disintegrate* or *dispel magic*
destroys it. The rod also has the following powers: *Siege Engine:* One
heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three siege towers may be
generated with each use of this power. Each weapon created lasts for 12
hours. The power can be used three times per day. Ammunition for 20
shots is included with each weapon created.

*Transmute Rock to Mud:* This power can be used three times per day
(caster level 24th, save DC 17).

*Caster Level:* 24th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft
Magic Arms and Armor, *clenched fist, passwall, telepathic bond,
transmute rock to mud; Market Price:* 447,745 gp; *Cost to Create:*
224,025 gp + 14,474 XP.

### Epic Absorption
Like a *rod of absorption,* this rod draws
single-target or ray spells and spell-like abilities into itself,
nullifying the effect and storing the potential spell levels until the
wielder releases the energy in the form of spells of his or her own.
Spells of any level (including those boosted beyond 9th level by
metamagic) can be absorbed, although epic spells cannot. The rod absorbs
a maximum of 150 spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any
remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.

*Caster Level:* 23rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, empowered maximized *spell turning;
Market Price:* 1,500,000 gp.

### Epic Cancellation
This rod's touch drains an item of all magical
properties, including the magical energy in epic magic items (but not
most artifacts). The item touched gets a Will saving throw (DC 26). If a
creature is holding the magic item at the time, then the item can use
the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own. In such cases, contact
is established by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining three
items, the rod becomes brittle and useless. Drained items can only be
restored by *wish, miracle,* or epic spells specifically designed to
restore lost power. A *rod of epic cancellation* can neutralize a normal
*sphere of annihilation* without itself being cancelled.

*Caster Level:* 25th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
*dispel magic; Market Price:* 330,000 gp.

### Epic Might
This rod is similar to a *rod of lordly might,* although
it is far more powerful. It is larger than its normal counterpart, and
it is constructed of adamantine rather than normal metal. It has six
buttons, several spell-like functions, and several mundane uses, and it
can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts.

The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per
day.

-   *Dominate Person:* Touched foe is recipient of a *dominate person*
    spell, if the wielder so commands (Will save DC 24). The wielder
    must choose to use this power and then succeed with a melee touch
    attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is
    lost.
-   *Stun:* Upon command, all enemies viewing the rod are stunned, as
    per the *power word, stun* spell (10-foot maximum range, Will save
    DC 24). Invoking this power is a standard action.
-   *Damage:* Upon command, the rod deals 10d8 points of damage to an
    opponent on a successful touch attack and cures the wielder of a
    like amount of damage (Will save DC 26). The wielder must choose to
    use this power before attacking, as with *dominate person.*

The following weapon uses of the rod have no limits on their use.

-   In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +*6 heavy mace.*
-   When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +*3 longsword of fiery
    blasting.*
-   When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +*8 battleaxe.*
-   When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +*10 shortspear* or +*10
    longspear.*

The following mundane uses of the rod also have no limits on their use.

-   Climbing pole/ladder: When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can
    anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end
    sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5
    and 150 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed
    again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot
    apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike
    and hooks and can bear up to 10,000 pounds. The wielder can retract
    the pole by pushing button 5.
-   The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder
    plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced
    and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a
    Strength bonus of +24.
-   When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives
    the wielder a knowledge of his or her approximate depth beneath the
    surface or height above it.

*Caster Level:* 30th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft
Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, *cure critical
wounds, inflict critical wounds, bull's strength, fireball, dominate
person, power word stun; Market Price:* 4,293,432 gp; *Cost to Create:*
2,151,372 gp + 52,841 XP.

### Epic Negation
This rod negates the spell or spell-like function or
functions of magic items, including epic magic items (but not
artifacts). The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a beam
shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged
touch attack). The ray negates any currently active item function and
has a 75% chance to negate any other spell or spell-like functions of
that device, regardless of the level or power of the functions, for 2d4
rounds. To negate instantaneous effects, the rod wielder needs to have
readied an action. The target item gets no saving throw or means to
resist this effect. The rod can function three times per day.

*Caster Level:* 24th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
*dispel magic, limited wish* or *miracle; Market Price:* 446,000 gp.

### Epic Rulership
This rod appears to be a royal scepter worth at
least 25,000 gp in materials and work-manship alone. The wielder can
command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 360 feet when he or
she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 900 Hit
Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 17 or
higher are entitled to a Will saving throw (DC 29) to negate the effect.
Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if he or she were their absolute
sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the
nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be
used for 1,500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration
need not be continuous.

*Caster Level:* 25th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened *mass charm; Market Price:*
575,000 gp; *Cost to Create:* 300,000 gp + 15,500 XP.

### Epic Spellcaster
This magnificent adamantine rod grants its wielder
a +10 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made to cast epic spells for as
long as he or she holds or carries the rod.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod;
*Market Price:* 245,400 gp.

### Epic Splendor
This rod grants its wielder a +8 enhancement bonus to
Charisma for as long as he or she holds or carries the item. Three times
per day, the rod creates and garbs him or her in clothing of the finest
fabrics, plus adornments of fur and jewels. Apparel created by the rod
can remain in existence up to 24 hours. The value of the garb ranges
from 70,000 to 100,000 gp (1d4+6 x10,000 gp)---10,000 gp for the fabric,
50,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for jewel trim (maximum of 40 gems,
maximum value 1,000 gp each). In addition, the rod can, once per week,
create a palatial mansion in any floor plan the user desires. The
mansion is palatial, able to accommodate up to 250 people, housing them
in private chambers and serving them fine banquets. The mansion lasts
for three days, after which time it, and everything originally in it
(including items removed from the mansion), disappear.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
*fabricate, mage's magnificent mansion; Market Price:* 297,400 gp; *Cost
to Create:* 191,200 gp + 12,124 XP.

### Excellent Magic
Once per day when casting a nonepic or epic spell
that has an experience point component, the rod supplies up to 2,000 XP,
not the caster. If more experience points are required to cast the
spell, the caster provides them. As a special use of the rod, the caster
can substitute the power inherent in the rod for the experience point
development cost of an epic spell. Doing so drains all the power from
the rod, rendering it useless.

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod;
*Market Price:* 650,000 gp; *Cost to Create:* 325,000 gp + 26,000 XP.

### Fortification
This rod functions as a +*3 light mace.* In addition,
it is useful for the construction and defense of fortifications.
Whenever the wielder is benefiting from cover, the rod improves that to
nine-tenths cover (+10 cover AC bonus and +4 cover Reflex save bonus;
failure on the save results in half damage and success results in no
damage). Three times per day, the rod can create food and water, as per
the cleric spell, for twenty-four people. The rod also has the following
powers: *Fortify:* Four times per day, a stone wall can be created that
is 12 inches thick, 10 feet high, and 30 feet long. This wall has a
parapet and battlements across the top. (Alternatively, the power can be
used to mend a broken existing wall. The gap to be filled can be no more
than 300 square feet in area.) In addition, once per day, a great door
of iron can be created that is set into one of the newly created walls.
This door, 4 inches thick, may be a double door, a drawbridge, or a
portcullis, as chosen by the wielder. *Siege Engine:* One heavy
catapult, two light catapults, or three ballistae may be generated with
each use of this power. The power can be used four times per day.
Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.

*Caster Level:* 24th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft
Magic Arms and Armor, *inter-posing hand, create food and water, major
creation, wall of iron, wall of stone; Market Price:* 465,665 gp; *Cost
to Create:* 231,985 gp + 14,634 XP.

### Invulnerability
When held, this rod grants its wielder the
following powers.

-   +5 enhancement bonus to natural armor.
-   +5 resistance bonus on saving throws.
-   Damage reduction 15/adamantine.
-   Immunity to critical hits.
-   Spell resistance 32.

*Caster Level:* 20th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, *iron
body, resistance, spell resistance; Market Price:* 600,000 gp.

### Nightmares
Anyone who comes within 20 feet of the wielder of this
rod feels a grave sense of unease. Each person so affected must make a
Will save (DC 17) or suffer the effects of a *nightmare* spell the next
time he or she falls asleep. The wielder is immune to this effect. Three
times per day, the wielder can utter a command word that causes the rod
to emit a horrid, inhuman scream. Up to twenty of the closest creatures
within a 30-foot radius who hear this terrible wail believe that their
worst nightmares have become reality and suffer the effects of a *wail
of the banshee* spell (DC 23).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
*nightmare, permanency, wail of the banshee; Market Price:* 284,000 gp.

### Paradise
This item creates a nondimensional space, similar in
effect to a *rod of security.*However, the rod's possessor and up to 999
other creatures can stay in complete safety for up to 1,000 days divided
by the number of creatures affected. Natural healing takes place at five
times the normal pace. The rod functions like its nonepic counterpart in
all other ways.

*Caster Level:* 24th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened *gate; Market Price:*
610,000 gp.

### The Path
This rod serves as an aid to trailblazing and travel. It
grants the wielder a +30 enhancement bonus on Wilderness Lore checks for
tracking and Intuit Direction checks. The handle of the rod is hollow,
functioning like a telescope. When the wielder peers through it, the
limits of vision are three times normal (and spotting distances for
encounters are tripled). In addition, the telescoping handle enables the
wielder to view things as though affected by a *true seeing* spell. The
rod also has the following powers. *Map:* Three times per day a section
of the rod unrolls like a scroll from a tube, revealing a map of the
surrounding area, centered on the location of the rod. The area shown on
the map covers an area as small as 50 feet in radius to as large as 24
miles in radius, zooming in or out with a set of command words. The map
reveals natural topography and all types of structures (even hidden
ones), but it will not show the location of creatures.

*Passage:* Three times per day, this power allows the wielder and up to
five others in a 20-foot radius to move unhindered through natural plant
growth or bodies of water (as per the *freedom of movement* spell).

*Bridge:* Once per day, this power allows the user to create a
5-foot-wide, 40-foot-long stone cause-way across chasms and canyons. The
bridge created lasts for 1 hour.

*Pass without Trace:* Once per day, this power can be used on the
wielder and twenty others, for 21 minutes. It is otherwise as the spell
of the same name (caster level 24th).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, *find
the path, freedom of movement, pass without trace, wall of stone; Market
Price:* 306,870 gp.

### Restless Death
The holder of this rod can rebuke or control undead
as if he or she were four levels higher. (The rod doesn't grant the
ability to rebuke or control undead if the holder doesn't already have
it.) In addition, the wielder may speak a command word to cast *animate
dead*. Any skeletons or zombies animated by the rod's power are
automatically controlled by the rod, up to the rod's maximum limit of 42
HD, and they follow the orders of the rod's wielder. These undead don't
count toward the wielder's limit of controlled undead. Finally, the
wielder can speak a second command word to cast *slay living*
(heightened to 10th level; DC 25).

*Caster Level:* 21st; *Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
*animate dead, control undead, slay living; Market Price:* 625,000 gp.

### Wyrm
Any of the various rods in this series functions as a +*5
quarterstaff.* Upon casting the rod to the ground (a standard action)
and uttering a command word, the rod grows into a specific type of
dragon (depending on the specific type of rod) by the end of the round.
The dragon created is a wyrm and obeys the commands of the owner. The
dragon returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder
desires, or whenever it moves farther than 500 feet from the owner. If
the dragon form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated
again for three days. A *wyrm rod* only functions if the possessor is of
the same alignment as the dragon type.

*Caster Level:* 34th (white or brass), 35th (black or copper), 36th
(green or bronze), 37th (blue or silver), 38th (red or gold);
*Prerequisites:* Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, Improved Heighten Spell, improved
