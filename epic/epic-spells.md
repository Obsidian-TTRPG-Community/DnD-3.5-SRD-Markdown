## What Are Epic Spells?

Epic spells are spells developed from the ground up using a list of
magical ingredients called seeds. Despite their power, epic spells still
follow the basic rules for casting spells, except as specifically noted
otherwise. Epic casters can manipulate the seeds of true magic, but
knowing the seeds and how to manipulate them does not instantly grant
ultimate power. Each epic spell must be laboriously developed before it
can be used.

## Acquiring Epic Spells

A character with the Epic Spellcasting feat may start acquiring epic
spells immediately. Using epic spells is a two-step procedure:
development and spellcasting.

## Epic Spell Development

Before it can be cast, an epic spell must be developed. The process of
development can be a time-consuming and expensive process. It is during
development that a caster determines whether a given epic spell lies
within his or her abilities or beyond them. The basis of that
determination lies in an epic spell's Spellcraft DC.

The easiest way to develop an epic spell is to use one already given.
The description of each of these unique spells gives the amount of gold,
time, and experience points required to develop the spell. If a
character pays a spell's development cost, he or she develops (and thus
knows) that spell.

For information on developing an epic spell completely from scratch, see
Developing Unique Epic Spells, below.

## Epic Spellcasting

Once an epic spell is developed, the caster knows the spell. A developed
epic spell becomes an indelible part of the caster and may be prepared
without a spellbook (if a wizard is the caster). Characters who cast
spells spontaneously, such as sorcerers, can cast a developed epic spell
by using any open epic spell slot. Druids, clerics, and similar
spellcasters can likewise prepare epic spells using epic spell slots.

A spellcaster can prepare or cast any epic spell he or she knows as many
times per day as he or she has available epic spell slots. A spellcaster
who can cast epic spells has a number of open epic spell slots per day
equal to one-tenth his or her ranks in the Knowledge skill appropriate
to the spell and the caster's class. Knowledge (arcana) is appropriate
for arcane casters, and Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (nature) is
appropriate for divine casters. The rules for rest between casting a
day's allotment of epic spells are the same as for rest required to
prepare standard spells. If the caster doesn't use up a day's allotment
of epic spell slots, the unused slots remain available whether or not
the spellcaster receives appropriate rest.

Even if the epic spell has been developed and an epic spell slot is
available, successfully casting an epic spell isn't assured. The
caster's Spellcraft skill modifier is vital for casting an epic spell.
To cast an epic spell, a spellcaster makes a Spellcraft check against
the epic spell's Spellcraft DC. If the check succeeds, the spell is
cast. If the caster fails the check, the epic spell fizzles and the epic
spell slot is used for the day.

Because epic spells require Spellcraft checks, a spell is beyond the
caster's ability if the final Spellcraft DC is greater than 20 + the
spellcaster's Spellcraft modifier. Epic spells with DCs higher than 10 +
the spellcaster's Spellcraft modifier are risky; a caster can take 10
when casting an epic spell, but he or she can't take 20. When routinely
casting epic spells, most spellcasters take 10 on their Spellcraft
checks.

**Epic Spell Levels:** Epic spells have no fixed level. However, for
purposes of Concentration checks, spell resistance, and other possible
situations where spell level is important, epic spells are all treated
as if they were 10th-level spells.

**Metamagic, Items, and Epic Spells:** Metamagic feats and other epic
feats that manipulate normal spells cannot be used with epic spells.

A character can't craft a magic item that casts an epic spell,
regardless of whether the item is activated with spell completion, a
spell trigger, a command word, or simple use. Only major artifacts,
which are beyond the means of even epic characters to create, can
possibly contain magic of this power.

The saving throw against a character's epic spell has a DC of 20 + the
character's relevant ability score modifier. It's possible to develop
epic spells that have even higher DCs, however, by applying the
appropriate factor.

## Epic Spell Terms

**Epic Spell:** Spells that are different from common spells. Epic
spells are usually custom-made. Epic spells do not take up normal spell
slots, but instead are gained and used under a completely separate
progression.

**Epic Spell Slots:** A character must have an available epic spell slot
to prepare or cast an epic spell, just as he or she needs a normal spell
slot for a nonepic spell. A character doesn't gain epic spell slots by
virtue of his or her level and class, however. A character gets one epic
spell slot for every 10 ranks he or she has in the relevant Knowledge
skill.

**Factor:** When creating an epic spell, a character can modify the
basic use of a seed. Each modification is called a factor, and most
factors increase the difficulty of casting the spell.

**Mitigating Factor:** The opposite of a normal factor, a mitigating
factor modifies the spell but makes it easier to cast.

**Seed:** Every custom epic spell created by spellcasters begins with a
base effect called a seed. Seeds are the fundamental building blocks of
epic spells.

**Spellcraft DC:** For epic spells, the Spellcraft DC is a measure of
how difficult the spell is for a spellcaster to cast. It also measures
how powerful an epic spell is.

## Epic Spell Formulas and Calculations

The following formulas are important to epic spellcasters.

**Epic Spells Per Day:** Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or
Knowledge (nature) ranks รท 10 (round down).

**To Cast an Epic Spell:** Spellcraft check (DC = epic spell's
Spellcraft DC).

**Level of an Epic Spell:** Epic spells are considered 10th level for
the purpose of Concentration checks, spell resistance, and other
determinations.

**Saving Throw for an Epic Spell:** DC = 20 + key ability modifier.

## Dispelling,Epic Spells,and Antimagic Field {#dispelling-epic-spells-and-antimagic-field}

A lucky nonepic spellcaster casting *greater dispel magic* might be able
to dispel an epic spell. The game mechanics do not change, and epic
spells do not occupy any privileged position allowing them to resist
being dispelled other than their presumably high caster level. Likewise,
epic spells using the *dispel* seed can dispel nonepic spells. Such epic
spells use the same game mechanic: The check to dispel is 1d20 + a
specified number (usually dispeller's level), and the DC is 11 + the
spellcaster's level.

*Antimagic field* does not automatically suppress epic spells as it does
standard spells. Instead, each time an epic spell is subject to an
*antimagic field,*make a dispel check as a 20th-level caster (1d20 +
20). The epic spell has a DC of 11 + the epic spell's spellcaster level.
If the suppression check is successful, the epic spell is suppressed
like any other spell. If the dispel check is unsuccessful, the epic
spell functions normally.

## Epic Spell Descriptions

Each epic spell description follows the same format used for 0- to
9th-level spells. There are two additional entries for epic spells:
Spellcraft DC and To Develop.

**Spellcraft DC:** This is the DC of the Spellcraft check required to
cast the epic spell. When casting an epic spell, the character gains a
+5 bonus on his or her Spellcraft check if the base seed of the epic
spell is from the character's arcane school specialty or primary psionic
discipline. The character takes a --15 penalty if the epic spell seed is
from his or her prohibited arcane school.

**To Develop:** The first part of this entry shows the resources in
gold, time, and experience points a character must expend to develop the
spell shown. If the character expends the resources, he or she develops
the spell if he or she has access to all the seeds. Spells containing
the *life* or *heal* seed are typically only available to those with 24
or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (nature). The rest of
the development entry details the seeds and factors used to create the
epic spell. This information is provided as an example for characters
when they attempt to create and develop their own unique epic spells.

## Animus Blast

-   Evocation \[Cold\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 50
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Area:** 20-ft.-radius hemisphere burst
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 450,000 gp; 9 days; 18,000 XP. Seeds: *energy* (DC
    19), *animate dead* (DC 23). Factors: set undead type to skeleton
    (--12 DC), 1-action casting time (+20 DC).

When this spell is cast, enemies within range are dealt 10d6 points of
cold damage. However, up to twenty of those victims that perish as a
result of this blast are then instantly animated as Medium skeletons.
These skeletons serve the character indefinitely. The character cannot
exceed the normal limit for controlling undead through use of this
spell, but other means that allow the character to exceed the normal
limit for controlled undead work just as well with undead created with
*animus blast.*

## Animus Blizzard

-   Evocation \[Cold\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 78
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Area:** 20-ft.-radius hemisphere burst
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 702,000 gp; 15 days; 28,080 XP. Seeds: *energy* (DC
    19), *animate dead* (DC 23). Factors: increase damage to 30d6 (+40
    DC), set undead type to wight (--4 DC).

When this spell is cast, enemies within range are dealt 30d6 points of
cold damage. However, up to five victims that perish as a result of this
blast are then instantly animated as wights. These five wights serve the
character indefinitely. The character cannot exceed the normal limit for
controlling undead through use of this spell, but other means that allow
the character to exceed the normal limit for controlled undead work just
as well with undead created with *animus blizzard.*

## Contingent Resurrection

-   Conjuration (Healing)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 52
-   **Components:** V, S , D F
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** You or creature touched
-   **Duration:** Contingent until expended, then instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **To Develop:** 468,000 gp; 10 days; 18,720 XP. Seed: *life* (DC
    27). Factor: activates when subject is slain (+25 DC).

*Contingent resurrection* returns the subject to life if he or she is
slain. Once cast, the spell remains quiescent and does not activate
until the trigger conditions have been met (but each day it remains
untriggered, it uses up an epic spell slot, even if the character cast
it on another creature). Once triggered, the spell is expended. If the
subject is killed (the trigger), he or she is restored to life and
complete health 1 minute later, so long as even a tiny bit of dust
remains for *contingent resurrection* to act upon. A shaft of light
shines down from the heavens, illuminating the subject and everything
within 20 feet. The creature is restored to full hit points, vigor, and
health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the subject loses one
level (or 1 point of Constitution if the subject was 1st level).
*Contingent resurrection* does not work on a creature that has died of
old age.

## Create Living Vault [(Ritual)]{.small} {#create-living-vault}

-   Conjuration (Creation)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 58
-   **Components:** V, S, XP
-   **Casting Time:** 100 days, 11 minutes
-   **Range:** 0 ft.
-   **Effect:** One living vault, 50 ft. by 50 ft. by 10 ft.
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** None
-   **To Develop:** 540,000 gp; 11 days; 21,600 XP. Seeds: *animate*
    (DC 25) large chunk of stone, *fortify* (DC 27). Factors: allow
    vault to "grow" to proper size after created in 4d4 days (ad hoc +20
    DC), increase HD of object by 92 (+184 DC), grant magical immunity
    (ad hoc +105 DC), increase damage reduction to 15 (+28 DC) and to
    /epic (+15 DC), make permanent (x5 DC). Mitigating factors: increase
    casting time by 10 minutes (--20 DC), increase casting time by 100
    days (--200 DC), 9d6 backlash (--9 DC), seven additional casters
    contributing one epic spell slot (โ133 DC), burn 20,000 XP per epic
    caster (โ1,600 DC).

The character creates a construct known as a living vault to protect and
hide his or her treasures. Upon completion, the vault initially measures
only 5 feet on a side, but it gradually increases to its proper size
over the following 4d4 days. The vault is attuned to the character,
allowing him or her alone entrance and egress in a manner similar to a
*dimension door* spell. When the character desires the vault to hide
itself, he or she gives it a simple command. To summon the vault, the
character may cast a *sending* spell or arrange some other manner to
contact it.

*XP Cost:* 20,000 XP.

## Crown of Vermin

-   Conjuration (Summoning)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 56
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Effect:** Aura of one thousand insects that surrounds you in a
    10-ft.-radius spread
-   **Duration:** 20 rounds (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 504,000 gp; 11 days; 20,160 XP. Seeds: *summon* (DC
    14), *fortify* (DC 17). Factors: summon vermin mass instead of one
    creature (ad hoc +8 DC), grant damage reduction 1/epic (+15 DC),
    allow mass to move at your speed (ad hoc +2 DC), perfect control of
    vermin (ad hoc +2 DC). Mitigating factor: change range to personal
    (--2 DC).

After casting *crown of vermin,* one thousand venomous, biting and
stinging spiders, scorpions, beetles, and centipedes erupt from the very
air around the character. This swarm forms a living aura around the
character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her
own *crown of vermin.*The swarm goes where the character goes at his or
her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water
drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is
cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call
and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the *crown of vermin* bites
a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character
forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point
of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to
kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a
Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if
successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total
of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the
*crown of vermin.*The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the
vermin's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction. If there aren't enough vermin to kill all
the creatures in the spell's effect, the creature with the fewest hit
points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit
points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been
killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally.

The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and
can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The
character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free
action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are
suppressed does not count toward the spell's duration. Alternatively,
the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or
she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a
move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from the
character's control through any means. The vermin make all saving throws
to avoid damaging effects using the character's base saving throw
bonuses. They gain the character's spell resistance, if any, and they
get saving throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay
vermin. A character can see through his or her *crown of vermin* without
difficulty, but gains one-half concealment against enemy attacks
launched both outside and within the character's *crown of vermin.*

## Damnation

-   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Teleportation\] \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 97
-   **Components:** V, S, XP
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous (20 hours for compulsion)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 873,000 gp; 18 days; 34,920 XP. Seeds: *foresee* (to
    preview likely hellscape) (DC 17), *transport* (DC 27), *compel* (to
    keep target in hell) (DC 19). Factors: interplanar travel (+4 DC),
    unwilling target (+4 DC), 1-action casting time (+20 DC), +15 to DC
    of subject's save (+30 DC). Mitigating factor: burn 2,400 XP (--24
    DC).

The character sends his or her foe to hell. If the character succeeds at
a melee touch attack, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC
= the standard epic spell DC + 15). If he or she fails this saving
throw, he or she is sent straight to a layer of a lawful evil plane (or
a chaotic evil plane, at the character's option) swarming with fiends.
The subject will not willingly leave the plane for 20 hours, believing
that his or her predicament is a just reward for an ill-spent life. Even
after the compulsion fades, he or she must devise his or her own escape
from the plane. Unless the GM devises a specific location and scenario
in the Nine Hells, the subject encounters a group of 1d4 pit fiends (or
balors, if in a chaotic evil plane) every hour he or she spends in hell.

*XP Cost:* 2,000 XP.

## Demise Unseen

-   Necromancy (Death, Evil), Illusion (Figment)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 80
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature of up to 80 HD
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fort negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 738,000 gp; 15 days; 29,520 XP. Seeds: *slay* (DC
    25), *animate dead* (DC 23), *delude* (DC 14). Factors: change
    undead type to ghoul (--10 DC), apply to all five senses (+8 DC),
    1-action casting time (+20 DC).

The character instantly slays a single target and at the same moment
animate the body so that it appears that nothing has happened to the
creature. The target's companions (if any) do not immediately realize
what has transpired. The target receives a Fortitude saving throw to
survive the attack. If the save fails, the target remains in its exact
position with no apparent ill effects. In reality, it is now a ghoul
under the character's control. The target's companions notice nothing
unusual about the state of the target until they interact with it, at
which time each companion receives a Will saving throw to notice
discrepancies. The ghoul serves the character indefinitely. The
character cannot exceed the normal limit for controlling undead through
use of this spell, but other means that allow the character to exceed
the normal limit for controlled undead work just as well with undead
created with *demise unseen.*

## Dire Winter

-   Evocation \[Cold\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 319
-   **Components:** V, S , X P
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 1,000 ft.
-   **Area:** 1,000-ft.-radius emanation
-   **Duration:** 20 hours
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** None
-   **To Develop:** 2,871,000 gp; 58 days; 114,840 XP. Seed: *energy*
    (emanate 2d6 cold in 10-ft. radius) (DC 19). Factor: 100 times
    increase in base area (+400 DC). Mitigating factor: burn 10,000 XP
    (--100 DC).

The creature or object targeted emanates bitter cold to a radius of
1,000 feet for 20 hours. The emanated cold deals 2d6 points of damage
per round against unprotected creatures (the target is susceptible if
not magically protected or otherwise resistant to the energy). The
intense cold freezes water out of the air, causing constant snowfall and
wind. The snow and wind produce a blizzard effect within the area.

*XP Cost:* 10,000 XP.

## Dragon Knight [(Ritual)]{.small} {#dragon-knight}

-   Conjuration (Summoning) \[Fire\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 38
-   **Components:** V, S, Ritual
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Effect:** One summoned adult red dragon
-   **Duration:** 20 rounds (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 342,000 gp; 7 days; 13,680 XP. Seed: *summon* (DC
    14). Factors: summon creature other than outsider (+10 DC), summon
    CR 14 creature (+24 DC), 1-action casting time (+20 DC). Mitigating
    factor: two additional casters contributing 8th-level spell slots
    (--30 DC).

This spell summons an adult red dragon. It appears where the character
designates and acts immediately. It attacks the character's opponents to
the best of its abilities (on the first round, it prefers to breathe
fire on an enemy, if possible). The character can direct the dragon not
to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
This is a ritual spell requiring two other spellcasters, each of which
must contribute an unused 8th-level spell slot to the casting.

## Dragon Strike [(Ritual)]{.small} {#dragon-strike}

-   Conjuration (Summoning) \[Fire\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 50
-   **Components:** V, S, Ritual, XP
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Effect:** Ten summoned adult red dragons
-   **Duration:** 20 rounds (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 450,000 gp; 9 days; 18,000 XP. Seed: *summon* (DC
    14). Factors: summon creature other than outsider (+10 DC), summon
    CR 14 creature (+24 DC), summon ten creatures (x10 DC), 1-action
    casting time (+20 DC). Mitigating factors: eleven additional casters
    contributing 9th-level spell slots (--187 DC), burn 2,000 XP per
    caster (--240 DC), 3d6 backlash (โ3 DC).

This spell summons ten adult red dragons. They appear where the
character designates and act immediately. They attack the character's
opponents to the best of their abilities (on the first round, they all
prefer to simultaneously breathe fire on an enemy, if possible). The
character can direct the dragons not to attack, to attack particular
enemies, or to perform other actions.

*XP Cost:* 2,000 XP (per caster).

## Dreamscape

-   Conjuration \[Teleportation\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 29
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** You and other touched willing creatures weighing up to
    1,000 lb.
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Yes (harmless) (see text) S
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **To Develop:** 261,000 gp; 6 days; 10,400 XP. Seed: *transport* (DC
    27). Factor: transport to region of dreams (+2 DC).

The character and any creatures he or she touches are drawn into the
region of dreams. The character can take more than one creature along
(subject to the character's weight limit), but all must be touching each
other. The character physically enters the land of dreams, leaving
nothing behind. For every minute the character moves through the dream
landscape, he or she can "wake" to find him or her self five miles
displaced in the waking world. The character does not know precisely
where he or she will come out in the waking world, nor the conditions of
the waking world through which the character travels. The character
knows approximately where he or she will end up based on time spent
traveling in dream. *Dreamscape* can also be used to travel to other
planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires
crossing into the dreams of outsiders, where the character is subject to
the dangers of alien dream realities. This is a potentially perilous
proposition. Transferring to another plane of existence requires 1d4
hours of uninterrupted journey. Any creatures touched by the character
when *dreamscape* is cast also make the transition to the borders of
unconscious thought. They may opt to follow the character, wander off
into the dreams of others, or stumble back into the waking world (50%
chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by
the character). Creatures unwilling to accompany the character into the
region of dreams receive a Will save, negating the effect if successful.

## Eclipse

-   Conjuration (Creation) \[Transportation\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 42
-   **Components:** V, S , X P
-   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** 200 miles
-   **Area:** 5-mile radius, centered on you
-   **Duration:** Up to 8 hours (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 378,000 gp; 8 days; 15,1200 XP. Seeds: *conjure* (DC
    21), *transport* (to move disk into position 100 miles up) (DC 27).
    Factors: increase mass by 1,000% (+40 DC), spread mass into
    paper-thin disk (ad hoc +2 DC), keep disk in place for 8 hours (ad
    hoc +10 DC). Mitigating factors: increase casting time by 9 minutes
    (--18 DC), burn 4,000 XP (--40 DC).

With this spell, the character can create a limited eclipse, as though a
heavenly body moves between the sun and the earth. The landscape within
a five-mile radius of the character's location experiences the dimming
of the sun as a disk the character creates passes in front of it,
culminating in a complete blackout and accompanying coronal ring. The
eclipse follows the character across the landscape for up to 8 hours, or
until the sun goes down, or until the character dismisses the eclipse.
The character does not need to concentrate on the eclipse while it
lasts.

*XP Cost:* 4,000 XP.

## Eidolon

-   Conjuration (Creation) \[Transportation\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 79
-   **Components:** V, S , X P
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 5 ft.
-   **Effect:** One duplicate of caster
-   **Duration:** 8 hours
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 711,000 gp; 15 days; 28,440 XP. Seed: *conjure* (to
    make base substance) (DC 21), *transform* (DC 21), *transport* (to
    move part of caster's soul into duplicate) (DC 27). Factors:
    nonliving substance to humanoid (+10 DC), transform into specific
    individual (+25 DC). Mitigating factor: burn 2,500 XP (--25 DC).

Upon casting *eidolon,* the character creates a duplicate version of him
or her self as the character was when he or she was a 21st-level
character, and the character gains one negative level while the
duplicate persists. For each additional negative level the character
bestow upon him or her self at the time of casting, the eidolon has one
additional character level. No matter how many negative levels the
character bestows on him or her self, the eidolon can never have more
character levels than the character has (taking the negative levels into
account). Treat the duplicate as the character with a number of negative
levels conferred that would lower him or her to the character level of
the eidolon. The eidolon is considered fresh and rested when created. It
may cast any spell the character has access to, including an epic spell.
Use the eidolon's Spellcraft modifier as the basis for the number of
epic spells it can cast in a day, and its effective character level as a
basis for its skills, feats, and other abilities. The eidolon is
effectively lower level than the character and probably can't cast all
the spells he or she knows. A powerful enough eidolon might conceivably
cast the *eidolon* spell itself. The eidolon appears in whatever mundane
clothing the character desires when initially conjured, but it has no
other possessions. It shares part of the character's soul, so it is the
character for all intents and purposes. The character and his or her
*eidolon* communicate with each other normally. Usually, the eidolon
does not begrudge its brief existence, because it is still part of the
character. If the eidolon is killed prior to the expiration of the
spell's duration, the character immediately regains the lost levels.
Normally, the eidolon does not last long enough to threaten the
character with permanent level drain.

*XP Cost:* 2,500 XP.

## Enslave [(Ritual)]{.small} {#enslave}

-   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 80
-   **Components:** V, S, XP
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Target:** One living creature
-   **Duration:** Permanent
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 720,000 gp; 15 days; 28,800 XP. Seed: compel (DC
    19). Factors: stricter compulsion of any creature (ad hoc +11 DC),
    1-action casting time (+20 DC), permanent (x5 DC). Mitigating
    factors: 2d6 backlash (--2 DC), four additional casters contributing
    one 9th-level spell slot (--68 DC), burn 2,000 XP per caster (--100
    DC).

The character makes a permanent thrall of any living creature. The
character establishes a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If the
creature has a language, the character can generally force the subject
to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of its abilities. If
the creature has no language, the character can communicate only basic
commands. The character knows what the subject is experiencing, but does
not receive direct sensory input from it. A subject forced to take an
action against its nature receives a saving throw with a penalty of --10
to resist taking that particular action, but if it succeeds, it still
remains the character's thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject
makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all
future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a
penalty. *Protection from evil* or a similar spell can prevent the
character from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the
subject is so protected, but it does not prevent the establishment of
*enslave* or dispel it.

*XP Cost:* 2,000 XP.

## Epic Counterspell

-   Abjuration
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 69
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature or object
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 621,000 gp; 13 days; 24,840 XP. Seed: *dispel* (DC
    19). Factors: +30 to dispel check (+30 DC), 1-action casting time
    (+20 DC).

To use *epic counterspell,*select an opponent as the target. The
character does this by readying an action, electing to wait to complete
his or her action until the opponent tries to cast a spell (the
character may still move his or her speed, because readying a
counterspell is a standard action). If the target tries to cast a spell,
make a dispel check: Roll d20+40 against a DC of 11 + the foe's caster
level. If the check is successful, the character's spell negates the
foe's spell.

## Epic Mage Armor

-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
-   **To Develop:** 414,000 gp; 9 days; 16,560 XP. Seed: *armor* (DC
    14). Factor: +16 additional armor bonus (+32 DC).

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of *epic
mage armor,* providing a +20 armor bonus to Armor Class. Unlike mundane
armor, *epic mage armor* entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell
failure chance, or speed reduction. Because *epic mage armor* is made of
force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal
armor.

## Epic Repulsion

-   **Spellcraft DC:** 52
-   **Components:** V, S

    14). Factor: permanent ๏จ5 DC). Mitigating factor: increase casting
    time by 9 minutes (--18 DC).

The character can create a permanent ward against a specific creature
type. Any creature of the specified type cannot attack or touch the
warded creature or object. The protection ends if the warded creature
makes an attack against or intentionally moves to within 5 feet of a
specified creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome
this protection and touch the warded creature.

## Epic Spell Reflection

    casting time by 10 minutes (--20 DC), increase casting time by 41
    days (--82 DC), 20d6 backlash (--20 DC), six additional casters
    contributing one 8th-level spell slot (--90 DC), burn 9,500 XP per
    caster (--665 DC).

The character can create a permanent ward against all spells of 1st
through 9th level that target the subject. These spells are reflected
back on the caster. Spells that affect an area are not affected by this
spell.

The character grants the subject touched spell resistance 35 until the
duration expires. The spell resistance granted does not stack, but
overlaps with, any previous spell resistance. This is a ritual spell,
requiring two other spellcasters, each of whom must contribute an unused
6th-level spell slot to the casting.

## Greater Ruin

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 59
-   **Components:** V, S , X P
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 12,000 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature, or up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving
    matter
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude half

remains. *XP Cost:* 2,000 XP.

## Hellball

-   Evocation \[Acid, Fire, Electricity, Sonic\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 90
-   **Components:** V, S , X P
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Area:** 40-ft.-radius spread
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 810,000 gp; 17 days; 32,400 XP. Seed: *energy*
    (deals 10d6 each of acid, fire, electricity, sonic) (DC 76).
    Factors: double base area (+6 DC), 1-action casting time (+20 DC).
    Mitigating factors: 10d6 backlash (--10 DC), burn 200 XP (--2 DC).

damage, 10d6 points of electricity damage, and 10d6 points of sonic
damage to all creatures within the area. Unattended objects also take
this damage. The character takes 10d6 points of damage upon casting (in
addition to burning 200 XP). The character points his or her finger and
determine the range (distance and height) at which the *hellball* is to
detonate. A sun-bright, fist-sized globe of energy streaks forth and,
unless it impacts a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining
the indicated range, expands into its full area.

*XP Cost: 2*00 XP.

## Kinetic Control

-   Abjuration
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 100
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Personal; touch
-   **Target:** You; creature or object touched
-   **Duration:** 12 hours or until discharged
-   **To Develop:** 927,000 gp; 19 days; 37,080 XP. Seeds: *ward* (5
    points against bludgeoning and piercing) (DC 14), *reflect* (DC 27).
    Factors: also against slashing (+4 DC), additional 15 points of
    protection (+30 DC), contingent reflection of damage on creature
    touched (+25 DC).

Once a character has cast this spell, he or she can absorb, store, and
redirect the energy contained in any physical (melee or ranged) attack.
The character absorbs 20 points of each separate slashing, bludgeoning,
and piercing attack made against him or her, saving it for later. A
character can absorb up to 150 points of damage in this fashion;
however, if the stored damage is not discharged prior to reaching the
150-point limit, the spell automatically discharges, dealing the 150
points of damage to the character. The character keeps track of the
number of points of damage he or she has absorbed (the character doesn't
have to keep track of the type of damage). At any time during the
spell's duration, the character can make a touch attack against another
creature or object. If successful, the character deals the target some
or all (character's choice) of the points of damage he or she has
stored. The damage delivered is considered bludgeoning damage. A
character can absorb and discharge damage any number of times during the
spell's duration, so long as the character doesn't absorb more than 150
points at a time. When the spell expires, any stored damage the
character has not redirected is discharged into the character.

## Let Go of Me

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 43
-   **Components:** None
-   **Casting Time:** 1 free action
-   **Range:** Touch (see text)
-   **Target:** One creature or force grappling you
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 387,000 gp; 8 days; 15,480 XP. Seed: *destroy* (DC
    29). Factors: quickened (+28 DC), no verbal or somatic components
    (+4 DC). Mitigating factors: limited circumstance (ad hoc --8 DC),
    10d6 backlash (--10 DC).

The character deals 20d6 points of damage to any creature grappling him
or her. The damage dealt is of no particular type or energy---it is a
purely destructive impulse. If grappled by a magical force the force is
automatically destroyed.

## Living Lightning

-   Evocation \[Electricity\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 140
-   **Components:** None
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft. or 150 ft.
-   **Area:** A bolt 5 ft. wide by 300 ft. long, or 10 ft. wide by 150
    ft. long
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 1,260,000 gp; 26 days; 50,400 XP. Seeds: *life* (DC
    27), *energy* (DC 19). Factors: 1-action casting time (+20 DC), no
    verbal or somatic components (+4 DC), giving life to a spell (ad hoc
    x2 DC).

The character develops a spell that he or she can cast; thereafter, the
spell can effectively "cast itself." When the character casts the spell,
a stroke of energy deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to each
creature within the spell's area. *Living lightning* follows all the
standard rules for epic spell casting when the character casts it.
*Living lightning* is sentient and generally friendly toward the
character. It has the character's mental ability scores, but it has no
physical ability scores. It senses the world through the character's
senses and communicates with him or her by thought. As a self-triggering
spell, it isn't truly alive but is a fragment of the character's
personality. It cares little for the world around it, but at the
character's urging (and sometimes at its own discretion) it casts itself
at his or her foes. Casters who prepare spells before casting must
prepare *living lightning* normally in order for it to cast itself. When
the spell casts itself, it acts on the character's initiative but does
not count against his or her own actions in the round. The character
cannot simultaneously cast *living lightning* while it is casting its
own effect, even if it has been prepared more than once. *Living
lightning* uses up one of the character's epic spell slots for the day
whenever it casts itself. When the character has used up all his or her
epic spell slots for the day (or has cast all his or her prepared
*living lightning* spells, if a caster who must prepare spells), *living
lightning* becomes quiescent. It remains so until the character has
rested to regain his or her epic spell slots for the next day.

## Lord of Nightmares

-   Conjuration (Summoning)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 50
-   **Components:** V, S, X P
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Effect:** One summoned creature
-   **Duration:** 20 rounds
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 450,000 gp; 9 days; 18,000 XP. Seed: *summon* (DC
    14). Factors: summon CR 31 creature (+58 DC), allow creature to
    possess body and act at its own discretion (ad hoc --20 DC),
    1-action casting time (+20 DC). Mitigating factors: 12d6 backlash
    (--12 DC), burn 1,000 XP (--10 DC).

The character is possessed by a dream larva. For 20 rounds, the dream
larva's body physically replaces the character's, though the dream larva
has the character's equipment. The dream larva is free to call on all
its own powers and abilities, or use the character's equipment. The
character's consciousness and physical form are suppressed for the
duration of the possession. The character has no way to dismiss the
spell, communicate, or otherwise maintain awareness once possession has
commenced. The dream larva, temporarily freed from its imprisonment in
some distant nightmare, will attempt to slay and incapacitate any
creature it can see or find, whether it is a friend or foe of the
caster. Casting *lord of nightmares* entails some risk for the caster,
since it's unknown what a dream larva might do over the course of 20
rounds. The larva will dispatch all enemies it can find before turning
to its own concerns. Sometimes a dream larva will attempt to place
itself in a dangerous or precarious situation prior to the end of the
spell, leaving the caster to extricate him or herself. If the dream
larva is slain during the duration of the spell, the character's
consciousness is instantly restored to aware-ness within his or her own
body. The character's condition remains what it was when he or she
completed casting *lord of nightmares,*regardless of what damage the
dream larva received. However, magic item charges used, potions
consumed, and other physical resources used up by the dream larva are
permanent.

*XP Cost:* 1,000 XP.

## Mass Frog

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 55
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Area:** 40-ft.-radius hemisphere
-   **Duration:** Permanent
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 495,000 gp; 10 days; 19,800 XP. Seed: *transform*
    (DC 21). Factors: change target to area of 20-ft. hemisphere (+10
    DC), increase area by 100% (+4 DC), 1 action casting time (+20 DC).

This epic spell turns all Medium or smaller creatures in the area into
frogs. The transformed creatures retain their mental faculties,
including personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level
and class, hit points (despite any change in Consitution score),
alignment, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, extraordinary
abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not supernatural
abilities. They assume the physical characteristics of frogs, including
natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. (Use the
statistics for the toad.) All the creatures' equipment drops to the
ground upon transformation.

## Momento Mori

-   Necromancy \[Death\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 86

-   **Target:** One living creature
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 774,000 gp; 16 days; 30,960 XP. Seed: *slay* (DC
    25). Factor: increase to 160 HD (+8 DC), quickened (+28 DC), no
    verbal or somatic components (+4 DC), +10 to DC of subject's save
    (+20 DC).

As a free action that counts as a quickened spell, the character wills
the target dead without a word or gesture. The character's thought
snuffs out the life force of a living creature of 160 or fewer HD,
killing it instantly. The subject is entitled to a Fortitude saving
throw (DC 30 + relevant ability modifier) to have a chance of surviving
the attack. If the save is successful, the target instead takes 3d6+20
points of damage.

## Mummy Dust

with casting *mummy dust,*two Large 18-HD mummies (see below) spring up
from the dust in an area adjacent to the character. The mummies follow
the character's every command according to their abilities, until they
are destroyed or the character loses control of them by attempting to
control more Hit Dice of undead than he or she has caster levels.

*Material Component:* Specially prepared mummy dust (10,000 gp).

*XP Cost:* 2,000 XP.

save (DC 21), or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not
the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that
mummy's despair ability for one day. Mummy Rot (Su): Supernatural
disease---slam, Fortitude save (DC 21), incubation period 1 minute;
damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. The save DC is Charisma-based. Unlike normal
diseases, mummy rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0
(and dies) or is cured as described below. Mummy rot is a powerful
curse, not a natural disease. A character attempting to cast any
conjuration (healing) spell on a creature afflicted with mummy rot must
succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the
afflicted character. To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be
broken with *break enchantment* or *remove curse* (requiring a DC 20
caster level check for either spell), after which a caster level check
is no longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the
mummy rot can be magically cured as any normal disease.

An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand and
dust that blow away into nothing at the first wind.

## Nailed to the Sky

-   Conjuration \[Teleportation\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 62
-   **Components:** V, S ,XP
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** Creature or object weighing up to 1,000 lb.
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 558,000 gp; 12 days; 22,320 XP. Seeds: *foresee* (to
    preview endpoint of teleportation) (DC 17), *transport* (DC 27).
    Factors: unwilling target (+4 DC), increase range from touch (+4
    DC), 1-action casting time (+20 DC). Mitigating factor: burn 1,000
    XP (--10 DC).

*Nailed to the sky* actually places the target so far from the surface
of the world and at such a speed that it keeps missing the surface as it
falls back, so it enters an eternal orbit. Unless the target can
magically fly or has some other form of non-physical propulsion
available, the target is stuck until someone else rescues it. Even if
the target can fly, the surface is 2 to 4 hours away, assuming a *fly*
spell, which allows a maximum speed of 720 feet per round while
descending. The target may not survive that long. Depending on the world
where *nailed to the sky* is cast, conditions so far from its surface
may be deadly. Deleterious effects include scorching heat, cold, and
vacuum. Targets subject to these conditions take 2d6 points of damage
each from heat or cold and 1d4 points of damage from the vacuum each
round. The target immediately begins to suffocate.

*XP Cost:* 1,000 XP.

## Origin of Species: Achaierai

-   Conjuration (Creation, Healing)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 38
-   **Components:** V, S, DF, XP
-   **Casting Time:** 100 days, 11 minutes
-   **Range:** 0 ft.
-   **Effect:** One constructed creature up to Medium (20 cu. ft.)
-   **Duration:** Permanent
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 360,000 gp; 8 days; 14,400 XP. Seeds: conjure (DC
    21), life (DC 27), fortify (DC 17). Factors: +4 HD (5 hp per HD)
    (+20 DC), +6 to natural AC (+12 DC), add three more natural attacks
    (ad hoc +6 DC), add black cloud spell-like ability (+33 DC), add SR
    19 (+15 DC), permanent (x5 DC). Mitigating factors: 50d6 backlash
    (--50 DC), increase casting time by 10 minutes (--20 DC), increase
    casting time by 100 days (--200 DC), burn 10,000 XP (--100 DC),
    eleven additional casters contributing 9th-level spell slots (--187
    DC), ten additional casters contributing 8th-level spell slots
    (--150 DC), ten additional casters contributing 1st-level spell
    slots (--10 DC).

This spell creates a new creature: an achaierai. When first created, the
achaierai is Medium, but it grows to Large size in 1d4 days. A created
achaierai does not possess the treasure, culture, or specific knowledge
of a normal achaierai. If released to be among its own kind, it quickly
picks up achaierai traits and alignment.

*XP Cost:* 10,000 XP.

## Peripety

-   Abjuration
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 27
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 12 hours
-   **To Develop:** 243,000 gp; 5 days; 9,720 XP. Seed: *reflect* (DC
    27).

Ranged attacks targeted against the character rebound on the original
attacker. Any time during the duration, five attacks are automatically
reflected back on the original attacker; the character decides which
attacks before damage is rolled. The reflected attack rebounds on the
attacker using the same attack roll. Once five attacks are so reflected,
the spell ends.

## Pestilence

-   Conjuration, Necromancy
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 104
-   **Components:** V, S, Ritual, XP
-   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** 0 ft.
-   **Area:** 1,000-ft.-radius hemisphere
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 936,000 gp; 19 days; 37,440 XP. Seed: afflict (DC
    19). Factors: additional target type (plants) (+10 DC). change
    target to area (+10 DC), change 20-ft. radius to 1,000-ft. radius
    (+200 DC), disease effects (as per contagion spell) (ad hoc +21 DC).
    Mitigating factors: casting time increased by 9 minutes (--18 DC),
    two additional casters contributing epic spell slots (--38 DC), burn
    10,000 XP (--100 DC).

When *pestilence* is successfully cast, a wave of illness radites
outward from the site of the ritual, instantly infecting every living
thing in the area with the debilitating disease known as slimy doom.
Within 24 hours, everything in the area begins to show signs of rot and
decay.

Each day that a victim fails a Fortitude save, it takes 1d4 points of
temporary Constitution damage. If the victim then fails a second save, 1
point of that damage is permanent drain. If the victim succeeds at the
first saving throw of the day on consecutive days, he or she has
recovered from the disease. This magical form of the disease is not
contagious and will not spread beyond those initially infected. Fruits
and vegetables infected with slimy doom are unfit for consumption, as
are disease-ridden livestock. This is a ritual spell requiring two other
spellcasters, each of whom must expend an unused epic spell slot for the
casting. The primary caster must also burn 10,000 XP.

*XP Cost:* 10,000 XP.

## Rain of Fire

-   Evocation \[Fire\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 50
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 0 ft.
-   **Area:** 2-mile-radius emanation
-   **Duration:** 20 hours
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 450,000 gp; 9 days; 18,000 XP. Seeds: *energy
    (fire)* (DC 19), *energy (weather)* (DC 19). Factor: change rain to
    wisps of flame (ad hoc +12 DC).

This spell summons a swirling thunderstorm that rains fire rather than
raindrops down on the character and everything within a two-mile radius
of him or her. Everything caught unprotected or unsheltered in the
flaming deluge takes 1 point of fire damage each round. A successful
Reflex save results in no damage, but the save must be repeated each
round. Unless the ground is exceedingly damp, all vegetation is
eventually blackened and destroyed, leaving behind a barren wasteland
similar to the aftermath of a grass or forest fire. The fiery storm is
stationary and persists even if the caster leaves.

## Raise Island

-   Conjuration (Creation)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 38
-   **Components:** V, S, XP, Ritual
-   **Casting Time:** 65 days, 11 minutes
-   **Range:** 0 ft.
-   **Area:** 100-ft.-radius hemispherical island
-   **Duration:** Permanent
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 360,000 gp; 8 days; 14,400 XP. Seed: conjure (DC
    21). Factors: change area to 10-ft. radius, 30-ft. high cylinder (+2
    DC), change radius to 100 ft. (+40 DC), change height to 1,000 feet
    (+133 DC), permanent (x5 DC). Mitigating factors: increase casting
    time by 10 minutes (--20 DC), increase casting time by 65 days
    (--130 DC), nineteen additional casters contributing epic spell
    slots (--361 DC), one additional caster contributing one 6th-level
    spell slot (--11 DC), burn 2,000 XP per epic caster (--400 DC),
    spell only works on liquid (ad hoc --20 DC).

The character can literally raise a new island from out of the sea,
bringing to the surface a sandy or rocky but otherwise barren protrusion
that is solid, stable, and permanently established. The island is
roughly circular and about 200 feet in diameter. *Raise island* only
works if the ocean is less than 1,000 feet deep where the spell is cast.

*XP Cost:* 2,000 XP.

## Ruin

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 27
-   **Components:** V, S, X P
-   **Casting Time:** 1 full round
-   **Range:** 12,000 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature, or up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving
    matter
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 243,000 gp; 5 days; 9,720 XP. Seed: *destroy* (DC
    29). Factor: reduce casting time by 9 rounds (+18 DC). Mitigating
    factor: burn 2,000 XP (--20 DC).

The character deals 20d6 points of damage to a single target within
range and line of sight. If the target is reduced to --10 hit points or
less (or a construct, object, or undead is reduced to 0 hit points), it
is utterly destroyed as if disintegrated. Only a trace of fine dust
remains.

*XP Cost:* 2,000 XP.

## Safe Time

-   Conjuration \[Teleportation\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 64
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** You or creature touched
-   **Duration:** Contingent until expended, then 1 round of safe time
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 576,000 gp; 12 days; 23,040 XP. Seed: *transport*
    (DC 27). Factors: move to time stream (+8 DC), reduce static time to
    1 round (ad hoc +4 DC), activates when you would otherwise take 50
    or more points of damage (+25 DC).

*Safe time* can move the character (or the target) out of harm's way by
shunting him or her into a static time stream. Once cast, the spell
remains quiescent and does not activate until the trigger conditions
have been met. Each day it remains untriggered, it uses up an epic spell
slot, even if you cast it on another creature. Once triggered, the spell
is expended normally. When the character would otherwise be subject to
any instantaneous effect that would deal him or her 50 or more points of
damage, he or she is instead transported to a static time stream where
time ceases to flow. The character's condition becomes fixed---no force
or effect can harm him or her until 1 round of real time has passed.
Thus, the character avoids the damage he or she would otherwise receive,
but the character also misses out on one round of activity. To the
character, no time passes at all, but to onlookers who are part of real
time, the character stands frozen and fixed in space for 1 full round.

## Soul Dominion

-   Divination, Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 72
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** See text
-   **Target:** One other living creature
-   **Duration:** 20 minutes (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 648,000 gp; 13 days; 25,920 XP. Seeds: *contact* (DC
    23), *reveal* (DC 19), *compel* (DC 19). Factors: apply to all five
    senses (+8 DC), total compulsory control (+10 DC), stricter
    compulsion of any creature (ad hoc +11 DC). Mitigating factor:
    increase casting time by 9 minutes (--18 DC).

When a character casts this spell, he or she is temporarily able to take
control of another sentient creature with whom the character is familiar
(by meeting, observing, or successfully scrying the subject). The target
receives a Will save, and if successful, prevents the character from
making the telepathic connection. The target is aware of the attempted
takeover as a strange, momentary tingling. If the Will save fails, the
character is able to control the subject's body as if it were his or her
own, hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling, and tasting everything the
target senses. Once the character dismisses the spell or its duration
ends, the target resumes control of its body, fully aware of all events
that occurred, having been a helpless witness trapped inside its own
body. The target knows the name and general nature of its possessor if
it succeeds at an additional Will saving throw. A character cannot
control undead or incorporeal creatures with *soul dominion.*

## Soul Scry

-   Divination
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 55
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** See text
-   **Target:** One other living creature
-   **Duration:** 20 minutes (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 495,000 gp; 10 days; 19,800 XP. Seeds: *contact* (DC
    23), *reveal* (DC 19), *conceal* (DC 17). Factors: apply to all five
    senses (+8 DC), conceal detection (ad hoc +6 DC). Mitigating factor:
    increase casting time by 9 minutes (--18 DC).

When a character casts this spell, he or she is temporarily able to tap
the consciousness of another sentient creature with whom the character
is familiar (by meeting, observing, or successfully scrying the
subject), experiencing everything he or she does with all five senses.
The target receives a Will save, and if successful, prevents the
character from making the telepathic connection. Whether the saving
throw is successful or not, the target is unaware of the attempted
intrusion. Once the subject is tapped, the character is able to hear,
see, feel, smell, and taste everything the subject senses. The character
cannot control the subject, however. The character can only see what the
subject chooses to look at, and the character tastes something only if
the subject eats or drinks it during the spell's duration. During this
time, the character's own body remains in a trance-like state. If the
subject takes damage, the character senses the injuries, although his or
her own body does not actually suffer any ill effects. If the subject is
knocked unconscious or killed, the spell immediately ends.

## Spell Worm

-   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 45
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Target:** One living creature
-   **Duration:** 20 hours or until completed
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 405,000 gp; 9 days; 16,200 XP. Seed: *compel* (DC
    19). Factors: unobtrusive (ad hoc +6 DC), 1-action casting time (+20
    DC).

On a failed save, the subject must spend a standard action each round
abandoning his or her highest-level spell (or losing his or her
highest-level unused spell slot). Each round, the subject eliminates
another spell or spell slot, moving to lower-level spells once all the
higher-level spells are gone. In the case of prepared spells, the
subject decides which spells to abandon at each level. If the subject
has more than one standard action allowed in the round, he or she may
spend those actions as he or she desires. The subject doesn't realize
the spells or spell slots are gone until he or she tries to cast a spell
and finds it unavailable. Abandoning a spell slot or losing a spell is
standard action, but it does not draw an attack of opportunity. It is a
purely mental exercise not obvious to observers.

## Summon Behemoth

-   Conjuration (Summoning)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 72
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Effect:** Summoned creature
-   **Duration:** 20 rounds (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 648,000 gp; 13 days; 25,920 XP. Seed: *summon* (DC
    14). Factors: summon CR 21 creature (DC +38), 1-action casting time
    (+20 DC).

The character can summon a behemoth to attack his or her enemies. It
appears where the character designates and acts immediately, on the
character's turn. It attacks the character's opponents to the best of
its ability. If the character can communicate with the creature, he or
she can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to
perform other actions. Summoned creatures act normally on the last round
of the spell and disappear at the end of their turn.

## Superb Dispelling

-   Abjuration
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 59
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature or object
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 531,000 gp; 11 days; 21,240 XP. Seed: *dispel* (DC
    19). Factors: additional +30 to dispel check (+30 DC), 1-action
    casting time (+20 DC). Mitigating factor: 10d6 backlash (--10 DC).

As *greater dispel magic*, except that the maximum bonus on the dispel
check is +40, and the character takes 10d6 points of backlash damage.

## Time Duplicate

-   Conjuration \[Teleportation\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 71
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 free action
-   **Effect:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 round (see text)
-   **Saving Throw:** None (harmless)
-   **Spell Resistance:** None (harmless)
-   **To Develop:** 639,000 gp; 13 days; 25,560 XP. Seed: *transport*
    (to move future you back in time 1 round) (DC 27). Factors: move to
    time stream (+8 DC), stretch the base temporal effect (ad hoc +8
    DC), quickened (+28 DC).

The character snatches him or her self from 1 round in the future,
depositing this future self in an adjacent space as a free action that
counts as a quickened spell. The character's future self is technically
only a possible future self (the time stream is a maelstrom of multiple
probabilities), but snatching that future self from 1 round in the
future collapses probability, and the possible future becomes the
definite future. The character and his or her future self are both free
to act normally this round (the character has already used up the limit
of one quickened spell per round, but his or her duplicate hasn't). The
future self has all the resources the character has at the moment he or
she finishes casting *time duplicate.*Because the future self was
previously only a possibility, his or her resources are not depleted as
a result of whatever might occur this round (even if the character dies
this round). Likewise, he or she doesn't have any special knowledge of
what might occur during this round. Because the future self is still
part of the time stream, the round it spends with the character is a
round it misses in its own future. Because the chracter's future
duplicate is also the character, the character misses the next round as
well. He or she simply isn't there. Tampering with the time stream is a
tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary.

*Round One:* The character casts *time duplicate,*the future self from
round two arrives, and both act normally.

*Round Two:* The future self---the character---gets snatched back in
time to help the past self. During this round, there are no versions of
the character present.

*Round Three:* The character rejoins the time stream. The character
arrives in the same location and condition that the future self ended
with at the end of the first round. Any resources (spells, damage, staff
charges) the future self used up in round one are gone for real. Record
them now. Using this spell to snatch a single future self stretches time
and probability to its limit; more powerful versions of *time duplicate*
are not possible. A character cannot bring more than a single future
version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character snatch
a version of him or her from farther in the future.

## Vengeful Gaze of God

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 419
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 12,000 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature, or up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving
    matter in line of sight
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
-   **To Develop:** 3,771,000 gp; 76 days; 150,840 XP. Seed: *destroy*
    (DC 29). Factor: increase damage to 305d6 (+570 DC), 1-action
    casting time (+20 DC). Mitigating factor: 200d6 backlash (--200 DC).

The target of this spell is subject to 305d6 points of damage (or half
of that if a Fortitude save succeeds). If the target is reduced to --10
hit points or less (or a construct, object, or undead is reduced to 0
hit points), it is utterly destroyed as if disintegrated, leaving behind
only a trace of fine dust. The caster is likewise dealt 200d6 points of
damage

## Verdigris

-   Conjuration (Creation)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 58
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Area:** 100-ft.-radius hemisphere
-   **Duration:** 24 hours
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 522,000 gp; 11 days; 20,880 XP. Seed: *conjure* (DC
    21). Factors: change area to 20-ft. radius hemisphere (+2 DC),
    increase radius to 100 ft. (+16 DC), deal 10d6 damage during growth
    (ad hoc +19 DC).

This spell creates a tsunami of grass, shrubs, and trees that overgrows
the area like a tidal wave. The plant growth creeps and curls across
every-thing in the area, ensnaring it and coiling around it as if it had
been growing there for a century or more. Creatures in the area must
make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the fast-moving growth, which
otherwise deals 10d6 points of damage from the crushing press. Buildings
are engulfed and they likewise take 10d6 points of damage. Those
destroyed by the damage have their foundations uprooted and walls
crumbled. The plant growth remains for 24 hours, after which it
vanishes.

## Verdigris Tsunami

-   Conjuration (Creation)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 170
-   **Components:** V, S, Ritual, XP
-   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** 1,500 ft.
-   **Area:** 1,000-ft.-radius hemisphere
-   **Duration:** Permanent
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
-   **Spell Resistance:** No
-   **To Develop:** 1,530,000 gp; 31 days; 61,200 XP. Seed: conjure (DC
    21). Factor: change area to 20-ft.-radius hemisphere (+2 DC),
    increase radius to 1,000 ft. (+196 DC), increase range to 1,500 ft.
    (+8 DC), deal 10d6 damage during growth (ad hoc +19 DC), increase
    damage to 40d6 (+60 DC), permanent (x5 DC). Mitigating factors:
    increase casting time by 9 minutes (--18 DC), eleven additional
    casters contributing 6th-level spell slots (--121 DC), three
    additional casters contributing 4th-level spell slots (--21 DC),
    burn 10,000 XP per 6th-level spell contributor plus caster (--1,200
    DC).

This spell creates a tsunami of grass, shrubs, and trees that overgrows
the area like a tidal wave. The plant growth creeps and curls across
every-thing in the area, ensnaring it and coiling around it as if it had
been growing there for a century or more. Creatures in the area must
make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the fast-moving growth, which
otherwise deals 40d6 points of damage from the crushing press. Buildings
are engulfed and they likewise take 40d6 points of damage. Those
destroyed by the damage have their foundations uprooted and walls
crumbled. The plant growth is permanent. This is a ritual spell
requiring fourteen other spellcasters, each of whom must contribute an
unused 6th-level spell slot to the casting.

*XP Cost:* 10,000 XP.

## Developing Epic Spells

An epic spell is developed from smaller pieces called seeds and
connecting pieces called factors. Every epic seed has a base Spellcraft
DC, and every factor has a Spell-craft DC adjustment. When a desired
spell is developed, the spellcaster spends resources and time to
assemble the pieces that make up the epic spell. The base Spellcraft DCs
of each seed are added together; then the DC adjustments of the factors
are added to that total. The sum equals the final Spellcraft DC for the
epic spell.

The final Spellcraft DC is the most significant gauge of the epic
spell's power. A spellcaster attempts to cast an epic spell by making a
Spellcraft check against the epic spell's Spellcraft DC. Thus, a
spellcaster knows immediately, based on his or her own Spellcraft bonus,
what epic spells are within his or her capability to cast, which are
risky, and which are beyond him or her. Epic casters don't commit time
and money to develop epic spells until they are powerful enough to cast
them.

An epic spell developed by an arcane spellcaster is arcane, and an epic
spell developed by a divine spellcaster is divine. A character who can
cast both divine and arcane epic spells chooses whether a particular
spell he or she develops will be arcane or divine. If that same caster
uses the *heal* or *life* seed in an epic spell, that spell is always
considered divine. All the epic spells described here can be developed
independently by a character who spends the necessary time, money, and
experience points. Alternatively, a character can use those spells as a
starting point when creating customized versions of the spells.

  : Table: Epic Seeds

\*Spellcasters without at least 24 ranks in Knowledge (religion) or
Knowledge (nature) may not use *heal* or *life* spell seeds.

**Resource Cost:** The development of an epic spell uses up raw
materials costing a number of gold pieces equal to 9,000 xthe final
Spellcraft DC of the epic spell being developed.

**Development Time:** Developing an epic spell takes one day for each
50,000 gp in resources required to develop the spell, rounded up to
whole days.

**XP Cost:** To develop an epic spell, a character must spend 1/25 of
its resource price in experience points.

**Adding Seed DCs:** When two or more epic seeds are combined in an epic
spell, their base Spellcraft DCs are added together. Both contribute
toward the spell's final Spellcraft DC.

**Determining School:** When combining two or more seeds to develop an
epic spell, the school of the finished spell is decided by the caster
from among the seeds that make up the epic spell.

**Combining Descriptors:** When two or more epic seeds are combined in
an epic spell, all the descriptors from each seed apply to the finished
spell.

**Combining Components and Casting Times:** Almost every epic spell has
verbal and somatic components and a 1-minute casting time, regardless of
the number of epic seeds combined. The only exceptions are epic spells
with the *heal* and *life* seeds, which have divine focus components.

**Combining Range, Targets, Area, and Effect:** One seed might have a
range of 12,000 feet, another seed might have a range of 400 feet, and a
third seed might not have a range at all. Likewise, some seeds have
targets, while others have an effect or an area. To determine which seed
takes precedence in the finished epic spell, the character must decide
which seed is the base seed. The seed most important to the spell's
overall purpose is the base seed, and it determines the casting time,
range, target, and so on. The other seeds apply only their specific
effects to the finished spell. It is occasionally difficult to determine
a base seed by examining the spell's effects. If no one seed is most
important, simply pick one seed for the purposes of making this
determination.

**Combining Durations:** When combining two or more seeds to develop an
epic spell, the seed with the shortest duration determines the duration
of the finished epic spell. If any seed of an epic spell is dismissible
by the caster, the epic spell is dismissible.

**Saving Throws:** Even if more than one seed has an associated saving
throw, the final spell will have only a single saving throw. If two or
more seeds have the same kind of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or
Will), then obviously that will be used for the spell's saving throw. If
the seeds have different kinds of saving throws, simply choose the
saving throw that seems most appropriate for the final spell.

**Spell Resistance:** When combining two or more seeds to develop an
epic spell, if even one seed is subject to spell resistance, the
finished epic spell is subject to it as well.

**Factors:** Factors are not part of epic seeds, but they are the tools
used to modify specific parameters of any given seed. Applying factors
to the seeds of an epic spell can increase or decrease the final
Spellcraft DC, increase the duration, change the area of a spell, and
affect many other aspects of the spell.

There are three kinds of factors:

1\. Those that can affect a number of seeds.

2\. Those that can only be used with specific seeds.

3\. Those that reduce the Spellcraft DC rather than increasing it. These
are referred to as mitigating factors. To calculate the final Spellcraft
DC of an epic spell correctly, it's important to determine the
mitigating factors last, after all the factors that increase the DC have
been accounted for.

**Development Is an Art:** Many times developing a completely new epic
spell requires some guesswork and rule stretching. As with making and
pricing magic items, a sort of balancing act is required. Often the
description of a seed will need to be stretched for a particular spell.
If necessary, assess an "ad hoc" Spellcraft DC adjustment for any effect
that cannot be extrapolated from the seeds and factors presented
here---the example spells use ad hoc factors frequently. In all cases,
the GM determines the actual Spellcraft DC of the new spell

**Approval:** This is the final step, and it's critically important. The
epic spell development work and reasoning must be shown to the GM and
receive his or her approval. If the GM doesn't approve, then the epic
spell cannot be developed. However, the GM should explain why the epic
spell wasn't approved and possibly offer suggestions on how to create an
epic spell that will be acceptable.

  : Table: Epic Spell Factors

Unless stated otherwise, the same factor can be applied more than once.

1 Each contingent spell in use counts as a slot used from the caster's
daily epic spell slots.

2 Seeds that already have an instantaneous or permanent duration cannot
be increased.

3 When changing a targeted or area seed to a touch or ranged attack, the
seed no longer requires a save if it deals damage, instead requiring a
successful attack roll. Seeds with a nondamaging effect still allow the
target a save. Area spells changed to touch or ranged attacks now affect
only the creature successfully attacked.

4 When changing a touch or ranged attack seed to a targeted seed, the
seed no longer requires an attack roll if it deals damage, instead
requiring a saving throw from the target. On a failed saving throw, the
target takes half damage. Area seeds changed to targeted seeds now only
affect the target. The GM determines the most appropriate kind of saving
throw for the epic spell.

5 Epic spells may only be inscribed on stone tablets or other substances
of equal or greater hardness. Once a spell is so inscribed, another epic
spellcaster can learn it without going through the process of
development. Once an inscribed epic spell is learned by another epic
spellcaster in this fashion, the tablet upon which it is inscribed is
destroyed and cannot be mended.

  ------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------

  : Table: Epic Spell Mitigating Factors

Note: Mitigating factors are always applied after all epic spell factors
(see above) are accounted for in the development of an epic spell.

1 The caster cannot somehow avoid or make him or her self immune to
backlash damage. For spells with durations longer than instantaneous,
the backlash damage is per round. If backlash damage kills a caster, no
spell or method exists that will return life to the caster's body
without costing the caster a level---not even *wish, true resurrection,
miracle,* or epic spells that return life to the deceased. Spells that
normally penalize the recipient one level when they return him or her to
life penalize a caster killed by backlash two levels.

2 When increasing the casting time of a spell in order to reduce the
Spellcraft DC, a character must first "use up" the maximum of 10 minutes
(for a total DC modifier of --20). After that, a character can continue
to add days to the casting time, with a further modifier of --2 per day,
up to the maximum of 100 days.

**Additional Participants:** Epic spells can be developed that
specifically require additional participants. These spells are called
rituals. An epic spell developed as a ritual requires a specific number
of additional participants, who each must use up one spell slot of a
specified level for the day. During an epic spell's development, the
spell's creator determines the number of additional participants and the
level of the spell slots to be contributed. If the exact number of
spellcasters does not partake in the casting, or if the casters do not
each contribute the proper spell slot, the epic spell automatically
fails. To participate, each participant readies an action to contribute
his or her raw spell energy when the primary caster begins the epic
spell. Additional participants in a ritual spell reduce the Spellcraft
DC, as shown on Table: Additional Participants in Rituals. Each
additional participant may only contribute one spell slot. It doesn't
matter whether the additional participants are arcane or divine
spellcasters; only the level of the spell slot contributed matters. A
contributed spell slot is treated as if normally cast. A wizard may
contribute either a prepared, uncast spell slot, or an open, unprepared
slot. The Spellcraft DC adjustments for each additional participant
stack.

*Special:* A ritual epic spell that takes longer than 1 standard action
to cast requires all extra participants to stand as if casting for the
same amount of time. If an extra participant is attacked while
contributing a spell slot, the participant must make a Concentration
check as if casting a spell of the same level as the slot contributed.
If the attack disrupts the participant in the ritual, the epic spell is
not necessarily ruined. However, the Spellcraft DC reduction that would
have been provided by that additional participant cannot be applied to
the final Spellcraft DC of the epic spell. Thus the ritual epic spell
will be harder for the primary spellcaster to cast.

## Seed Descriptions

Each seed description hereafter follows the same format used for 0- to
9th-level spells. An additional line, Spellcraft DC, indicates the base
DC of the Spellcraft check required to cast an epic spell with this
seed.

### Seed:Afflict {#seed-afflict}

-   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Fear, Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 14
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** One living creature
-   **Duration:** 20 minutes
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Afflicts the target with a --2 morale penalty on attack rolls, checks,
and saving throws. For each additional --1 penalty assessed on either
the target's attack rolls, checks, or saving throws, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2. A character may also develop a spell with this seed
that afflicts the target with a --1 penalty on caster level checks, a
--1 penalty to an ability score, a --1 penalty to spell resistance, or a
--1 penalty to some other aspect of the target. For each additional --1
penalty assessed in one of the above categories, increase the
Spell-craft DC by +4. This seed can afflict a character's ability scores
to the point where they reach 0, except for Constitution where 1 is the
minimum. If a factor is applied to increase the duration of this seed,
ability score penalties instead become temporary ability damage. If a
factor is applied to make the duration permanent, any ability score
penalties become permanent ability drain. Finally, by increasing the
Spellcraft DC by +2, one of the target's senses can be afflicted: sight,
smell, hearing, taste, touch, or a special sense the target possesses.
If the target fails its saving throw, the sense selected doesn't
function for the spell's duration, with all attendant penalties that
apply for losing the specified sense.

### Seed:Animate {#seed-animate}

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 25
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** Object or 20 cu. ft. of matter
-   **Duration:** 20 rounds
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

This seed can imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of
life (not actual life). The animated object attacks whomever or whatever
the caster initially designates. The animated object can be of any
nonmagical material. The caster can also animate part of a larger mass
of raw matter, such as a volume of water in the ocean, part of a stony
wall, or the earth itself, as long as the volume of material does not
exceed 20 cubic feet. For each additional 10 cubic feet of matter
animated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1, up to 1,000 cubic feet. For
each additional 100 cubic feet of matter animated after the first 1,000
cubic feet, increase the spellcraft DC by +1. For each additional Hit
Die granted to an animated object of a given size, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2. To animate attended objects (objects carried or
worn by another creature), increase the Spellcraft DC by +10.

### Seed:Animate Dead {#seed-animate-dead}

-   Necromancy \[Evil\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 23
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** One or more corpses touched
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

The caster can turn the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead
that follow his or her spoken commands. The undead can follow the
caster, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or a
specific type of creature) entering the place. The undead remain
animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed undead can't be animated
again.) Intelligent undead can follow more sophisticated commands. The
*animate dead* seed allows a character to create 20 HD of undead. For
each additional 1 HD of undead created, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+1. The undead created remain under the caster's control indefinitely. A
caster can naturally control 1 HD per caster level of undead creatures
he or she has personally created, regardless of the method used. If the
caster exceeds this number, newly created creatures fall under his or
her control, and excess undead from previous castings become
uncontrolled (the caster chooses which creatures are released). If the
caster is a cleric, any undead he or she commands through his or her
ability to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit. For
each additional 2 HD of undead to be controlled, increase the Spellcraft
DC by +1. Only undead in excess of 20 HD created with this seed can be
controlled using this DC adjustment. To both create and control more
than 20 HD of undead, increase the Spellcraft DC by +3 per additional 2
HD of undead.

Type of Undead: All types of undead can be created with the *animate
dead* seed, although creating more powerful undead increases the
Spellcraft DC of the epic spell, according to the table below. The GM
must set the Spellcraft DC for undead not included on the table, using
similar undead as a basis for comparison.

  ---------- ------------------------ --------- ------------------------
  Undead     Spellcraft DC Modifier   Undead    Spellcraft DC Modifier
  Skeleton   --12                     Wraith    --2
  Zombie     --12                     Mummy     +0
  Ghoul      --10                     Spectre   +2
  Shadow     --8                      Morhg     +4

  Wight      --4                      Ghost     +8
  ---------- ------------------------ --------- ------------------------

### Seed: Armor

-   Conjuration (Creation) \[Force\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 14
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** 24 hours (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

This seed grants a creature additional armor, providing a +4 bonus to
Armor Class. The bonus is either an armor bonus or a natural armor
bonus, whichever the caster selects. Unlike mundane armor, the *armor*
seed provides an intangible protection that entails no armor check
penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Incorporeal
creatures can't bypass the *armor* seed the way they can ignore normal
armor. For each additional point of Armor Class bonus, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster can also grant a creature a +1 bonus to
Armor Class using a different bonus type, such as deflection, divine, or
insight. For each additional point of bonus to Armor Class of one of
these types, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10.

### Seed: Banish

-   Abjuration
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 27
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Target:** One or more extraplanar creatures, no two of which can
    be more than 30 ft. apart
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This seed forces extraplanar creatures out of the caster's home plane.
The caster can banish up to 14 HD of extraplanar creatures. For each
additional 2 HD of extraplanar creatures banished, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +1. To specify a type or sub-type of creature other
than outsider to be banished, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20.

### Seed: Compel

-   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 19
-   **Components:** V, M
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Target:** One living creature
-   **Duration:** 20 hours or until completed
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This seed compels a target to follow a course of activity. At the basic
level of effect, a spell using the *compel* seed must be worded in such
a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature
to do an obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect (unless
the Spellcraft DC has been increased to avoid this limitation; see
below). To compel a creature to follow an outright unreasonable course
of action, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. The compelled course of
activity can continue for the entire duration. If the compelled activity
can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject
finishes what he or she was asked to do. The caster can instead specify
conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If
the condition is not met before the spell using this seed expires, the
activity is not performed.

### Seed: Conceal

-   Illusion (Glamer)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 17
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Personal or touch
-   **Target:** You or a creature or object of up to 2,000 lb.
-   **Duration:** 200 minutes or until expended (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates (harmless, object)
-   **Spell Resistance:** No or Yes (harmless, object)

This seed can conceal a creature or object touched from sight, even from
darkvision. If the subject is a creature carrying gear, the gear
vanishes too, rendering the creature invisible. A spell using the
*conceal* seed ends if the subject attacks any creature. Actions
directed at unattended objects do not break the spell, and causing harm
indirectly is not an attack. To create invisibility that lasts
regardless of the actions of the subject, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+4. Alternatively, this seed can conceal the exact location of the
subject so that it appears to be about 2 feet away from its true
location; this increases the Spellcraft DC by +2. The subject benefits
from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. However, unlike
actual total concealment, this displacement effect does not prevent
enemies from targeting him or her normally. The *conceal* seed can also
be used to block divination spells, spell-like effects, and epic spells
developed using the *reveal* seed; this increases the Spellcraft DC by
+6. In all cases where divination magic of any level, including epic
level, is employed against the subject of a spell using the *conceal*
seed for this purpose, an opposed caster level check determines which
spell works.

### Seed: Conjure

-   Conjuration (Creation)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 21
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 0 ft.
-   **Effect:** Unattended, nonmagical object of nonliving matter up to
    20 cu. ft.
-   **Duration:** 8 hours
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

This seed creates a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving matter of
up to 20 cubic feet in volume. The caster must succeed at an appropriate
skill check to make a complex item. The seed can create matter ranging
in hardness and rarity from vegetable matter all the way up to mithral
and even adamantine. Simple objects have a natural duration of 24 hours.
For each additional cubic foot of matter created, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2. Attempting to use any created object as a material
component or a resource during epic spell development causes the spell
to fail and the object to disappear.

The *conjure* seed can be used in conjunction with the *life* and
*fortify* seeds for an epic spell that creates an entirely new creature,
if made permanent. To give a creature spell-like abilities, apply other
epic seeds to the epic spell that replicate the desired ability. To give
the creature a supernatural or extraordinary ability rather than a
spell-like ability, double the cost of the relevant seed. Remember that
two doublings equals a tripling, and so forth. To give a creature Hit
Dice, use the *fortify* seed. Each 5 hit points granted to the creature
gives it an additional 1 HD. Once successfully created, the new creature
will breed true.

### Seed: Contact

-   Divination
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 23
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** See text
-   **Target:** One creature
-   **Duration:** 200 minutes
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

This seed forges a telepathic bond with a particular creature with which
the caster is familiar (or one that the caster can currently see
directly or through magical means) and can converse back and forth. The
subject recognizes the caster if it knows him or her. It can answer in
like manner immediately, though it does not have to. The caster can
forge a communal bond among more than two creatures. For each additional
creature contacted, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. The bond can be
established only among willing subjects, which therefore receive no
saving throw or spell resistance. For telepathic communication through
the bond regardless of language, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. No
special influence is established as a result of the bond, only the power
to communicate at a distance.

At the base Spellcraft DC of 20, a caster can also use the *contact*
seed to imbue an object (or creature) with a message he or she prepares
that appears as written text for the spell's duration or is spoken aloud
in a language the caster knows. The spoken message can be of any length,
but the length of written text is limited to what can be contained (as
text of a readable size) on the surface of the target. The message is
delivered when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the
caster's desire when the spell is cast.

### Seed: Delude

-   Illusion (Figment)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 14
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 12,000 ft.
-   **Effect:** Visual figment that can extend for up to twenty 30-ft.
    cubes (S)
-   **Duration:** Concentration plus 20 hours
-   **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

A spell developed with the *delude* seed creates the visual illusion of
an object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster. The caster
can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect by
concentrating (the image is otherwise stationary). The image disappears
when struck by an opponent unless the caster causes the illusion to
react appropriately. For an illusion that includes audible, olfactory,
tactile, taste, and thermal aspects, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2
per extra aspect. Even realistic tactile and thermal illusions can't
deal damage, however. For each additional image to be created, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +1. For an illusion that follows a script
determined by the caster, increase the Spellcraft DC by +9. The figment
follows the script without the caster having to concentrate on it. The
illusion can include intelligible speech if desired. For an illusion
that makes any area appear to be something other than it is, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +4. Additional components, such as sounds, can be
added as noted above. Concealing creatures requires additional spell
development using this or other seeds.

### Seed: Destroy

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 29
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 12,000 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature, or up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving
    matter
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This seed deals 20d6 points of damage to the target. The damage is of no
particular type or energy. For each additional 1d6 points of damage
dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. If the target is reduced to
--10 hit points or less (or a construct, object, or undead is reduced to
0 hit points), it is utterly destroyed as if disintegrated, leaving
behind only a trace of fine dust. Up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving
matter is affected, so a spell using the *destroy* seed destroys only
part of any very large object or structure targeted. The *destroy* seed
affects even magical matter, energy fields, and force effects that are
normally only affected by the *disintegrate* spell. Such effects are
automatically destroyed. Epic spells using the *ward* seed may also be
destroyed, though the caster must succeed at an opposed caster level
check against the other spellcaster to bring down a *ward* spell.

### Seed: Dispel

-   Abjuration
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 19
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature, object, or spell
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

This seed can end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or
object, temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or
end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area. A
dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. The *dispel* seed
can defeat all spells, even those not normally subject to *dispel
magic.*The *dispel* seed can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing
effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells, and it affects
spell-like effects just as it affects spells. One creature, object, or
spell is the target of the *dispel* seed. The caster makes a dispel
check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in
effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 10 against a
DC of 11 + the target spell's caster level. For each additional +1 on
the dispel check, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. If targeting an
object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell, make a dispel
check to end the spell that affects the object or creature. If the
object targeted is a magic item, make a dispel check against the item's
caster level. If succeessful, all the item's magical properties are
suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A
suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An
interdimensional interface is temporarily closed. A magic item's
physical properties are unchanged. Any creature, object, or spell is
potentially subject to the *dispel* seed, even the spells of gods and
the abilities of artifacts. A character automatically succeeds on the
dispel check against any spell that he or she cast him or her self.

### Seed: Energy

-   Evocation \[Acid, Fire, Electricity, Cold, or Sonic\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 19
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 300 ft. or touched creature or object of 2,000 lb. or
    less
-   **Area:** A bolt 5 ft. wide to 300 ft. long; or a 10-ft.-radius
    emanation; or a wall whose area is up to one 200-ft. square; or a
    sphere or hemi-sphere with a radius of up to 20 ft.
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous or 20 hours (see text)
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This seed uses whichever one of five energy types the caster chooses:
acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The caster can cast the energy
forth as a bolt, imbue an object with the energy, or create a
freestanding manifestation of the energy. If the spell developed using
the *energy* seed releases a bolt, that bolt instantaneously deals 10d6
points of damage of the appropriate energy type, and all in the bolt's
area must make a Reflex save for half damage. For each additional 1d6
points of damage dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The bolt
begins at the caster's fingertips. To imbue another creature with the
ability to use an energy bolt as a spell-like ability at its option or
when a particular condition is met, increase the Spellcraft DC by +25.
The caster can also cause a creature or object to emanate the specific
energy type out to a radius of 10 feet for 20 hours. The emanated energy
deals 2d6 points of energy damage per round against unprotected
creatures (the target creature is susceptible if not separately warded
or otherwise resistant to the energy). For each additional 1d6 points of
damage emanated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster may also
create a wall, half-circle, circle, dome, or sphere of the desired
energy that emanates the energy for up to 20 hours. One side of the
wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of energy, dealing 2d4
points of energy damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of
energy damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals
this damage when it appears and in each round that a creature enters or
remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6+20 points of energy
damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage
to undead creatures. For each additional 1d4 points of damage, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +2.

The caster can also use the *energy* seed to create a spell that
carefully releases and balances the emanation of cold, electricity, and
fire, creating specific weather effects for a period of 20 hours. Using
the *energy* seed this way has a base Spellcraft DC of 25. The area
extends to a two-mile-radius centered on the caster. Once the spell is
cast, the weather takes 10 minutes to manifest. Ordinarily, a caster
can't directly target a creature or object, though indirect effects are
possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat waves, thunderstorms,
fogs, blizzards---even a tornado that moves randomly in the affected
area. Creating targeted damaging effects requires an additional use of
the *energy* seed.

### Seed: Foresee

-   Divination
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 17
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous or concentration (see text)

The caster can foretell the immediate future, or gain information about
specific questions. He or she is 90% likely to receive a meaningful
reading of the future of the next 30 minutes. If successful, the caster
knows if a particular action will bring good results, bad results, or no
result. For each additional 30 minutes into the future, multiply the
Spellcraft DC by x2. For better results, the caster can pose up to ten
specific questions (one per round while he or she concentrates) to
unknown powers of other planes, but the base Spellcraft DC for such an
attempt is 23. The answers return in a language the caster understands,
but use only one-word replies: "yes," "no," "maybe," "never,"
"irrelevant," or some other one-word answer. Unlike 0- to 9th-level
spells of similar type, all questions answered are 90% likely to be
answered truthfully. However, a specific spell using the *foresee* seed
can only be cast once every five weeks. The *foresee* seed is also
useful for epic spells requiring specific information before
functioning, such as spells using the *reveal* and *transport* seeds.
The *foresee* seed can also be used to gain one basic piece of
information about a living target: level, class, alignment, or some
special ability (or one of an object's magical abilities, if any). For
each additional piece of information revealed, increase the Spellcraft
DC by +2.

### Seed: Fortify

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 17 (see text)
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** 20 hours; permanent for age adjustment
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

Spells using the *fortify* seed grant a +1 enhancement bonus to
whichever one of the following the caster chooses:

-Any one ability score.

-Any one kind of saving throw.

-Spell resistance.

-Natural armor.

The *fortify* seed can also grant energy resistance 1 for one energy
type or 1 temporary hit point. For each additional +1 bonus, point of
energy resistance, or hit point, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.

The *fortify* seed has a base Spellcraft DC of 23 if it grants a +1
bonus of a type other than enhancement. For each additional +1 bonus of
a type other than enhancement, increase the Spellcraft DC by +6. If the
caster applies a factor to make the duration permanent, the bonus must
be an inherent bonus, and the maximum inherent bonus allowed is +5.

The *fortify* seed has a base Spellcraft DC of 27 if it grants a
creature a +1 bonus to an ability score or other statistic it does not
possess. For each additional +1 bonus, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4.
If a spell with the *fortify* seed grants an inanimate object an ability
score it would not normally possess (such as Intelligence), the spell
must also incorporate the *life* seed.

Granting spell resistance to a creature that doesn't already have it is
a special case; the base Spellcraft DC of 27 grants spell resistance 25,
and each additional point of spell resistance increases the Spellcraft
DC by +4 (each --1 to spell resistance reduces the Spellcraft DC by
--2).

The *fortify* seed can also grant damage reduction 1/magic. For each
additional point of damage reduction, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.
To increase the damage reduction value to epic, increase the Spellcraft
DC by +15.

A special use of the *fortify* seed grants the target a permanent +1
year to its current age category. For each additional +1 year added to
the creature's current age category, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.
Incremental adjustments to a creature's maximum age do not stack; they
overlap. When a spell increases a creature's current age category, all
higher age categories are also adjusted accordingly.

### Seed: Heal

-   Conjuration (Healing)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 25
-   **Components:** V, S, DF
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Yes (harmless; see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

Spells developed with the *heal* seed channel positive energy into a
creature to wipe away disease and injury. Such a spell completely cures
all diseases, blindness, deafness, hit point damage, and temporary
ability damage. To restore permanently drained ability score points,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +6. The *heal* seed neutralizes poisons in
the subject's system so that no additional damage or effects are
suffered. It offsets feeblemindedness and cures mental disorders caused
by spells or injury to the brain. It dispels all magical effects
penalizing the character's abilities, including effects caused by
spells, even epic spells developed with the *afflict* seed. Only a
single application of the spell is needed to simultaneously achieve all
these effects. This seed does not restore levels or Constitution points
lost due to death. To dispel all negative levels afflicting the target,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. This reverses level drains by a force
or creature. The drained levels are restored only if the creature lost
the levels within the last 20 weeks. For each additional week since the
levels were drained, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.

Against undead, the influx of positive energy causes the loss of all but
1d4 hit points if the undead fails a Fortitude saving throw.

An epic caster with 24 ranks in Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (nature),
or Knowledge (religion) can cast a spell developed with a special
version of the heal seed that flushes negative energy into the subject,
healing undead completely but causing the loss of all but 1d4 hit points
in living creatures if they fail a Fortitude saving throw.
Alternatively, a living target that fails its Fortitude saving throw
could gain four negative levels for the next 8 hours. For each
additional negative level bestowed, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4,
and for each extra hour the negative levels persist, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2. If the subject has at least as many negative levels
as Hit Dice, it dies. If the subject survives and the negative levels
persist for 24 hours or longer, the subject must make another Fortitude
saving throw, or the negative levels are converted to actual level loss.

### Seed: Life

-   Conjuration (Healing)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 27
-   **Components:** V, S, DF
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Dead creature touched
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

A spell developed with the *life* seed will restore life and complete
vigor to any deceased creature. The condition of the remains is not a
factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still
exists, it can be returned to life, but the portion receiving the spell
must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. (The
remains of a creature hit by a *disintegrate* spell count as a small
portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead for no longer than
two hundred years. For each additional ten years, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +1. The creature is immediately restored to full hit
points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the
subject loses one level (or 1 point of Constitution if the subject was
1st level). The life seed cannot revive someone who has died of old age.

An epic caster with 24 ranks in Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (nature),
or Knowledge (religion) can cast a spell developed with a special
version of the life seed that gives actual life to normally inanimate
objects. The caster can give inanimate plants and animals a soul,
personality, and humanlike sentience. To succeed, the caster must make a
Will save (DC 10 + the target's Hit Dice, or the Hit Dice a plant will
have once it comes to life).

The newly living object, intelligent animal, or sentient plant is
friendly toward the caster. An object or plant has characteristics as if
it were an animated object, except that its Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores are all 3d6. Animated objects and plants gain the
ability to move their limbs, projections, roots, carved legs and arms,
or other appendages, and have senses similar to a human's. A newly
intelligent animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD.
Objects, animals, and plants speak one language that the caster knows,
plus one additional language that he or she knows per point of
Intelligence bonus (if any).

### Seed: Reflect

-   Abjuration
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 27
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** Until expended or 12 hours

Attacks targeted against the caster rebound on the original attacker.
Each use of the *reflect* seed in an epic spell is effective against one
type of attack only: spells (and spell-like effects), ranged attacks, or
melee attacks. To reflect an area spell, where the caster is not the
target but are caught in the vicinity, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+20. A single successful use of *reflect* expends its protection. Spells
developed with the *reflect* seed against spells and spell-like effects
return all spell effects of up to 1st level. For each additional level
of spells to be reflected, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20. Epic
spells are treated as 10th-level spells for this purpose.

The desired effect is automatically reflected if the spell in question
is 9th level or lower. An opposed caster level check is required when
the reflect seed is used against another epic spell. If the enemy
spellcaster gets his or her spell through by winning the caster level
check, the epic spell using the reflect seed is not expended, just
momentarily suppressed.

If the *reflect* seed is used against a melee attack or ranged attack,
five such attacks are automatically reflected back on the original
attacker. For each additional attack reflected, increase the Spellcraft
DC by +4. The reflected attack rebounds on the attacker using the same
attack roll. Once the allotted attacks are reflected, the spell using
the *reflect* seed is expended.

### Seed: Reveal

-   Divination
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 19 (see text)
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** See text
-   **Effect:** Magical sensor
-   **Duration:** 20 minutes (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

The caster of this seed can see some distant location or hear the sounds
at some distant location almost as if he or she was there. To both hear
and see, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. Distance is not a factor, but
the locale must be known---a place familiar to the caster or an obvious
one. The spell creates an invisible sensor that can be dispelled. Lead
sheeting or magical protection blocks the spell, and the caster senses
that the spell is so blocked. If the caster prefers to create a mobile
sensor (speed 30 feet) that he or she controls, increase the Spellcraft
DC by +2. To use the *reveal* seed to reach one specific different plane
of existence, increase the Spellcraft DC by +8. To allow magically
enhanced senses to work through a spell built with the *reveal* seed,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. To cast any spell from the sensor
whose range is touch or greater, increase the Spellcraft DC by +6;
however, the caster must maintain line of effect to the sensor at all
times. If the line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. To free the
caster of the line of effect restriction for casting spells through the
sensor, multiply the Spellcraft DC by x10.

The *reveal* seed has a base Spellcraft DC of 25 if used to pierce
illusions and see things as they really are. The caster can see through
normal and magical darkness, notice secret doors hidden by magic, see
the exact locations of creatures or objects under *blur* or
*displacement* effects, see invisible creatures or objects normally, see
through illusions, see onto the Ethereal Plane (but not into
extradimensional spaces), and see the true form of polymorphed, changed,
or transmuted things. The range of such sight is 120 feet.

The *reveal* seed can also be used to develop spells that will do any
one of the following: duplicate the *read magic* spell, comprehend the
written and verbal language of another, or speak in the written or
verbal language of another. To both comprehend and speak a language,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +4.

### Seed: Slay

-   Necromancy \[Death\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 25
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** One living creature
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial or half (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A spell developed using the *slay* seed snuffs out the life force of a
living creature, killing it instantly. The *slay* seed kills a creature
of up to 80 HD. The subject is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to
survive the attack. If the save is successful, it instead takes 3d6+20
points of damage. For each additional 80 HD affected (or each additional
creature affected), increase the Spellcraft DC by +8. Alternatively, a
caster can use the *slay* seed in an epic spell to suppress the life
force of the target by bestowing 2d4 negative levels on the target (or
half as many negative levels on a successful Fortitude save). For each
additional 1d4 negative levels bestowed, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+4. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, it
dies. If the subject survives and the negative levels persist for 24
hours or longer, the subject must make another Fortitude saving throw,
or the negative levels are converted to actual level loss.

### Seed: Summon

-   Conjuration (Summoning)
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 14
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 75 ft.
-   **Effect:** One summoned creature
-   **Duration:** 20 rounds (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (see text)

This seed can summon an outsider. It appears where the caster designates
and acts immediately, on his or her turn, if its spell resistance is
overcome and it fails a Will saving throw. It attacks the caster's
opponents to the best of its ability. If the caster can communicate with
the outsider, he or she can direct it not to attack, to attack
particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures an
outsider the caster selects of CR 2 or less. For each +1 CR of the
summoned outsider, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. For each additional
outsider of the same Challenge Rating summoned, multiply the Spellcraft
DC by x2. When a caster develops a spell with the *summon* seed that
summons an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water
creature, the completed spell is also of that type.

If the caster increases the Spellcraft DC by +10, he or she can summon a
creature of CR 2 or less from another monster type or subtype. The
summoned creature is assumed to have been plucked from some other plane
(or somewhere on the same plane). The summoned creature attacks the
caster's opponents to the best of its ability; or, if the caster can
communicate with it, it will perform other actions. However, the
summoning ends if the creature is asked to perform a task inimical to
its nature. For each +1 CR of the summoned creature, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2.

Finally, by increasing the Spellcraft DC by +60, the caster can summon a
unique individual he or she specifies from anywhere in the multiverse.
The caster must know the target's name and some facts about its life,
defeat any magical protection against discovery or other protection
possessed by the target, and overcome the target's spell resistance, and
it must fail a Will saving throw. The target is under no special
compulsion to serve the caster.

### Seed: Transform

-   Transmutation
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 21
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** 300 ft.
-   **Target:** One creature or inanimate, nonmagical object
-   **Duration:** Permanent
-   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Spells using the *transform* seed change the subject into another form
of creature or object. The new form can range in size from Diminutive to
one size larger than the subject's normal form. For each additional
increment of size change, increase the Spellcraft DC by +6. If the
caster wants to transform a nonmagical, inanimate object into a creature
of his or her type or transform a creature into a nonmagical, inanimate
object, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. To change a creature of one
type into another type increase the Spellcraft DC by +5.

Transformations involving nonmagical, inanimate substances with hardness
are more difficult; for each 2 points of hardness, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +1.

To transform a creature into an incorporeal or gaseous form, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +10. Conversely, to overcome the natural immunity
of a gaseous or incorporeal creature to transformation, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +10.

The *transform* seed can also change its target into someone specific.
To transform an object or creature into the specific likeness of another
individual (including memories and mental abilities), increase the
Spellcraft DC by +25. If the transformed creature doesn't have the level
or Hit Dice of its new likeness, it can only use the abilities of the
creature at its own level or Hit Dice. If slain or destroyed, the
transformed creature or object reverts to its original form. The
subject's equipment, if any, remains untransformed or melds into the new
form's body, at the caster's option. The transformed creature or object
acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature or object it
has been changed into while retaining its own memories and mental
ability scores. Mental abilities include personality, Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any
change in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, base
saves, extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but
not its supernatural abilities. Physical abilities include natural size
and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities
include armor, natural weapons, and similar gross physical qualities
(presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth), and
possibly hardness. Creatures transformed into inanimate objects do not
gain the benefit of their untransformed physical abilities, and may well
be blind, deaf, dumb, and unfeeling. Objects transformed into creatures
gain that creature's average physical ability scores, but are considered
to have mental ability scores of 0 (the *fortify* seed can add points to
each mental ability, if desired). For each normal extraordinary ability
or supernatural ability granted to the transformed creature, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +10. The transformed subject can have no more Hit
Dice than the caster has or than the subject has (whichever is greater).
In any case, for each Hit Die the assumed form has above 15, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +2.

### Seed: Transport

-   Conjuration \[Teleportation\]
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 27
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** You and touched objects or other touched willing
    creatures weighing up to 1,000 lb.
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous, or 5 rounds for temporal transport
-   **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates (see text)
-   **Spell Resistance:** No or Yes (see text)

Spells using the *transport* seed instantly take the caster to a
designated destination, regardless of distance. For interplanar travel,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. For each additional 50 pounds in
objects and willing creatures beyond the base 1,000 pounds, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2. The base use of the *transport* seed provides
instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. To shift the
transportation medium to another medium increase the Spellcraft DC by
+2. The caster does not need to make a saving throw, nor is spell
resistance applicable to him or her. Only objects worn or carried
(attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.
For a spell intended to transport unwilling creatures, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +4. The caster must have at least a reliable
description of the place to which he or she is transporting. If the
caster attempts to use the *transport* seed with insufficient or
misleading information, the character disappears and simply reappear in
his or her original location.

As a special use of the *transport* seed, a caster can develop a spell
that temporarily transports him or her into a different time stream
(leaving the caster in the same physical location); this increases the
Spellcraft DC by +8. If the caster moves him or herself, or the subject,
into a slower time stream for 5 rounds, time ceases to flow for the
subject, and its condition becomes fixed---no force or effect can harm
it until the duration expires. If the caster moves him or her self into
a faster time stream, the caster speeds up so greatly that all other
creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their
normal speeds. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time.
Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still harm the caster.
While the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are
invulnerable to his or her attacks and spells; however, the caster can
create spell effects and leave them to take effect when he or she
reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of time, epic
spells used to transport a subject into a faster time stream cannot be
made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be extended. More
simply, the seed can *haste* or *slow* a subject for 20 rounds by
transporting it to the appropriate time stream. This decreases the
Spellcraft DC by --4.

### Seed: Ward

-   Abjuration
-   **Spellcraft DC:** 14
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target or Effect:** Touched creature or object of 2,000 lb. or
    less; or 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you
-   **Duration:** 24 hours
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This seed can grant a creature protection from damage of a specified
type. The caster can protect a creature from standard damage or from
energy damage. The caster can protect a creature or area from magic.
Alternatively, he or she can hedge out a type of creature from a
specified area. A ward against standard damage protects a creature from
whichever two the caster selects of the three damage types: bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing. For a ward against all three types, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +4. Each round, the spell created with the *ward* seed
absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take,
regardless of whether the source of the damage is natural or magical.
For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+2.

A ward against energy grants a creature protection from whichever one
the caster selects of the five energy types: acid, cold, electricity,
fire, or sonic. Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5 points of
damage the creature would otherwise take from the specified energy type,
regardless of whether the source of damage is natural or magical. The
spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. For each additional
point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1.

A ward against a specific type of creature prevents bodily contact from
whichever one of several monster types the caster selects. This causes
the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures
to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The
protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or
intentionally moves within 5 feet of the blocked creature. Spell
resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch
the warded creature.

A ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical
sphere (with radius 10 feet) that surrounds the caster and excludes all
spell effects of up to 1st level. Alternatively, the caster can ward
just the target and not create the radius effect. For each additional
level of spells to be excluded, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20 (but
see below). The area or effect of any such spells does not include the
area of the ward, and such spells fail to affect any target within the
ward. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like
effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can be cast through
or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to the protected
area without penalty (unless the spell specifically targets a creature
and does not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by
a targeted *dispel magic* spell. Epic spells using the *dispel* seed may
bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level
check. The ward may also be brought down with a targeted epic spell
using the *destroy* seed if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster
level check.

Instead of creating an epic spell that uses the *ward* seed to nullify
all spells of a given level and lower, the caster can create a ward that
nullifies a specific spell (or specific set of spells). For each
specific spell so nullified, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2 per spell
level above 1st.

## Epic Psionic Powers

The following adjustments should be made if taking psionic characters to
epic levels.

### Epic Psionic Seeds

-   Psionic characters can acquire epic powers. Generally, all the epic
    spell rules work for epic powers as well, except as noted below for
    displays.

Psionic characters take the Epic Manifestation feat, which works just
like the Epic Spellcasting feat. The prerequisites for this feat are 24
ranks of Psicraft, 24 ranks of Knowledge (psionics), and the ability to
manifest 9th-level psionic powers.

Just as spellcasters use no spell slots to cast epic spells, psionic
characters use no power points to manifest epic powers. Instead, they
freely manifest their known epic powers a number of times per day equal
to their Knowledge (psionics) skill divided by 10 (round down).

## Non-Epic Spell

### Genesis

-   Conjuration (Creation)
-   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9, Creation 9
-   **Components:** V, S, M, XP
-   **Casting Time:** 1 week (8 hours/day)
-   **Range:** 180 ft. (see text)
-   **Effect:** A demiplane coterminous with the Ethereal Plane,
    centered on your location
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

The spellcaster creates a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane.
Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes.

A character can only cast this spell while on the Ethereal Plane. When
he or she casts the spell, a local density fluctuation precipitates the
creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate
of 1 foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as
it rapidly draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and
protomatter.

The spellcaster determines the environment within the demiplane when he
or she first casts *genesis,* reflecting most any desire the spellcaster
can visualize. The spellcaster determines factors such as atmosphere,
water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This spell
cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create
construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth).
The spellcaster must add these things in some other fashion if he or she
desires. Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the
spellcaster can continue to cast this spell to enlarge the demiplane,
adding another 180 feet of radius to the demiplane each time.

*Material Component:* A crystalline sphere

*XP Cost:* 5,000 XP.
