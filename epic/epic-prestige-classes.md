  : Table: The Agent Retriever

### Class Features

The following are class features of the agent retriever prestige class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
An agent retriever gains no
proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

### Spells per Day/Spells Known
At each agent retriever level, the
character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as
if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he
or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an
epic spellcaster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the
Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any
other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the
character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an agent
retriever, the player must decide to which class to add the new level
for the purpose of determining spells per day.

### *Uncanny Location* (Sp)
When a agent retriever spends one day
attuning him or herself to a person or object he or she is seeking, he
or she automatically determines that person's or item's location as the
*discern location* spell. Once he or she has established a sense of the
location, the agent retriever can maintain this uncanny link even if the
target moves, but only so long as he or she hunts down this person or
item to the exclusion of all other pursuits. If he or she ever turns
aside to undertake a second pursuit, the *uncanny location* ends, and
the agent retriever must spend another day to reattune him or herself to
the target.

### Tracking Bonus (Ex)
The agent retriever gains a +10 insight bonus
on Wilderness Lore checks to track the quarry. This bonus increases by
+10 every five levels thereafter.

### *Plane Shift* (Sp)
The agent retriever can use *plane shift* as a
14th-level caster once per day starting at 2nd level, plus one
additional time per day every five levels thereafter.

### *Force Sphere* (Sp)
The agent retriever gains the ability to call
forth a *force sphere.* The agent retriever can attempt to enclose any
creature or object he or she can see within 30 feet. The target is
allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + 1/2 the class level of the agent
retriever + the agent retriever's Dexterity modifier). Those who fail
are then encapsulated in a sphere of force with a radius of up to 50
feet (the sphere is only as large as it needs to be, up to its maximum
radius). Those trapped inside cannot escape except with methods that can
bypass or destroy a *wall of force.*The sphere persists as long as the
agent retriever desires, up to a maximum of seven days. A captured
target does not count toward the capacity of the agent retriever's
*plane shift* ability, and the agent retriever can plane shift with the
target despite the presence of the *force sphere.* The agent retriever
can use this power once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time
per day every five levels thereafter.

### *Ethereal Jaunt* (Sp)
The agent retriever can use *ethereal jaunt*
as a 14th-level caster once per day at 4th level, plus one additional
time per day every five levels thereafter.

### Bonus Feats
The agent retriever gets a bonus feat at 5th level and
an additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter. These bonus feats
must be selected from the following list: Epic Endurance, Epic Prowess,
Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Fast Healing, Improved
Combat Casting, Improved Spell Capacity, Legendary Climber, Legendary
Rider, Legendary Tracker, Perfect Health, Permanent Emanation,
Spontaneous Spell, Storm of Throws, Swarm of Arrows, and Uncanny
Accuracy.

  : Table: The Cosmic Descryer

### Class Features

The following are class features of the cosmic descryer prestige class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
A cosmic descryer gains no proficiency
with any weapons, armor, or shields.

### Spells per Day/Spells Known
At every other cosmic descryer level,
the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable)
as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which
he or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an
epic spellcaster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the
Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any
other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the
character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a cosmic
descryer, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for
the purpose of determining spells per day.

### Superior Planar Summoning (Ex)
Beginning at 1st level, the cosmic
descryer can increase the power of any of the following
spells---*elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar
binding, summon monster IX,* or *summon nature's ally IX---to*affect or
summon outsiders of 4 Hit Dice higher than the spell's normal limit or
conjure creatures with 4 Hit Dice of advancement. Every four levels
thereafter, the cosmic descryer can increase the number of extra Hit
Dice by 4.

### Naturalization (Ex)
Starting at 2nd level, the cosmic descryer
develops a natural affinity for one plane that he or she has visited,
becoming resistant to any spells and spell-like effects that would
normally affect any creature not native to that plane. Every two levels
thereafter, the cosmic descryer gains naturalization to one additional
plane.

### Enduring Gate (Su)
Starting at 3rd level, as a full-round action,
the cosmic descryer can make any casting of the *gate* spell remain for
a full day, rather than disappearing after 1 round per caster level.
Every three levels thereafter, the cosmic descryer can increase the
duration of *gate* by one additional day.

### Bonus Feat (Ex)
The cosmic descryer gains a bonus feat at 5th level
and an additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter. These bonus
feats must be selected from the following list: Augmented Alchemy,
Automatic Quicken Spell, Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell,
Combat Casting, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Rod, Craft
Epic Staff, Craft Epic Wondrous Item, Efficient Item Creation, Enhance
Spell, Epic Spell Focus, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spellcasting,
Familiar Spell, Forge Epic Ring, Ignore Material Components, Improved
Combat Casting, Improved Heighten Spell, Improved Metamagic, Improved
Spell Capacity, Intensify Spell, Multispell, Permanent Emanation, Scribe
Epic Scroll, Spell Focus, Spell Knowledge, Spell Mastery, Spell
Opportunity, Spell Penetration, Spell Stowaway, Spontaneous Spell,
Tenacious Magic.

### Cosmic Connection (Su)
At 7th level, the cosmic descryer may join
with the massive energy of the multiverse once per day, plus one
additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The cosmic
descryer can remain connected for a number of minutes equal to his or
her class level. While connected, the character is immune to critical
hits, is a native on any plane he or she visits, and can use *dimension
door* at will as a 20th-level caster. The cosmic descryer can draw off
excess energy from the multiverse itself to increase his or her
effective caster level or enhance any attack roll, saving throw, skill
check, or ability check. Drawing off excess energy from the multiverse
is dangerous, and it deals the cosmic descryer 5 points of damage for
each +1 bonus applied to a single roll or +1 caster level on a single
spell.

## Divine Emissary

### Hit Die
d10.

### Requirements

To become a divine emissary, the character must fulfill all the
following criteria.

### Base Attack Bonus
+23.

### Feats
Weapon Focus (deity's favored weapon).

### Epic Feat
Great Smiting.

### Skills
Knowledge (religion) 10 ranks.

### Special
Must have a patron deity. Furthermore, the potential divine
emissary must complete some quest that furthers his or her deity's goals
so much that it impresses the deity.

Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha),
Gather Information (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge
(religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis),

### Table : the Divine Emissary

  ------- --------------------------------------------
  Level   Special
  1st     *Divine inspiration* 1/day, granted domain
  2nd     Extra smite 2/day
  3rd     *Greater planar ally* 1/day
  4th     *Divine inspiration* 2/day
  5th     Extra smite 3/day
  6th     Bonus feat
  7th     *Divine inspiration* 3/day
  8th     Extra smite 4/day
  9th     Divine hand 1/day
  10th    *Divine inspiration* 4/day
  ------- --------------------------------------------

### Class Features

All the following are features of the divine emissary prestige class.

### Spells per Day/Spells Known
At each divine emissary level, the
character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as
if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he
or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an
epic spell-caster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the
Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any
other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the
character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a divine
emissary, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for
the purpose of determining spells per day.

### Special Mount
If he or she has one, the divine emissary's special
mount continues to increase in power. Every five levels after 1st, the
special mount gains +2 bonus Hit Dice, its natural armor increases by
+2, its Strength adjustment increases by +1, and its Intelligence
increases by +1. The mount's spell resistance equals the divine
emissary's class level + the class level that provided the special
mount + 5.

### Granted Domain (Ex)
A divine emissary gains access to one of his or
her deity's domains, as well as the granted power of that domain. The
extra domain expands a paladin's selection of spells, but he or she does
not gain the ability to cast higher-level spells than he or she
otherwise could. Clerics gain an additional domain but otherwise use the
rules for preparing spells from their domains normally.

### *Divine Inspiration* (Sp)
A divine emissary gains a +2 luck bonus
on his or her attack and damage rolls for 10 rounds, once per day at 1st
level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.

### Extra Smite (Su)
A divine emissary can use his or her smite ability
two extra times per day, plus one additional time per day every three
levels thereafter. To determine the damage with any smite attack, a
divine emissary adds together his or her divine emissary levels and
class levels that originally conferred the smite ability.

### *Greater Planar Ally* (Sp)
The emissary can call a *greater planar
ally* (as the spell) once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time
per day every ten levels thereafter. The ally does not request a return
favor when a divine emissary uses this ability.

### Bonus Feats
The divine emissary gains a bonus feat at 6th level and
an additional bonus feat every ten levels thereafter. These bonus feats
must be selected from the following list: Armor Skin, Devastating
Critical, Epic Leadership, Epic Prowess, Epic Reputation, Epic
Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Great Smiting, Holy Strike, Improved Aura
of Courage, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Spell Capacity, Legendary
Commander, Legendary Rider, Overwhelming Critical, Perfect Health,
Permanent Emanation, Planar Turning, Positive Energy Aura, Spectral
Strike, Spontaneous Spell, Widen Aura of Courage.

### Divine Hand (Su)
As a free action, the emissary gains a +20 sacred
(or profane if appropriate) bonus on his next melee or ranged attack
roll, as long as the attack is made with the deity's favored weapon. The
emissary can use divine hand once per day at 9th level, plus one
additional time per day every ten levels thereafter.

  3rd     Read thoughts 1/day, *mind blank* 1/day

  9th     Improved cover identity (5)
  10th    Far senses 4/day, sneak attack +4d6
  ------- --------------------------------------------------

  : Table: The Epic Infiltrator

### Class Features

The following are class features of the epic infiltrator prestige class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
An epic infiltrator is proficient with
all simple and martial weapons, all armor, and shields.

### Improved Cover Identity (Ex/Su)
At 1st level, an epic infiltrator
establishes three specific cover identities, plus one additional cover
identity every four levels thereafter. While operating in a cover
identity, the epic infiltra-tor gains a +4 circumstance bonus on
Disguise checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather
Information checks. When the epic infiltrator has the option of adding a
new cover identity, he or she may instead work on further perfecting a
cover identity already possessed. An improved cover identity grants a +6
circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +4 circumstance bonus on
Bluff and Gather Information checks while operating in that identity. A
specific cover identity may be improved multiple times, each time adding
+2 to the bonuses. It is impossible to detect the epic infiltrator's
alignment with any form of divination. This ability functions exactly
like an *undetectable alignment* spell, except that it is always active
as a supernatural ability. Only divinations are confounded; spells that
function only against certain alignments affect the epic infiltrator
normally. Should the epic infiltrator wish to "retire" a cover identity
and develop a new one, he or she must spend one week practicing the new
identity before he or she earns the bonuses. Cover identities do not in
themselves provide the epic infiltrator with additional skills,
proficiencies, or class features that others might expect of the
pretended professions. The epic infiltrator can switch cover identities
or don a disguise using the Disguise skill in 1d3 minutes. He or she can
also put on or take off armor in one-half the normal time.

### Sneak Attack
If an epic infiltrator can catch an opponent when the
opponent is unable to defend effectively from his or her attack, he or
she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the epic
infiltrator's target would be denied his or her Dexterity bonus to AC
(whether he or she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the epic
infiltrator's attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage
increases by +1d6 points every three levels. Should the epic infiltrator
score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not
multiplied. Ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target
is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, the epic
infiltrator can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of
normal damage. He or she cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to
deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual --4
penalty. An epic infiltrator can only sneak attack living creatures with
discernible anatomies---undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and
incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any
creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks.
Also, the epic infiltrator must also be able to see the target well
enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot.
The epic infiltrator cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature
with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are
beyond reach. If an epic infiltrator gets a sneak attack bonus from
another source, the bonuses to damage stack.

### Specialist Training (Ex)
At 2nd level, the epic infiltrator gains
the benefit of focusing his or her craft on a particular type of work,
specializing in one of the following categories and receiving a +3 bonus
on all checks with the listed skills. Every three levels thereafter, the
epic infiltrator gains specialist training again. He or she may select
the same category more than once.

*Concealment:* Bluff, Disguise, and Forgery.

*Subterfuge:* Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, and Pick Pocket.

*Espionage:* Listen, Search, and Spot.

*Interaction:* Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense
Motive.

### Read Thoughts (Su)
Beginning at 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can
*detect thoughts* as the spell cast by a 15th-level caster, except that
it targets a single mind. Every four levels thereafter, the epic
infiltrator can per-form this ability one additional time per day.

### Far Senses (Su)
Starting at 4th level, the epic infiltrator can
extend his or her vision or hearing into an area beyond his or her
normal range, once per day, to a distance of 20 feet plus an additional
20 feet per epic infiltrator level. The epic infiltrator must have
personally visited the physical location earlier to use far senses on
it. Barriers do not impede far senses, and low-light vision or
darkvision function normally if the epic infiltrator has one or both of
those abilities. Far senses can also apply to the epic infiltrator's
read thoughts ability. Every two levels beyond 4th the epic infiltrator
can perform this ability one additional time per day. This ability
functions as the *clairaudience/clairvoyance* spell cast by a 15th-level
caster, except for the limit on range, the need to know the locale
beforehand, and the ability to use the read thoughts ability.

### *Mind Blank* (Sp)
At 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can become
immune to all mind-affecting spells and divinations once per day, plus
one additional time per day every eight levels thereafter. This ability
works as the *mind blank* spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

## Guardian Paramount

### Hit Die
d10.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a guardian paramount, a character must fulfill all
the following criteria.

### Base Attack Bonus
+15.

### Skills
Spot 13 ranks.

### Feats
Alertness, Lightning Reflexes.

### Epic Feats
Blinding Speed, Superior Initiative.

### Special
Uncanny dodge, evasion.

### Class Skills

The guardian paramount's class skills (and the key ability for each
skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha),
Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

### Skill Points at Each Level
4 + Int modifier.

  ------- ---------------------------------------------------
  Level   Special
  1st     Bonus feat, uncanny dodge enabler 3/day
  2nd     Evasive preceptor 1/day

  9th     *Protective aura* 3/day
  10th    Bonus feat, uncanny dodge enabler 6/day
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------

  : Table: The Guardian Paramount

### Class Features

The following are class features of the guardian paramount prestige
class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
A guardian paramount is proficient
with all simple and martial weapons, all armor, and shields.

### Bonus Feats
The guardian paramount gets a bonus feat at 1st level
and an additional bonus feat every three levels thereafter. These bonus
feats must be selected from the following list: Bulwark of Defense,
Combat Archery, Damage Reduction, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will,
Epic Dodge, Epic Fortitude, Epic Reflexes, Epic Reputation, Epic Skill
Focus, Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Epic Trapfinding, Epic Will,
Exceptional Deflection, Fast Healing, Great Dexterity, Improved Combat
Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Improved Spell Resistance, Infinite
Deflection, Legendary Climber, Lingering Damage, Mobile Defense, Perfect
Health, Reflect Arrows, Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity,
Spellcasting Harrier, and Uncanny Accuracy.

### Uncanny Dodge Enabler (Ex)
The guardian paramount must have the
uncanny dodge class feature to qualify for the prestige class, so at a
minimum the guardian paramount has the extraordinary ability to retain
his or her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught
flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. It is possible that the
character has higher-level aspects of the uncanny dodge ability.
Whatever the level of uncanny dodge attained by the character, the
guardian paramount can extend the features of his or her uncanny dodge
ability to include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet
of him or her (he or she can designate a creature or change designations
as a free action once per round). The guardian paramount can extend his
or her uncanny dodge ability three times per day at 1st level, plus one
additional time per day every three levels thereafter.

### Evasive Preceptor (Ex)
The guardian paramount must have the evasion
class feature, which allows the character to take no damage from an area
attack with a successful Reflex save. He or she may also have improved
evasion, though this is not a prerequisite. The character can extend
evasion or improved evasion to include any one creature he or she
designates within 5 feet of him or her. The guardian paramount can
extend his or her evasion ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one
additional time per day every three levels thereafter.

### *Protective Aura* (Sp)
Starting at 3rd level, the guardian
paramount can use a special form of *shield other* once per day, plus
one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. When a
guardian paramount creates a *protective aura,*the transferred wounds
are dealt to the guardian paramount as subdual damage, not normal
damage, as with the *shield other* spell. Otherwise, the guardian
paramount's *protective aura* functions like the *shield other spell*
cast by an 8th-level cleric.

### Adjust Probability (Ex)
On reaching 5th level, the guardian
paramount gains the ability to affect probability twice per day, plus
one additional time per day per three levels thereafter. The guardian
paramount can force a reroll of one attack roll, check, or saving throw
that another creature within 25 feet---friend or enemy---just made. The
guardian paramount can find out whether the attack roll, check, or save
would have succeeded before using this ability. The recipient must take
the second roll, whether it's better or worse than the original roll.
The use of this ability takes place outside the normal initiative order,
but the paramount guardian can't use it if he or she is flat-footed or
unable to see the situation resulting in the roll. The guardian
paramount must decide whether to reroll as soon as the result of the
attack roll, check, or save is known.

### *Call Back* (Sp)
On reaching 6th level, the guardian paramount
gains the ability to return a dead creature that he or she has
previously used any of his or her other class abilities on back to life,
as if he or she had cast *true resurrection* as a 20th-level cleric. The
character can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time
per day every six levels.

  10th    *Heal* 3/day                        +1 level of divine spellcasting class
  ------- ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------------

  : Table: The High Proselytizer

### Class Features

The following are class features of the high proselytizer prestige
class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
High proselytizers are proficient with
all simple weapons, all armor, and all shields.

### Spells per Day
At every other high proselytizer level, the
character gains new spells per day as if he or she had also gained a
level in a divine spellcasting class to which he or she belonged before
adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the
character gains only the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that
epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a
character of that class would have gained. If the character had more
than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a high proselytizer,
the player must decide to which class to add each high proselytizer
level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

### *Proselytize* (Sp)
At 1st level, the high proselytizer gains the
ability to preach the word of his or her deity to large crowds with
great effect. He or she may speak in such a manner once per day, plus
one additional time per day per ten class levels thereafter.

*Proselytize* has three effects. First, any time the high proselytizer
is speaking in this manner, he or she is treated as though affected by a
*sanctuary* spell. Second, his or her voice can be heard clearly by
anyone within a radius of 100 feet plus 50 feet per class level,
regardless of background noise, and his or her speech can be understood
as though the audience were affected by a *comprehend languages* spell.
Finally, everyone in the range of the high proselytizer's voice
immediately has a chance of becoming enraptured:

  ------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Type of Listener               Effect
  Followers of the same deity    Automatic if 10 or fewer HD, otherwise Will save (DC 20 + 1/2 high proselytizer's class level + Wis modifier)
  Others of the same alignment   Automatic if 5 or fewer HD, otherwise Will save (as above)
  All others                     Will save (as above)
  ------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enraptured audience members act as though affected by a *symbol of
persuasion*, changing alignment as appropriate and otherwise functioning
according to the *charm person* spell. The high proselytizer can inspire
the crowd to take any of a number of actions, depending on his or her
alignment. Any suicidal suggestion grants audience members a new saving
throw to break the rapture (with the exception of low-level followers of
the same deity, who never got a save in the first place). This rapture
lasts for 10 minutes plus an additional 5 minutes per high proselytizer
level.

At 3rd level, the high proselytizer's proselytize ability includes
deific touch once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten
levels thereafter. During his or her speech, the high proselytizer can
move among the enraptured, shaking hands, caressing brows, and otherwise
making contact with audience members. Anyone so touched is healed of 1d4
points of damage and cured of any natural disease or poison. Up to six
individuals per round can be so affected. An audience member can only
benefit from deific touch once per proselytize session. The high
proselytizer can use deific touch as long as his or her proselytize
ability lasts.

At 5th level, the *proselytize* ability includes *deific word* once per
day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. The
words spoken by the high proselytizer can, if he or she chooses,
function as a triple-strength *sound burst* spell (3d8 points of sonic
damage and a Will save to avoid being stunned for 3 rounds) to all who
are not enraptured, as the spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The
*deific word* can occur at any point during his or her *proselytize*
speech.

At 7th level, the *proselytize* ability includes *deific face* once per
day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. When
the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a blinding burst to
shine from his or her face. *Deific face* functions against all in the
audience who are not enraptured as the *sunburst* spell cast by a
20th-level cleric. The *deific face* can occur at any point during his
or her speech.

At 9th level, the *proselytize* ability includes *deific aura* once per
day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. When
the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a rolling wave of
deific power to spring from his or her body that functions as either a
*blasphemy, dictum, holy word,* or *word of chaos* spell (as appropriate
for his or her alignment), affecting only those in the audience who have
resisted becoming enraptured. *Deific aura* otherwise functions as the
relevant spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The *deific aura* can occur
at any point during his or her speech.

### *Heal* (Sp)
At 2nd level, the high proselytizer can use *heal* on
his or herself or another creature once per day, plus one additional
time per day per four levels thereafter.

### Bonus Feats
The high proselytizer gets a bonus feat at 4th level
and an additional bonus feat every four levels thereafter. These bonus
feats must be chosen from the following list: Armor Skin, Automatic
Quicken Spell, Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Bonus
Domain, Enhance Spell, Epic Reputation, Epic Spell Focus, Epic Spell
Penetration, Epic Spellcasting, Epic Will, Extended Life Span, Great
Charisma, Great Wisdom, Ignore Material Components, Improved
Alignment-Based Casting, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Heighten
Spell, Improved Metamagic, Improved Spell Capacity, Intensify Spell,
Legendary Commander, Multispell, Negative Energy Burst, Per-manent
Emanation, Planar Turning, Polyglot, Positive Energy Aura, Spectral
Strike, Spell Stowaway, Spell Opportunity, Spontaneous Domain Access,

### Class Features

The following are class features of the legendary dreadnought prestige
class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
A legendary dreadnought is proficient
with all simple and martial weapons, all armor, and all shields.

### Unstoppable (Ex)
At 1st level, the legendary dreadnought can
concentrate his or her power, gaining a +20 bonus on his or her Strength
check to break or burst a door or item once per day, plus one additional
time per day every five levels thereafter. As a special use of this
ability, the legendary dreadnought can attempt to break a *wall of
force* (Strength DC 32, and the character applies his or her unstoppable
bonus to this check as well). Alternatively, the legendary dreadnought
can apply the +20 bonus to a single attack roll.

### Unmovable (Ex)
At 2nd level, the legendary dreadnought can
concentrate his or her power, making him or herself unmovable once per
day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. This
power grants the character a +20 bonus on any one of the following:

A grapple check made to avoid being grabbed with the improved grab
ability.

A Strength check to avoid the effects of a bull rush, trip attempt, or
similar effect.

A Strength check against any effect that would move the character either
physically or magically.

Any one saving throw. If an effect that would move the character either
physically or magically does not normally allow a saving throw, the
legendary dreadnought can use this ability to gain a Will saving throw.
He or she still gains the +20 bonus on the saving throw in such a case.

### Shrug off Punishment (Ex)
The legendary dreadnought gains 12 bonus
hit points at 3rd level and 12 more every five levels thereafter.

### Thick Skinned (Ex)
At 4th level, the legendary dreadnought gains
damage reduction 3/--. This does not stack with damage reduction granted
by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects, but it does stack with
any damage reduction granted by permanent magical effects, class
features, the Damage Reduction feat, and this ability itself. The damage
reduction improves by 3 points every five levels thereafter

### Bonus Feats
The legendary dreadnought gets a bonus feat at 5th
level and an additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter. These
bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Armor Skin,

  ------- ----------------------------

  : Table: The Perfect Wight

### Class Features

The following are class features of the perfect wight prestige class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
A perfect wight gains no proficiency
with any weapons, armor, or shields.

### Greater Invisibility (Su)
Starting at 1st level, the perfect wight
gains the benefit of *greater invisibility* once per day, plus one
additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The *greater
invisibility* is as the spell cast by a 20th-level caster.

### Improved Legerdemain (Su)
A perfect wight can perform the following
class skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, Pick
Pocket, and Search. If desired, the perfect wight can take 10 on the
check. Any object manipulated during the skill check must weigh 100
pounds or less. Alternatively, the perfect wight can use improved
legerdemain to make one melee sneak attack against any creature within
30 feet. The perfect wight executes the sneak attack (or death attack,
if applicable) as if attacking from a flanking position. If the attack
is successful, the victim is dealt the appropriate sneak attack damage
despite the fact that the perfect wight and his or her weapon do not
physically cross the intervening distance. A perfect wight can use
improved legerdemain once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time
per day every five levels thereafter.

### Incorporeal (Su)
At 3rd level, the perfect wight can become
incorporeal once per day, plus one additional time per day every five
levels thereafter. A perfect wight can remain incorporeal for a number
of rounds equal to 20 + his or her perfect wight level. As an
incorporeal creature, the perfect wight can be harmed only by other
incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells,
spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. He or she is immune to
all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons,
the perfect wight has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal
source (except for force effectsor attacks made with ghost touch
weapons). An incorporeal perfect wight has no natural armor but has a
deflection bonus equal to his or her Charisma modifier (always at least
+1, even if his or her Charisma score does not normally provide a
bonus). An incorporeal perfect wight can pass through solid objects at
will, but not force effects. His or her attack ignores natural armor,
armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects work
normally against it. An incorporeal perfect wight moves silently and
cannot be heard with Listen checks if he or she doesn't wish to be.
While incorporeal, the perfect wight has no Strength score, so his or
her Dexterity modifier applies to both melee and ranged attacks.

### Shadow Form (Su)
At 4th level, the perfect wight can take shadow
form once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels
thereafter. The perfect wight's shadow form lasts 1 minute per level of
the prestige class. While in shadow form the perfect wight is
incorporeal (see above), is immune to critical hits, and can fly at a
speed of 100 feet (good). The perfect wight can also use the substance
of his or her own shadow to enhance his or her effective level on any
attack roll, check, or saving throw. Drawing power from his or her own
shadow form deals the perfect wight 7 points of damage for each +1 bonus
on a single roll or +1 effective level for any other single use.

### Bonus Feats
The perfect wight gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an
additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter. These bonus feats
must be selected from the following list: Blinding Speed, Combat
Archery, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Dodge, Epic
Reputation, Epic Skill Focus, Epic Speed, Epic Trapfinding, Improved
Combat Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Legendary Climber, Lingering
Damage, Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity, Spellcasting
Harrier, Superior Initiative, Uncanny Accuracy.
