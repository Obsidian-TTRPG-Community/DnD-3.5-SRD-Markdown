  : Table: The Barbarian

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the barbarian.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
A barbarian is proficient with all
simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields
(except tower shields).

### Fast Movement (Ex)
A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm
for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing
no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load.
Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any
load carried or armor worn.

### Illiteracy
Barbarians are the only characters who do not
automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill
points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to
speak.

A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains
literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose
the literacy he or she already had.

### Rage (Ex)
A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times
per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to
Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will
saves, but he takes a --2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in
Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level,
but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his
Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not
lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian
cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills
(except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the
Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or
concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that
require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell
completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has
except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit
of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly
improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his
rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and
restrictions and becomes fatigued (--2 penalty to Strength, --2 penalty
to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current
encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this
limitation no longer applies; see below).

A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he
can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four
levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a
maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no
time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in
response to someone else's action.

### Uncanny Dodge (Ex)
At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity
bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an
invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if
immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different
class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below)
instead.

### Trap Sense (Ex)
Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus
on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against
attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian
levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense
bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

### Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)
At 5th level and higher, a barbarian
can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to
sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at
least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a
character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the
character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the
levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the
minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.

### Damage Reduction (Ex)
At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage
Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he
is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and
every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level),
this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce
damage to 0 but not below 0.

### Greater Rage (Ex)
At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength
and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale
bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at --2.

### Indomitable Will (Ex)
While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or
higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This
bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on
Will saves he also receives during his rage.

### Tireless Rage (Ex)
At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer
becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.

### Mighty Rage (Ex)
At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength
and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale
bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at --2.

### Ex-Barbarians

A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain
more levels as a barbarian. He retains all the other benefits of the
class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).

## Bard

### Class Skills

  : Table: Bard Spells Known

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the bard.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
A bard is proficient with all simple
weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and
whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower
shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without
incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any
other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using
a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in
question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still
incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received
from other classes.

### Spells
A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard
spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of
time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or
music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score
equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving
throw against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's
Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells
of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on
Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has
a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the
bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the
bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for
that spell level.

The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play
knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he
gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known.
(Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not
affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known
are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th,
11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one
he already knows. In effect, the bard "loses" the old spell in exchange
for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the
spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the
highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a
single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap
the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can
cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his
allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

### Bardic Knowledge
A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check
with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see
whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people,
legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks
in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)

A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a
magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may
not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is
essentially random.

  ---- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DC   Type of Knowledge
  10   Common, known by at least a substantial minority drinking; common legends of the local population.
  20   Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.
  25   Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.
  30   Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.
  ---- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bardic Music
Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song
or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually
including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the
category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing
instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting,
singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an
instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken
performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a
minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does
not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he
does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed
ranks.

Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music
abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a
standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using
bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast
spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or
activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting
a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail
when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still
counts against his daily limit.

*Countersong (Su):* A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can
use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound
(but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the
countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of
the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or
language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check
result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is
rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature
within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a
noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains
another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the
countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the
save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves.
The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.

*Fascinate (Sp):* A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use
his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated
with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to
see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must
also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or
other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels
a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a
single use of this ability.

To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is
the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a
creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate
that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the
creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions,
for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a
maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a
--4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot
checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform
check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to
the new Perform check result.

Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell,
or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the
effect. *Fascinate* is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting
ability.

*Inspire Courage (Su):* A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill
can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including
himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat
abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing.
The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5
rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving
throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack
and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels
thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at
20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.

*Inspire Competence (Su):* A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more
ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally
succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and
hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.

The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular
skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. Certain
uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the
bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire
competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.

*Suggestion (Sp):* A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in
a Perform skill can make a *suggestion* (as the spell) to a creature
that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not
break the bard's concentration on the *fascinate* effect, nor does it
allow a second saving throw against the *fascinate* effect.

Making a *suggestion* doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on
bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's
level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects
only a single creature (but see *mass suggestion*, below). *Suggestion*
is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent
ability.

*Inspire Greatness (Su):* A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more
ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness
in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her
extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond
9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability
(two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness,
a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as
long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A
creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the
commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's
Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence
bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The
bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of
spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a
mind-affecting ability.

*Song of Freedom (Sp):* A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more
ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect
equivalent to the *break enchantment* spell (caster level equals the
character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of
uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single
target within 30 feet. A bard can't use *song of freedom* on himself.

*Inspire Heroics (Su):* A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more
ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous
heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every
three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire
heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing
and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so
inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus
to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and
for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting
ability.

*Mass Suggestion (Sp):* This ability functions like *suggestion,* above,
except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a
Perform skill can make the *suggestion* simultaneously to any number of
creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). *Mass suggestion*
is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent
ability.

### Ex-Bards

A bard who becomes lawful in alignment cannot progress in levels as a
bard, though he retains all his bard abilities.

## Cleric

### Alignment
A cleric's alignment must be within one step of his
deity's (that is, it may be one step away on either the lawful--chaotic
axis or the good--evil axis, but not both). A cleric may not be neutral

above. A cleric who chooses the Knowledge domain adds all Knowledge
(Int) skills to the list. A cleric who chooses the Travel domain adds
Survival (Wis) to the list. A cleric who chooses the Trickery domain
adds Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), and Hide (Dex) to the list. See Deity,
Domains, and Domain Spells, below, for more information.

: Table: The Cleric

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the cleric.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Clerics are proficient with all simple
weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with
shields (except tower shields).

A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat
related to his deity's weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the
appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the
weapon falls into that category.

### Aura (Ex)
A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a
particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see
the *detect evil* spell for details). Clerics who don't worship a
specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have
a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.

### Spells
A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the
cleric spell list. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting
certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic,
Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare
his spells in advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom
modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is
given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per
day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell
of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric
prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his
two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).

Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a
time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or
supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting
has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may
prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he
can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to
prepare during his daily meditation.

### Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells
A cleric's deity influences his
alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see
him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his
deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or
Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.

If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two
domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The
restriction on alignment domains still applies.

Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell
level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The
cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.

With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric
prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain
spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in
his domain spell slot.

### Spontaneous Casting
A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good
deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the
cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can "lose" any prepared
spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any *cure* spell of
the same spell level or lower (a *cure* spell is any spell with "cure"
in its name).

An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert
prepared spells to *cure* spells but can convert them to *inflict*
spells (an *inflict* spell is one with "inflict" in its name).

A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good
nor evil can convert spells to either *cure* spells or *inflict* spells
(player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be
reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or
commands undead (see below).

### Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells
A cleric can't cast spells
of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one).
Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos,
evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

### Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su)
Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has
the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his
faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).

A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn
or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who
worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A
neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning
ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this
choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines
whether the cleric can cast spontaneous *cure* or *inflict* spells (see
above).

A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to
3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge
(religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.

### Bonus Languages
A cleric's bonus language options include
Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil,
and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition
to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

### Ex-Clerics

A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god
loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield
proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter
gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the *atonement*
spell description).

  : Table: The Druid

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the druid.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Druids are proficient with the
following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle,
shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural
attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild
shape (see below).

Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited
from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or
hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by
the *ironwood* spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See
the *ironwood* spell description) Druids are proficient with shields
(except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.

A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is
unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like
class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

### Spells
A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid
spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells
opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and
Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in
advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom
modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is
given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per
day if she has a high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any
domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.

A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she
cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a *cure* spell in its place (but
see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell
on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that
level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily
meditation.

### Spontaneous Casting
A druid can channel stored spell energy into
summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can "lose"
a prepared spell in order to cast any *summon nature's ally* spell of
the same level or lower.

### Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells
A druid can't cast spells of
an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells
associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil,
good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

### Bonus Languages
A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan,
the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the
bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids,
which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free
language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular
allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids
are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.

Druidic has its own alphabet.

### Animal Companion (Ex)
A druid may begin play with an animal
companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat,
dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake
(Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or
partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also
available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is
a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as
appropriate for its kind.

A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except
as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power
increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from
service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24
uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal
companion that has perished.

A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of
animals (see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of
these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the
character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the
value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's
druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the
table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment
would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have
that animal as a companion.)

### Nature Sense (Ex)
A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature)
and Survival checks.

### Wild Empathy (Ex)
A druid can improve the attitude of an animal.
This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the
attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and
her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent,
while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each
other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under
normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1
minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an
Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a --4 penalty on the check.

### Woodland Stride (Ex)
Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move
through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without
taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns,
briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to
impede motion still affect her.

### Trackless Step (Ex)
Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail
in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a
trail if so desired.

### Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)
Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4
bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

### Wild Shape (Su)
At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn
herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her
options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This
ability functions like the *polymorph* spell, except as noted here. The
effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back.
Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't
provoke an attack of opportunity.

The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.

A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is
limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she
can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping
as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so
changing to this form does not permit speech.)

A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th,
and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the
ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal
at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.

The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.

At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a
plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A
druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a
creature.)

At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a
Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per
day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape
usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains
all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like
abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she
maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.

At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per
day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level,
a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.

### Venom Immunity (Ex)
At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all
poisons.

### A Thousand Faces (Su)
At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to
change her appearance at will, as if using the *alter self* spell, but
only while in her normal form.

### Timeless Body (Ex)
After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer
takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged.
Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.

Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time
is up.

### Ex-Druids

A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment,
or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid
abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon,
armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a
druid until she atones (see the *atonement* spell description).

### The Druid's Animal Companion

A druid's animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind
in many ways. A druid's animal companion is superior to a normal animal
of its kind and has special powers, as described below.

  ------------- ---------- -------------------- -------------- -------------- --------------------

### Animal Companion Basics
Use the base statistics for a creature of
the companion's kind,but make the following changes.

*Class Level:* The character's druid level. The druid's class levels
stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal
companion for the purpose of determining the companion's abilities and
the alternative lists available to the character.

*Bonus HD:* Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a
Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve
the animal companion's base attack and base save bonuses. An animal
companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level
equal to the animal's HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and
Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's
HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for
bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.

*Natural Armor Adj.:* The number noted here is an improvement to the
animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.

*Str/Dex Adj.:* Add this value to the animal companion's Strength and
Dexterity scores.

*Bonus Tricks:* The value given in this column is the total number of
"bonus" tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid
might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus
tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they
don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The
druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be
changed.

*Link (Ex):* A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action,
or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the
Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild
empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal
companion.

*Share Spells (Ex):* At the druid's option, she may have any spell (but
not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her
animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at
the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a
duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal
companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not
affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid before the
duration expires.

Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her
animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid
and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do
not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal).

*Evasion (Ex):* If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that
normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no
damage if it makes a successful saving throw.

*Devotion (Ex):* An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will
saves against enchantment spells and effects.

*Multiattack:* An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if
it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that
feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks,
the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary
natural weapon, albeit at a --5 penalty.

*Improved Evasion (Ex):* When subjected to an attack that normally
allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes
no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if
the saving throw fails.

: Table: The Monk

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the monk.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Monks are proficient with club,
crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku,
quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling.

Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields

When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load,
a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of
blows abilities.

### AC Bonus (Ex)
When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her
Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to
AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels
thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).

These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is
flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or
helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when
she carries a medium or heavy load.

### Flurry of Blows (Ex)
When unarmored, a monk may strike with a
flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make
one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this
attack takes a --2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round.
The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of
Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1
round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make
before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty
lessens to --1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full
attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.

When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes
or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai,
shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special
monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a
flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x
1-1/2 or x 1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether
she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can't use any weapon
other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.

In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon
for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the
quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse
unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough
attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so.

When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In
addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of
blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.

### Unarmed Strike
At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike
as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist
interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a
monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such
thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus
apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed
strikes.

Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose
to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She
has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.

A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a
natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or
improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal
person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table:
The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the
amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals
more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.

  : Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage

### Bonus Feat
At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple
or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either
Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may
select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk
need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats
to select them.

### Evasion (Ex)
At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful
Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on
a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only
if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not
gain the benefit of evasion.

### Fast Movement (Ex)
At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus
to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a
medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.

### Still Mind (Ex)
A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on
saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.

### *Ki* Strike (Su)
At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are
empowered with *ki.* Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons
for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction.
*Ki* strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her
unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of
dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her
unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of
dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing
hardness.

### Slow Fall (Ex)
At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of
a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability,
she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually
is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the
effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her
monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her
descent and fall any distance without harm.

### Purity of Body (Ex)
At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all
diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.

### Wholeness of Body (Su)
At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her
own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice
her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out
among several uses.

### Improved Evasion (Ex)
At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability
improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw
against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed
save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

### Diamond Body (Su)
At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons
of all kinds.

### Abundant Step (Su)
At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip
magically between spaces, as if using the spell *dimension door,* once
per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level
(rounded down).

### Diamond Soul (Ex)
At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance
equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a
spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 +
caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.

### Quivering Palm (Su)
Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up
vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be
fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack
once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack
roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and
creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the
monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the
quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the
victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number
of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk
merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target
makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the
monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the
target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm
attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.

### Timeless Body (Ex)
Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer
takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically
aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in
place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her
time is up.

### Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)
A monk of 17th level or higher can
speak with any living creature.

### Empty Body (Su)
At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume
an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using
the spell *etherealness*. She may go ethereal on a number of different
occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds
spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.

### Perfect Self
At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She
is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or
whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and
magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic,
which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack
made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature
that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the
monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of
her previous creature type.

### Ex-Monks

A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but
retains all monk abilities.

Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character,
but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new
class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may
never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk
abilities.
