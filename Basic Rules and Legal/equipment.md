# EQUIPMENT

Assume a character owns at least one outfit of normal clothes. Pick any
one of the following clothing outfits: artisan's outfit, entertainer's
outfit, explorer's outfit, monk's outfit, peasant's outfit, scholar's
outfit, or traveler's outfit.

## Wealth and Money

### Coins

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10
silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In
addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum
pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.

The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).

  : Table: Trade Goods

### Selling Loot

In general, a character can sell something for half its listed price.

Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade good, in
this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if
it were cash itself.
## Weapons

### Weapon Categories

Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories.

These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient
in a weapon's use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon's usefulness
either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes
both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light,
one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).

### Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons
Anybody but a druid, monk,
rogue, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians,
fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all
martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an
assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly also some martial or
even exotic weapons. A character who uses a weapon with which he or she
is not proficient takes a --4 penalty on attack rolls.

### Melee and Ranged Weapons
Melee weapons are used for making melee
attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are
thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.

*Reach Weapons:* Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs,
spiked chains, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee
weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren't adjacent
to him or her. Most reach double the wielder's natural reach, meaning
that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a
creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A
typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size
can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or
creatures up to 10 feet away.

*Double Weapons:* Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers,
orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords are double
weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if
fighting with two weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack
penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the
character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed,
attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon
in one hand can't use it as a double weapon---only one end of the weapon
can be used in any given round.

*Thrown Weapons:* Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins,
throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown
weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage
dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to
throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon
that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on
Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes a --4 penalty on the
attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action,
while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of
the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural
roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has
a range increment of 10 feet.

*Projectile Weapons:* Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows,
shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, hand
crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most
projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon
descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a
projectile weapon unless it's a specially built composite shortbow,
specially built composite longbow, or sling. If the character has a
penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she uses a
bow or a sling.

*Ammunition:* Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows),
bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings). When using a bow,
a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings
require an action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that
hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal
ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for
the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special
versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to them
after they are thrown.

### Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons
This designation is
a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It
indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the
weapon's size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed
weapon, or a two-handed weapon.

*Light:* A light weapon is easier to use in one's off hand than a
one-handed weapon is, and it can be used while grappling. A light weapon
is used in one hand. Add the wielder's Strength bonus (if any) to damage
rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it's used in the primary
hand, or one-half the wielder's Strength bonus if it's used in the off
hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on
damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the
wielder's primary hand only.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.

*One-Handed:* A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand
or the off hand. Add the wielder's Strength bonus to damage rolls for
melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it's used in the primary hand,
or 1/2 his or her Strength bonus if it's used in the off hand. If a
one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add
1-1/2 times the character's Strength bonus to damage rolls.

*Two-Handed:* Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon
effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character's Strength bonus to damage
rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.

### Weapon Size
Every weapon has a size category. This designation
indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.

A weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object.
Instead, a weapon's size category is keyed to the size of the intended
wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories
smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size
category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object
of the same size category as the wielder.

*Inappropriately Sized Weapons:* A creature can't make optimum use of a
weapon that isn't properly sized for it. A cumulative --2 penalty
applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the
size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the
creature isn't proficient with the weapon a --4 nonproficiency penalty
also applies.

The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the
weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a
particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of
difference between the wielder's size and the size of the creature for
which the weapon was designed. If a weapon's designation would be
changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this
alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons
nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for
this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be
nonproficient with it and takes a --4 penalty on attack rolls made with
that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for
an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to
the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores
a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical
hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

### Weapon Qualities

Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on
Table: Weapons, below).

### Cost
This value is the weapon's cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver
pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the
weapon.

This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A
Large version costs twice the listed price.

### Damage
The Damage columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a
successful hit. The column labeled "Dmg (S)" is for Small weapons. The
column labeled "Dmg (M)" is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are
given then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure
given for the double weapon's extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon
Damage gives weapon damage values for weapons of those sizes.

  ---------------------- -------------------- ---------------------

  ---------------------- -------------------- ---------------------

  : Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage

### Critical
The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with
the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit,
roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical
multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all
the results together.

*Exception:* Extra damage over and above a weapon's normal damage is not
multiplied when you score a critical hit.

*x2:* The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.

*x3:* The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.

*x3/x4:* One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a
critical hit. The other head deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.

*x4:* The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.

*19--20/x2:* The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20
(instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The
weapon has a threat range of 19--20.)

*18--20/x2:* The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or
20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The
weapon has a threat range of 18--20.)

### Range Increment
Any attack at less than this distance is not
penalized for range. However, each full range increment imposes a
cumulative --2 penalty on the attack roll. A thrown weapon has a maximum
range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten
range increments.

### Weight
This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the
weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons and double it for Large
weapons.

### Type
Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they
deal: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant
or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.

Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types,
the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all of it is
both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types
of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.

In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a
situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose
which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.

### Special
Some weapons have special features. See the weapon
descriptions for details.

: Table: Weapons

Weapons found on Table: Weapons that have special options for the
wielder ("you") are described below. Splash weapons are described under
Special Substances and Items.

### Arrows
An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light
improvised weapon (--4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a
dagger of its size (critical multiplier x2). Arrows come in a leather
quiver that holds 20 arrows. An arrow that hits its target is destroyed;
one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

### Axe, Orc Double
An orc double axe is a double weapon. You can fight
with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all
the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons,
just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

A creature wielding an orc double axe in one hand can't use it as a
double weapon---only one end of the weapon can be used in any given
round.

### Bolas
You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against
an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when
using a set of bolas.

### Bolts
A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light
improvised weapon (--4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a
dagger of its size (crit x2). Bolts come in a wooden case that holds 10
bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow). A bolt that hits its target is
destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

### Bullets, Sling
Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10
bullets. A bullet that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has
a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

### Chain, Spiked
A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents
10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach,
it can be used against an adjacent foe.

You can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your
own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped.

When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls
made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed
if such an attempt fails).

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier
instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain
sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.

### Crossbow, Hand
You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a
hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no
penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a
penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.

### Crossbow, Heavy
You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small
winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes
attacks of opportunity.

Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you
can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a --4 penalty
on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you
take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed
weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed
firing.

### Crossbow, Light
You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever.
Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of
opportunity.

Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you
can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a --2 penalty
on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you
take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.
This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.

### Crossbow, Repeating
The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light)
holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by
pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5
bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating
crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow
of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in
order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a
new case of bolts.

### Dagger
You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal
a dagger on your body (see the Sleight of Hand skill).

### Flail, Dire
A dire flail is a double weapon. You can fight with it
as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal
attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if
you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature
wielding a dire flail in one hand can't use it as a double weapon---
only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

When using a dire flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made
to disarm an enemy (including the opposed attack roll to avoid being
disarmed if such an attempt fails).

You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped
during your own trip attempt, you can drop the dire flail to avoid being
tripped.

### Flail or Heavy Flail
With a flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed
attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being
disarmed if such an attempt fails).

You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped
during your own trip attempt, you can drop the flail to avoid being
tripped.

### Gauntlet
This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than
nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is
otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are
for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come
with gauntlets.

### Gauntlet, Spiked
Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm
you of spiked gauntlets. The cost and weight given are for a single
gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed
attack.

### Glaive
A glaive has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away
with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

### Guisarme
A guisarme has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet
away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

You can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your
own trip attempt, you can drop the guisarme to avoid being tripped.

### Halberd
If you use a ready action to set a halberd against a
charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging
character.

You can use a halberd to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during
your own trip attempt, you can drop the halberd to avoid being tripped.

### Hammer, Gnome Hooked
A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon. You
can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you
incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two
weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light
weapon. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6
points of damage (crit x3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4
points of damage (crit x4). You can use either head as the primary
weapon. The other head is the offhand weapon. A creature wielding a
gnome hooked hammer in one hand can't use it as a double weapon---only
one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

You can use a gnome hooked hammer to make trip attacks. If you are
tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the gnome hooked
hammer to avoid being tripped.

Gnomes treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons.

### Javelin
Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as
nonproficient with it and take a --4 penalty on attack rolls if you use
a javelin as a melee weapon.

### Kama
The kama is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a
monk wielding a kama special options.

You can use a kama to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your
own trip attempt, you can drop the kama to avoid being tripped.

### Lance
A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a
charging mount. It has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away
with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.

### Longbow
You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its
size. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you
have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a
longbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to
damage rolls when you use a composite longbow (see below) but not a
regular longbow.

### Longbow, Composite
You need at least two hands to use a bow,
regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted.
All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is,
each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If
your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite
bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a --2 penalty on attacks
with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of
+0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made
with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average
Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to
damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of
Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.

For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite
longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.

### Longspear
A longspear has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet
away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a
ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double damage
on a successful hit against a charging character.

### Net
A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you
make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is
10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature
takes a --2 penalty on attack rolls and a --4 penalty on Dexterity, can
move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the
trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding
it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope
allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make
a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a
full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC
25 Strength check (also a full-round action).

A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.

A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw
your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After
the net is unfolded, you take a --4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It
takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long
for a nonproficient one to do so.

### Nunchaku
The nunchaku is a special monk weapon. This designation
gives a monk wielding a nunchaku special options. With a nunchaku, you
get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy
(including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).

### Quarterstaff
A quarterstaff is a double weapon. You can fight with
it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the
normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just
as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature
wielding a quarterstaff in one hand can't use it as a double
weapon---only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

The quarterstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk
wielding a quarterstaff special options.

### Ranseur
A ranseur has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away
with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

With a ranseur, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to
disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such
an attempt fails).

### Rapier
You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity
modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a rapier
sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you. You can't
wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength
bonus to damage.

### Sai
With a sai, you get a +4 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to
disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an
attempt fails).

The sai is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding
a sai special options.

### Scythe
A scythe can be used to make trip attacks. If you are
tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the scythe to avoid
being tripped.

### Shield, Heavy or Light
You can bash with a shield instead of using
it for defense. See Armor for details.

### Shortbow
You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of
its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty
for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If
you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls
when you use a composite shortbow (see below) but not a regular
shortbow.

### Shortbow, Composite
You need at least two hands to use a bow,
regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted.
All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is,
each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If
your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite
bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a --2 penalty on attacks
with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of
+0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made
with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average
Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to
damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of
Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost.

For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite
shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.

### Shortspear
A shortspear is small enough to wield one-handed. It may
also be thrown.

### Shuriken
A shuriken is a special monk weapon. This designation
gives a monk wielding shuriken special options. A shuriken can't be used
as a melee weapon.

Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for
the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special
versions of them and what happens to them after they are thrown.

### Siangham
The siangham is a special monk weapon. This designation
gives a monk wielding a siangham special options.

### Sickle
A sickle can be used to make trip attacks. If you are
tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sickle to avoid
being tripped.

### Sling
Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a
sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a
sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two
hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense
or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the
weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you
and you take a --1 penalty on attack rolls.

### Spear
A spear can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a
spear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit
against a charging character.

### Spiked Armor
You can outfit your armor with spikes, which can deal
damage in a grapple or as a separate attack. See Armor for details.

### Spiked Shield, Heavy or Light
You can bash with a spiked shield
instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.

### Strike, Unarmed
A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal
damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of
nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed
Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at
her option. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon
damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon
damage rolls.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you
can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead
of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.

### Sword, Bastard
A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand
without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can
use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.

### Sword, Two-Bladed
A two-bladed sword is a double weapon. You can
fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur
all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two
weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light
weapon. A creature wielding a two-bladed sword in one hand can't use it
as a double weapon---only one end of the weapon can be used in any given
round.

### Trident
This weapon can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set
a trident against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit
against a charging character.

### Urgrosh, Dwarven
A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon. You can
fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur
all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two
weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light
weapon. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8
points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6
points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The
other is the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a dwarven urgrosh in
one hand can't use it as a double weapon---only one end of the weapon
can be used in any given round.

If you use a ready action to set an urgrosh against a charge, you deal
double damage if you score a hit against a charging character. If you
use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part
of the weapon that deals damage.

Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.

### Waraxe, Dwarven
A dwarven waraxe is too large to use in one hand
without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium
character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a
Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a
dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.

### Whip
A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage to any
creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of
+3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach,
though you don't threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In
addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against
foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).

Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used
a ranged weapon.

You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your
own trip attempt, you can drop the whip to avoid being tripped.

When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to
disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if
the attack fails).

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier
instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for
you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.

### Masterwork Weapons

A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon.
Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

You can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it
must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the Craft skill). The
masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp
to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork
quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).

Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The
enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any
enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.

All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork
quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn't
stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon's magic.

Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you
can't create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an
enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields
have lessened armor check penalties.

## Armor

### Armor Qualities

To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor
Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with
the armors that work best for them.

Armor and shields can take damage from some types of attacks.

Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on Table:
Armor and Shields, below).

### Cost
The cost of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid creatures.
See Armor for Unusual Creatures, below, for armor prices for other
creatures.

### Armor/Shield Bonus
Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while
shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor
doesn't stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus.
Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn't stack with other
effects that grant a shield bonus.

### Maximum Dex Bonus
This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC
that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing
the wearer's ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn't affect any
other Dexterity-related abilities.

Even if a character's Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor,
this situation does not count as losing a Dexterity bonus to AC.

Your character's encumbrance (the amount of gear he or she carries) may
also restrict the maximum Dexterity bonus that can be applied to his or
her Armor Class.

*Shields:* Shields do not affect a character's maximum Dexterity bonus.

### Armor Check Penalty
Any armor heavier than leather hurts a
character's ability to use some skills. An armor check penalty number is
the penalty that applies to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump,
Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks by a character wearing
a certain kind of armor. Double the normal armor check penalty is
applied to Swim checks. A character's encumbrance (the amount of gear
carried, including armor) may also apply an armor check penalty.

*Shields:* If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both
armor check penalties apply.

*Nonproficient with Armor Worn:* A character who wears armor and/or uses
a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the armor's
(and/or shield's) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all
Strength-based and Dexterity-based ability and skill checks. The penalty
for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency
with shields.

*Sleeping in Armor:* A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is
automatically fatigued the next day. He or she takes a --2 penalty on
Strength and Dexterity and can't charge or run. Sleeping in light armor
does not cause fatigue.

### Arcane Spell Failure
Armor interferes with the gestures that a
spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic
component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell
failure if they're wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor without
incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.

*Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor:* A character who casts an arcane
spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure
roll. The number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table:
Armor and Shields is the chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If
the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no
chance of arcane spell failure.

*Shields:* If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the
two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.

### Speed
Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on
Table: Armor and Shields is the character's speed while wearing the
armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered
speed of 30 feet.

They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an
unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the second column. Remember,
however, that a dwarf 's land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or
heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

*Shields:* Shields do not affect a character's speed.

### Weight
This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium
wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor
for Large characters weighs twice as much.

  : Table: Armor and Shields

### Armor Descriptions

Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on
Table: Armor and Shields are described below.

### Armor Spikes
You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow
you to deal extra piercing damage (see Table: Weapons) on a successful
grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not
proficient with them, you take a --4 penalty on grapple checks when you
try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand
attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case.
(You can't also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already
made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.)

An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes'
effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their
own right.

### Banded Mail
The suit includes gauntlets.

### Breastplate
It comes with a helmet and greaves.

### Buckler
This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm.
You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can
also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an
off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed
weapon), but you take a --1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This
penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand
and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in
your off hand, you don't get the buckler's AC bonus for the rest of the
round.

You can't bash someone with a buckler.

### Chain Shirt
A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.

### Chainmail
The suit includes gauntlets.

### Full Plate
The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a
visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the
armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner
by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a
new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4x100) gold pieces.

### Gauntlet, Locked
This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces
that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it
cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus on any roll made to
keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked
gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round
action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given
applies only if you're wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor.
Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as
part of the armor.

While the gauntlet is locked, you can't use the hand wearing it for
casting spells or employing skills. (You can still cast spells with
somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.)

Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage
rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike.

### Half-Plate
The suit includes gauntlets.

### Scale Mail
The suit includes gauntlets.

### Shield, Heavy, Wooden or Steel
You strap a shield to your forearm
and grip it with your hand. A heavy shield is so heavy that you can't
use your shield hand for anything else.

*Wooden or Steel:* Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic
protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.

*Shield Bash Attacks:* You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield,
using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage dealt
by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning
weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy
shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you
lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round).
An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a
shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon
in its own right.

### Shield, Light, Wooden or Steel
You strap a shield to your forearm
and grip it with your hand. A light shield's weight lets you carry other
items in that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it.

*Wooden or Steel:* Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic
protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.

*Shield Bash Attacks:* You can bash an opponent with a light shield,
using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage dealt
by a shield bash. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning
weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light
shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose
its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An
enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a
shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon
in its own right.

### Shield, Tower
This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as you
are. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your
AC. However, you can instead use it as total cover, though you must give
up your attacks to do so. The shield does not, however, provide cover
against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by
targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower
shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.

When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a --2 penalty on
attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance.

### Shield Spikes
When added to your shield, these spikes turn it into
a martial piercing weapon that increases the damage dealt by a shield
bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category
larger than you. You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield.
Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash
attack (see above).

An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the
effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a spiked shield can be
made into a magic weapon in its own right.

### Splint Mail
The suit includes gauntlets.

### Masterwork Armor

Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of
armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal
version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.

A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and
above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.

The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a
bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as
a weapon.

All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of
masterwork quality.

You can't add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is
created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.

### Armor for Unusual Creatures

Armor and shields for unusually big creatures, unusually little
creatures, and nonhumanoid creatures have different costs and weights
from those given on Table: Armor and Shields. Refer to the appropriate
line on the table below and apply the multipliers to cost and weight for
the armor type in question.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time required to don armor depends on its type; see Table: Donning
Armor.

### Don
This column tells how long it takes a character to put the
armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is
only a move action.

### Don Hastily
This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on
in a hurry. The armor check penalty and armor bonus for hastily donned
armor are each 1 point worse than normal.

### Remove
This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off.
Loosing a shield (removing it from the arm and dropping it) is only a
move action.

  1 If the character has some help, cut this time in half. A single character doing nothing else can help one or two adjacent characters. Two characters can't help each other don armor at the same time.                                  
  2 The wearer must have help to don this armor. Without help, it can be donned only hastily.

: Table: Goods and Services

### Adventuring Gear

few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services
are described below, along with any special benefits they confer on the
user ("you").

### Caltrops
A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one
prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter
caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are
at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops
covers an area 5 feet square.

Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a
round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one.
The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the
creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection
bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other
footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the
attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of
damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by one-half because its foot
is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the
creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it
receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or running
creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature
moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of
caltrops with no trouble.

Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.

### Candle
A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1
hour.

### Chain
Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with
a DC 26 Strength check.

### Crowbar
A crowbar it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength
checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a
one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that
of a club of its size.

### Flint and Steel
Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a
full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least
that long.

### Grappling Hook
Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a
Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).

### Hammer
If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed
improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a
spiked gauntlet of its size.

### Ink
This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it
costs twice as much.

### Jug, Clay
This basic ceramic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds
1 gallon of liquid.

### Lamp, Common
A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides
shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a
pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.

### Lantern, Bullseye
A bullseye lantern provides clear illumination in
a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone. It burns for
6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.

### Lantern, Hooded
A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 30-foot
radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It burns
for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one
hand.

### Lock
The DC to open a lock with the Open Lock skill depends on the
lock's quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or
superior (DC 40).

### Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork
Manacles can bind a Medium
creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip
free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles
requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles).
Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.

Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost
of the manacles.

For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.

For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and
for a Huge creature, one hundred times this amount. Gargantuan,
Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by
specially made manacles.

### Oil
A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern. You can use a
flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist's fire,
except that it takes a full round action to prepare a flask with a fuse.
Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting
successfully.

You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square,
provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds
and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.

### Ram, Portable
This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2
circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and it
allows a second person to help you without having to roll, increasing
your bonus by 2.

### Rope, Hempen
This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC
23 Strength check.

### Rope, Silk
This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DC 24
Strength check. It is so supple that it provides a +2 circumstance bonus
on Use Rope checks.

### Spyglass
Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice
their size.

### Torch
A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20-foot
radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 40- foot radius. If a
torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that
deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1
point of fire damage.

### Vial
A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The stoppered container
usually is no more than 1 inch wide and 3 inches high.

### Special Substances and Items

Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water
can be made by a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill.

### Acid
You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this
attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A
direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet
of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the
splash.

### Alchemist's Fire
You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a
splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range
increment of 10 feet.

A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5
feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from
the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an
additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a
full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this
additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex
save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save.
Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically
smothers the fire.

### Antitoxin
If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on
Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.

### Everburning Torch
This otherwise normal torch has a *continual
flame* spell cast upon it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a
20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot
radius.

### Holy Water
Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders
almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a
splash weapon.

Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10
feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature,
but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask
and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an
incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it.
Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity.

A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an
undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of
the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.

Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).

### Smokestick
This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates
thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10- foot cube (treat
the effect as a *fog cloud* spell, except that a moderate or stronger
wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1
round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.

### Sunrod
This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when
struck. It clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy
illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the
gold tip is burned out and worthless.

### Tanglefoot Bag
When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a
ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes
apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming
tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a
--2 penalty on attack rolls and a --4 penalty to Dexterity and must make
a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a
successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger
creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not
stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to
fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A
tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.

A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free
by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to
the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off
itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack
roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit
makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once
free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A
character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC
15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and
fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness.
An application of *universal solvent* to a stuck creature dissolves the
alchemical goo immediately.

### Thunderstone
You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a
range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck
hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack.
Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude
save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the
obvious effects, takes a --4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance
to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to
cast.

Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a
particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5.

### Tindertwig
The alchemical substance on the end of this small,
wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a
flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint
and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a
tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and
lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

### Tools and Skill Kits

### Alchemist's Lab
An alchemist's lab always has the perfect tool for
making alchemical items, so it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft
(alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the Craft
(alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy)
skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to
get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.

### Artisan's Tools
These special tools include the items needed to
pursue any craft. Without them, you have to use improvised tools (--2
penalty on Craft checks), if you can do the job at all.

### Artisan's Tools, Masterwork
These tools serve the same purpose as
artisan's tools (above), but masterwork artisan's tools are the perfect
tools for the job, so you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft checks
made with them.

### Climber's Kit
This is the perfect tool for climbing and gives you a
+2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.

### Disguise Kit
The kit is the perfect tool for disguise and provides
a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. A disguise kit is exhausted
after ten uses.

### Healer's Kit
It is the perfect tool for healing and provides a +2
circumstance bonus on Heal checks. A healer's kit is exhausted after ten
uses.

### Holy Symbol, Silver or Wooden
A holy symbol focuses positive
energy. A cleric or paladin uses it as the focus for his spells and as a
tool for turning undead. Each religion has its own holy symbol.

*Unholy Symbols:* An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it
focuses negative energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral
clerics who want to cast evil spells or command undead).

### Magnifying Glass
This simple lens allows a closer look at small
objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when
starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light
as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a
full-round action. A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on
Appraise checks

involving any item that is small or highly detailed.

### Musical Instrument, Common or Masterwork
A masterwork instrument
grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks involving its use.

### Scale, Merchant's
A scale grants a +2 circumstance bonus on
Appraise checks involving items that are valued by weight, including
anything made of precious metals.

### Spell Component Pouch
A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is
assumed to have all the material components and focuses needed for
spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost,
divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch.

### Spellbook, Wizard's (Blank)
A spellbook has 100 pages of parchment,
and each spell takes up one page per spell level (one page each for
0-level spells).

### Thieves' Tools
This kit contains the tools you need to use the
Disable Device and Open Lock skills. Without these tools, you must
improvise tools, and you take a --2 circumstance penalty on Disable
Device and Open Locks checks.

### Thieves' Tools, Masterwork
This kit contains extra tools and tools
of better make, which grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Disable Device
and Open Lock checks.

### Tool, Masterwork
This well-made item is the perfect tool for the
job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if
any). Bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items used toward the same
skill check do not stack.

### Water Clock
This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurate
to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a
source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the
regulated flow of droplets of water.

### Clothing

### Artisan's Outfit
This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt
or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also
include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.

### Cleric's Vestments
These ecclesiastical clothes are for performing
priestly functions, not for adventuring.

### Cold Weather Outfit
A cold weather outfit includes a wool coat,
linen shirt, wool cap, heavy cloak, thick pants or skirt, and

boots. This outfit grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving
throws against exposure to cold weather.

### Courtier's Outfit
This outfit includes fancy, tailored clothes in
whatever fashion happens to be the current style in the courts of the
nobles. Anyone trying to influence nobles or courtiers while wearing
street dress will have a hard time of it (--2 penalty on Charisma-based
skill checks to influence such individuals). If you wear this outfit
without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an
out-of-place commoner.

### Entertainer's Outfit
This set of flashy, perhaps even gaudy,
clothes is for entertaining. While the outfit looks whimsical, its
practical design lets you tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or just run
(if the audience turns ugly).

### Explorer's Outfit
This is a full set of clothes for someone who
never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches
or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and
a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn
over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the
cloak). The outfit also includes any extra items you might need, such as
a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.

### Monk's Outfit
This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches,
and a loose shirt, and is all bound together with sashes. The outfit is
designed to give you maximum mobility, and it's made of high-quality
fabric. You can hide small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and
the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes.

### Noble's Outfit
This set of clothes is designed specifically to be
expensive and to show it. Precious metals and gems are worked into the
clothing. To fit into the noble crowd, every would-be noble also needs a
signet ring (see Adventuring Gear, above) and jewelry (worth at least
100 gp).

### Peasant's Outfit
This set of clothes consists of a loose shirt and
baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings
are used for shoes.

### Royal Outfit
This is just the clothing, not the royal scepter,
crown, ring, and other accoutrements. Royal clothes are ostentatious,
with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.

### Scholar's Outfit
Perfect for a scholar, this outfit includes a
robe, a belt, a cap, soft shoes, and possibly a cloak.

### Traveler's Outfit
This set of clothes consists of boots, a wool
skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or
jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.

### Food, Drink, and Lodging

### Inn
Poor accommodations at an inn amount to a place on the floor
near the hearth. Common accommodations consist of a place on a raised,
heated floor, the use of a blanket and a pillow. Good accommodations
consist of a small, private room with one bed, some amenities, and a
covered chamber pot in the corner.

### Meals
Poor meals might be composed of bread, baked turnips, onions,
and water. Common meals might consist of bread, chicken stew, carrots,
and watered-down ale or wine. Good meals might be composed of bread and
pastries, beef, peas, and ale or wine.

### Mounts and Related Gear

### Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature
Barding is a type of
armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a
horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides
better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed.
Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and
Shields.

Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as
much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs
twice as much as the armor found on Table: Armor and Shields (see Armor
for Unusual Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium
mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium
armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that
wears it, as shown on the table below.

Flying mounts can't fly in medium or heavy barding.

Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures
given on Table: Donning Armor. A barded animal cannot be used to carry
any load other than the rider and normal saddlebags.

### Dog, Riding
This Medium dog is specially trained to carry a Small
humanoid rider. It is brave in combat like a warhorse. You take no
damage when you fall from a riding dog.

### Donkey or Mule
Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger,
hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast
distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not
eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.

### Feed
Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain
themselves, but providing feed for them is much better. If you have a
riding dog, you have to feed it at least some meat.

### Horse
A horse (other than a pony) is suitable as a mount for a
human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse
and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.

Warhorses and warponies can be ridden easily into combat. Light horses,
ponies, and heavy horses are hard to control in combat.

### Saddle, Exotic
An exotic saddle is like a normal saddle of the same
sort except that it is designed for an unusual mount. Exotic saddles
come in military, pack, and riding styles.

### Saddle, Military
A military saddle braces the rider, providing a +2
circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. If
you're knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, you have a 75%
chance to stay in the saddle (compared to 50% for a riding saddle).

### Saddle, Pack
A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a
rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.

### Saddle, Riding
The standard riding saddle supports a rider.

### Transport

### Carriage
This four-wheeled vehicle can transport as many as four
people within an enclosed cab, plus two drivers. In general, two horses
(or other beasts of burden) draw it. A carriage comes with the harness
needed to pull it.

### Cart
This two-wheeled vehicle can be drawn by a single horse (or
other beast of burden). It comes with a harness.

### Galley
This three-masted ship has seventy oars on either side and
requires a total crew of 200. A galley is 130 feet long and 20 feet
wide, and it can carry 150 tons of cargo or 250 soldiers. For 8,000 gp
more, it can be fitted with a ram and castles with firing platforms
fore, aft, and amidships. This ship cannot make sea voyages and sticks
to the coast. It moves about 4 miles per hour when being rowed or under
sail.

### Keelboat
This 50- to 75-foot-long ship is 15 to 20 feet wide and
has a few oars to supplement its single mast with a square sail. It has
a crew of eight to fifteen and can carry 40 to 50 tons of cargo or 100
soldiers. It can make sea voyages, as well as sail down rivers (thanks
to its flat bottom). It moves about 1 mile per hour.

### Longship
This 75-foot-long ship with forty oars requires a total
crew of 50. It has a single mast and a square sail, and it can carry 50
tons of cargo or 120 soldiers. A longship can make sea voyages. It moves
about 3 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.

### Rowboat
This 8- to 12-foot-long boat holds two or three Medium
passengers. It moves about 1-1/2 miles per hour.

### Sailing Ship
This larger, seaworthy ship is 75 to 90 feet long and
20 feet wide and has a crew of 20. It can carry 150 tons of cargo. It
has square sails on its two masts and can make sea voyages. It moves
about 2 miles per hour.

### Sled
This is a wagon on runners for moving through snow and over
ice. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A sled
comes with the harness needed to pull it.

### Wagon
This is a four-wheeled, open vehicle for transporting heavy
loads. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A
wagon comes with the harness needed to pull it.

### Warship
This 100-foot-long ship has a single mast, although oars
can also propel it. It has a crew of 60 to 80 rowers. This ship can
carry 160 soldiers, but not for long distances, since there isn't room
for supplies to support that many people. The warship cannot make sea
voyages and sticks to the coast. It is not used for cargo. It moves
about 2-1/2 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.

### Spellcasting and Services

Sometimes the best solution for a problem is to hire someone else to
take care of it.

### Coach Cab
The price given is for a ride in a coach that transports
people (and light cargo) between towns. For a ride in a cab that
transports passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you
anywhere you need to go.

### Hireling, Trained
The amount given is the typical daily wage for
mercenary warriors, masons, craftsmen, scribes, teamsters, and other
trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such
hirelings require significantly higher pay.

### Hireling, Untrained
The amount shown is the typical daily wage for
laborers, porters, cooks, maids, and other menial workers.

### Messenger
This entry includes horse-riding messengers and runners.
Those willing to carry a message to a place they were going anyway may
ask for only half the indicated amount.

### Road or Gate Toll
A toll is sometimes charged to cross a
well-trodden, well-kept, and well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it
and for its upkeep. Occasionally, a large walled city charges a toll to
enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).

### Ship's Passage
Most ships do not specialize in passengers, but many
have the capability to take a few along when transporting cargo. Double
the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are
otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.

### Spell
The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a
spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go
to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his or her convenience
(generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to
prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster
somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him or her, and the
default answer is no.

The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or
focus component and no XP cost. If the spell includes a material
component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.

If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10
the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell. If the spell has an XP
cost, add 5 gp per XP lost.

Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will
certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any
such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to
cast such a spell, which isn't certain). In the case of spells that
transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely
have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren't returning
with the caster.

In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient
level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or
larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster
capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells,
a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or
6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a
metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast
9th-level spells.
