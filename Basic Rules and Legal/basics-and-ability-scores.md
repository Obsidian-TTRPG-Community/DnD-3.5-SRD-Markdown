# THE BASICS

### The Core Mechanic
Whenever you attempt an action that has some
chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20). To determine if
your character succeeds at a task you do this:

-   Roll a d20.
-   Add any relevant modifiers.
-   Compare the result to a target number.

If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character
succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.

## Dice

Dice rolls are described with expressions such as "3d4+3," which means
"roll three four-sided dice and add 3" (resulting in a number between 6
and 15). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the
results together). The number immediately after the "d" tells you the
type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is
added or subtracted from the result.

### d%
Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number
between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One
(designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones
digit. Two 0s represent 100.

## Rounding Fractions

In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the
fraction is one-half or larger.

*Exception:* Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a
minimum of 1.

## Multiplying

Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as
you're applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When
two or more multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier
or a die roll), however, combine them into a single multiple, with each
extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus,
a double (×2) and a double (×2) applied to the same number results in a
triple (×3, because 2 + 1 = 3).

When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or
distance), normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size
doubles (thus multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone
(which would multiply its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs
about 24 times normal, not 10 times normal. Similarly, a blinded
creature attempting to negotiate difficult terrain would count each
square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for a total multiplier of
×4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice).

## Ability Scores

### Ability Modifiers

Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging
from --5 to +5. Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells shows the
modifier for each score. It also shows bonus spells, which you'll need
to know about if your character is a spellcaster.

The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character
tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier
with some numbers that aren't die rolls. A positive modifier is called a
bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.

-   Melee attack rolls.
-   Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (including
    a sling). (*Exceptions:* Off-hand attacks receive only one-half the
    character's Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive one and
    a half times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a
    bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite
    bow.)
-   Climb, Jump, and Swim checks. These are the skills that have
    Strength as their key ability.
-   Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).

### Dexterity (Dex)

Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and
balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues, but it's
also high on the list for characters who typically wear light or medium
armor (rangers and barbarians) or no armor at all (monks, wizards, and
sorcerers), and for anyone who wants to be a skilled archer.

You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:

-   Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows,
    crossbows, throwing axes, and other ranged weapons.
-   Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the
    attack.
-   Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that
    you can escape by moving quickly.
-   Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Ride,
    Sleight of Hand, Tumble, and Use Rope checks. These are the skills
    that have Dexterity as their key ability.

### Constitution (Con)

Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A
Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is
important for all classes.

You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:

-   Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result
    below 1---that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point
    each time he or she advances in level).
-   Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison and similar threats.
-   Concentration checks. Concentration is a skill, important to
    spellcasters, that has Constitution as its key ability.

If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her
Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or
decrease accordingly.

### Intelligence (Int)

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This
ability is important for wizards because it affects how many spells they
can cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how powerful their
spells can be. It's also important for any character who wants to have a
wide assortment of skills.

You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:

-   The number of languages your character knows at the start of the
    game.
-   The number of skill points gained each level. (But your character
    always gets at least 1 skill point per level.)
-   Appraise, Craft, Decipher Script, Disable Device, Forgery,
    Knowledge, Search, and Spellcraft checks. These are the skills that
    have Intelligence as their key ability.

A wizard gains bonus spells based on her Intelligence score. The minimum
Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell's
level.

An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A creature of humanlike
intelligence has a score of at least 3.

### Wisdom (Wis)

Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and
intuition. While Intelligence represents one's ability to analyze
information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's
surroundings. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and
druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want
your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every
creature has a Wisdom score.

You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:

-   Will saving throws (for negating the effect of charm person and
    other spells).
-   Heal, Listen, Profession, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks.
    These are the skills that have Wisdom as their key ability.

Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers get bonus spells based on their
Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid,
paladin, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.

### Charisma (Cha)

Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness,
personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This
ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is
perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for
paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since
it affects their ability to turn undead. Every creature has a Charisma
score.

You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:

-   Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Handle Animal,
    Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks. These are the
    skills that have Charisma as their key ability.
-   Checks that represent attempts to influence others.
-   Turning checks for clerics and paladins attempting to turn zombies,
    vampires, and other undead.

Sorcerers and bards get bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The
minimum Charisma score needed to cast a sorcerer or bard spell is 10 +
the spell's level.

When an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score
change accordingly. A character does not retroactively get additional
skill points for previous levels if she increases her intelligence.
