# SKILLS II

## Heal [(Wis)]

### Check
The DC and effect depend on the task you attempt.

  ------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------
  Task Heal                                                     DC
  First aid                                                     15
  Long-term care                                                15
  Treat wound from caltrop, *spike growth,* or *spike stones*   15
  Treat poison                                                  Poison's save DC
  Treat disease                                                 Disease's save DC
  ------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------

*First Aid:* You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a
character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate
of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her
stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.

*Long-Term Care:* Providing long-term care means treating a wounded
person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient
recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at
twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest
in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest;
2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability
score points for each full day of complete rest.

You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and
supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in
settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the
healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.

*Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:* A creature
wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A
successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.

A creature wounded by a *spike growth* or *spike stones* spell must
succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by
one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10
minutes to dress the victim's injuries and succeeding on a Heal check
against the spell's save DC.

*Treat Poison:* To treat poison means to tend a single character who has
been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or
suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a
saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned
character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever
is higher.

*Treat Disease:* To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased
character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease
effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check
result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.

### Action
Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is
a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a
*spike growth* or *spike stones* spell takes 10 minutes of work.
Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.

### Try Again
Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try a Heal check
again without proof of the original check's failure. You can always
retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous
attempt is still alive.

### Special
A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus
on Heal checks.

A healer's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.

## Hide [(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)]

### Check
Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who
might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at
no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than
your normal speed, you take a --5 penalty. It's practically impossible
(--20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.

A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty
on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12,
Tiny +8, Small +4, Large --4, Huge --8, Gargantuan --12, Colossal --16.

You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total
cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below)
obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.

If people are observing you, even casually, you can't hide. You can run
around a corner or behind cover so that you're out of sight and then
hide, but the others then know at least where you went.

If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check;
see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their
attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a
hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has
to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is
made at a --10 penalty because you have to move fast.

*Sniping:* If you've already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from
your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide
again. You take a --20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself
after the shot.

*Creating a Diversion to Hide:* You can use Bluff to help you hide. A
successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to
attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.

### Action
Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of
movement, so it doesn't take a separate action. However, hiding
immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.

### Special
If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks
if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you're moving.

If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.

A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural
terrain, even if it doesn't grant cover or concealment. A 17thlevel
ranger can do this even while being observed.

## Intimidate [(Cha)]

### Check
You can change another's behavior with a successful check.
Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check
(1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus \[if any\] +
target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's
check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the
purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the
target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited
help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy
skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the
target remains in your presence, and for 1d6Ã—10 minutes afterward. After
this time, the target's default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly
(or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).

If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with
incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.

*Demoralize Opponent:* You can also use Intimidate to weaken an
opponent's resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed
by the target's modified level check (see above). If you win, the target
becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a --2 penalty on
attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can intimidate only
an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.

### Action
Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 minute of
interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action.

### Try Again
Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do
not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be
intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn't help. If the initial check
fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to
resist the intimidator, and a retry is futile.

### Special
You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size
category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a
--4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you
are smaller than your target.

A character immune to fear can't be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent
creatures.

If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate
checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on
Intimidate checks.

## Jump [(Str; Armor Check Penalty)]

### Check
The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the
type of jump you are attempting (see below).

Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then
no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less
than 30 feet, you take a --6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less
than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus
for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.

All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which
requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before
attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the
jump is doubled.

Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum
movement in a round.

If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on
your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you
land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.

*Long Jump:* A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a
chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical
height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the
jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).

If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you
fail the check by less than 5, you don't clear the distance, but you can
make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your
movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm
or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------
  Long Jump Distance                                                            Jump DC^1^
  5 feet                                                                        5

  15 feet                                                                       15

  25 feet                                                                       25
  30 feet                                                                       30
  1 Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.   
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------

*High Jump:* A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high
above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the
distance to be cleared.

If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that
you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can
do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump
check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the
same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled
if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------
  High Jump Distance^1^                                                         Jump DC^2^

  1 Not including vertical reach; see below.                                    
  2 Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.   
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------

Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to
the size of the character or creature. The maximum vertical reach
(height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature
of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a
typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)

Quadrupedal creatures don't have the same vertical reach as a bipedal
creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.

  --------------- ----------------
  Creature Size   Vertical Reach
  Colossal        128 ft.
  Gargantuan      64 ft.
  Huge            32 ft.
  Large           16 ft.
  Medium          8 ft.
  Small           4 ft.
  Tiny            2 ft.
  Diminutive      1 ft.
  Fine            1/2 ft.
  --------------- ----------------

*Hop Up:* You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as
a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10
feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet,
then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to
hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.

*Jumping Down:* If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less
damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a
height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so
the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.

If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had
dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.

### Action
None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is
part of a move action. If you run out of movement mid-jump, your next
action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be
a move action to complete the jump.

### Special
Effects that increase your movement also increase your
jumping distance, since your check is modified by your speed.

If you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on Jump checks for any
jumps made after a running start.

A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because halflings are
agile and athletic.

If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus
on Jump checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble
checks.

## Knowledge [(Int; Trained Only)]

Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a
number of unrelated skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of
lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.

Below are listed typical fields of study.

-   Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic
    phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)
-   Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges,
    fortifications)
-   Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)
-   Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)
-   History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)
-   Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs,
    traditions, humanoids)
-   Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons
    and cycles, weather, vermin)
-   Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes,
    personalities)
-   Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic
    tradition, holy symbols, undead)
-   The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane,
    the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the
    planes)

### Check
Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of
10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30
(for really tough questions).

In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their
special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check
equals 10 + the monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember
a bit of useful information about that monster.

For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall
another piece of useful information.

### Action
Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check
doesn't take an action---you simply know the answer or you don't.

### Try Again
No. The check represents what you know, and thinking
about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you
never learned in the first place.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get
a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering),
you get a +2 bonus on Search checks made to find secret doors or hidden
compartments.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus
on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural
hazards.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a +2 bonus
on bardic knowledge checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on
Gather Information checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on
Survival checks made in aboveground natural environments (aquatic,
desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, or plains).

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and royalty), you get
a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a +2 bonus
on turning checks against undead.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2
bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2
bonus on Survival checks made while underground.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge
(nature) checks.

### Untrained
An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence
check. Without actual training, you know only common knowledge (DC 10 or
lower).

## Listen [(Wis)]

### Check
Your Listen check is either made against a DC that reflects
how quiet the noise is that you might hear, or it is opposed by your
target's Move Silently check.

  -------------------- -------------------------

In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the table
could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the indicated
DC would be their average check result.

### Action
Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear something in a
reactive manner (such as when someone makes a noise or you move into a
new area), you can make a Listen check without using an action. Trying
to hear something you failed to hear previously is a move action.

### Try Again
Yes. You can try to hear something that you failed to
hear previously with no penalty.

### Special
When several characters are listening to the same thing, a
single 1d20 roll can be used for all the individuals' Listen checks.

A fascinated creature takes a --4 penalty on Listen checks made as
reactions.

If you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Listen checks.

A ranger gains a bonus on Listen checks when using this skill against a
favored enemy.

An elf, gnome, or halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.

A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Listen checks..

A sleeping character may make Listen checks at a --10 penalty. A
successful check awakens the sleeper.

## Move Silently [(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)]

### Check
Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of
anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed
at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less
than your full speed, you take a --5 penalty. It's practically
impossible (--20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.

Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently
across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty
on your Move Silently check as indicated below.

  --------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------
  Surface                                                         Check Modifier
  Noisy (scree, shallow or deep bog, undergrowth, dense rubble)   --2
  Very noisy (dense undergrowth, deep snow)                       --5
  --------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------

**Action:**None. A Move Silently check is included in your movement or
other activity, so it is part of another action.

### Special
The master of a cat familiar gains a +3 bonus on Move
Silently checks.

A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Move Silently
checks.

## Open Lock [(Dex; Trained Only)]

Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves' tools imposes a
--2 circumstance penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is
employed. If you use masterwork thieves' tools, you gain a +2
circumstance bonus on the check.

### Check
The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40, depending on
the quality of the lock, as given on the table below.

  ------------------ ---- -------------- ----
  Lock               DC   Lock           DC
  Very simple lock   20   Good lock      30
  Average lock       25   Amazing lock   40
  ------------------ ---- -------------- ----

### Action
Opening a lock is a full-round action.

### Special
If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on
Open Lock checks.

### Untrained
You cannot pick locks untrained, but you might
successfully force them open.

## Perform [(Cha)]

Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of
separate skills.

You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks, each
purchased as a separate skill.

Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of
methods, instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided
for each category below.

-   Act (comedy, drama, mime)
-   Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
-   Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
-   Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
-   Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
-   Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
-   String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
-   Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)
-   Sing (ballad, chant, melody)

### Check
You can impress audiences with your talent and skill.

  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perform DC   Performance
  10           Routine performance. Trying to earn money by playing in public is essentially begging. You can earn 1d10 cp/day.
  15           Enjoyable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d10 sp/day.
  20           Great performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d10 sp/day. In time, you may be invited to join a professional troupe and may develop a regional reputation.
  25           Memorable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d6 gp/day. In time, you may come to the attention of noble patrons and develop a national reputation.
  30           Extraordinary performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d6 gp/day. In time, you may draw attention from distant potential patrons, or even from extraplanar beings.
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on
Perform checks that involve its use.

### Action
Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires
anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's
special Perform-based abilities are described in that class's
description.

### Try Again
Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous
failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is
likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by
2 for each previous failure.)

### Special
A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to
inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his
*fascinate* ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire
competence, 9 ranks to use his *suggestion* ability, 12 ranks to inspire
greatness, 15 ranks to use his *song of freedom* ability, 18 ranks to
inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his *mass suggestion* ability. See
Bardic Music in the bard class description.

In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with
sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells (especially
illusions).

## Profession [(Wis; Trained Only)]

Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession is actually a number of
separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its
own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. While a Craft skill
represents ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill
represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less
specific knowledge.

### Check
You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning
about half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of
dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to
perform the profession's daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how
to handle common problems.

### Action
Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week
of work.

### Try Again
Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an
income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your
check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to
determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to
accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.

### Untrained
Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters
without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per
day.

## Ride [(Dex)]

If you attempt to ride a creature that is ill suited as a mount, you
take a --5 penalty on your Ride checks.

### Check
Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle,
mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.

The following tasks do require checks.

  -------------------------------- --------- ------------------------- ---------
  Task                             Ride DC   Task                      Ride DC
  Guide with knees                 5         Leap                      15
  Stay in saddle                   5         Spur mount                15
  Fight with warhorse              10        Control mount in battle   20
  Cover                            15        Fast mount or dismount    20^1^
  Soft fall                        15                                  
  1 Armor check penalty applies.                                       
  -------------------------------- --------- ------------------------- ---------

*Guide with Knees:* You can react instantly to guide your mount with
your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride
check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand
this round because you need to use the other to control your mount.

*Stay in Saddle:* You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when
your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This
usage does not take an action.

*Fight with Warhorse:* If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in
battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This
usage is a free action.

*Cover:* You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your
mount, using it as cover. You can't attack or cast spells while using
your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don't get the
cover benefit. This usage does not take an action.

*Soft Fall:* You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you
fall off a mount---when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If
you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This
usage does not take an action.

*Leap:* You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its
movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount's Jump modifier, whichever
is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride
check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate
falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an
action, but is part of the mount's movement.

*Spur Mount:* You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move
action. A successful Ride check increases the mount's speed by 10 feet
for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use
this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed
deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points,
4 points, 8 points, and so on).

*Control Mount in Battle:* As a move action, you can attempt to control
a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat
riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing
else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.

*Fast Mount or Dismount:* You can attempt to mount or dismount from a
mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action,
provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you
fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can't
use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger
than yourself.

### Action
Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action.
Other checks are a move action, a free action, or no action at all, as
noted above.

### Special
If you are riding bareback, you take a --5 penalty on Ride
checks.

If your mount has a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance bonus on
Ride checks related to staying in the saddle.

The Ride skill is a prerequisite for the feats Mounted Archery, Mounted
Combat, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge,

Trample.

If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2
bonus on Ride checks.

## Search [(Int)]

### Check
You generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface
to be searched. The table below gives DCs for typical tasks involving
the Search skill.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------
  Task                                                                                                                                                                                Search DC

  1 Dwarves (even if they are not rogues) can use Search to find traps built into or out of stone.                                                                                    
  2 A successful Search check can find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage, but it won't let you find or follow a trail. See the Track feat for the appropriate DC.   
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------

### Action
It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot
area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side.

### Special
An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Search checks, and a
half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a half-elf) who simply
passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can make a Search
check to find that door.

If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks.

The spells *explosive runes, fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol,* and
*teleportation circle* create magic traps that a rogue can find by
making a successful Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using
Disable Device. Identifying the location of a *snare* spell has a DC of
23. *Spike growth* and *spike stones* create magic traps that can be
found using Search, but against which Disable Device checks do not
succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.

Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or
more create barely visible energy fluctuations. These fluctuations give
you a +4 bonus on Search checks to locate such abjuration spells.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus
on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering),
you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to find secret doors or hidden
compartments.

### Restriction
While anyone can use Search to find a trap whose DC is
20 or lower, only a rogue can use Search to locate traps with higher
DCs. (*Exception:* The spell *find traps* temporarily enables a cleric
to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)

A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill to find a
difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is built into
or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search check from his
stonecunning ability.

## Sense Motive [(Wis)]

### Check
A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed (see the
Bluff skill). You can also use this skill to determine when "something
is up" (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone's
trustworthiness.

  ------------------------ -----------------
  Task                     Sense Motive DC
  Hunch                    20
  Sense enchantment        25 or 15
  Discern secret message   Varies
  ------------------------ -----------------

*Hunch:* This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the
social situation. You can get the feeling from another's behavior that
something is wrong, such as when you're talking to an impostor.
Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.

*Sense Enchantment:* You can tell that someone's behavior is being
influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting
effect),even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but
if the target is dominated (see *dominate person*), the DC is only 15
because of the limited range of the target's activities.

*Discern Secret Message:* You may use Sense Motive to detect that a
hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case,
your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character
transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the
message that you are missing, you take a --2 penalty on your Sense
Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something
hidden is being communicated, but you can't learn anything specific
about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and
understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any
hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false
information.

### Action
Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes
at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a
sense of the people around you.

### Try Again
No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each
Bluff check made against you.

### Special
A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks when using
this skill against a favored enemy.

If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sense Motive
checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2
bonus on Diplomacy checks.

## Sleight of Hand [(Dex; Trained Only; Armor Check Penalty)]

### Check
A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized,
unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as
making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is
determined to note where the item went.

When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is
opposed by the observer's Spot check. The observer's success doesn't
prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.

You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily
concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on
your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of
anyone observing you or the Search check of anyone frisking you. In the
latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search check, since
it's generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger
is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on
your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small
object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your
Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such
as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.

Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn't provoke an
attack of opportunity.

If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC
20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a Spot check
to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result
you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds
on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the
item.

You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you
were using the Perform skill. In such a case, your "act" encompasses
elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.

  -------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  Sleight of Hand DC   Task
  10                   Palm a coin-sized object, make a coin disappear
  20                   Lift a small object from a person
  -------------------- -------------------------------------------------

### Action
Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a standard action.
However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a free action by
taking a --20 penalty on the check.

### Try Again
Yes, but after an initial failure, a second Sleight of
Hand attempt against the same target (or while you are being watched by
the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC
for the task by 10.

### Special
If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on
Sleight of Hand checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on
Sleight of Hand checks.

### Untrained
An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply a Dexterity
check. Without actual training, you can't succeed on any Sleight of Hand
check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your
body.

  -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------- -----------

### Action
Not applicable.

### Try Again
Not applicable. There are no Speak Language checks to
fail.

The Speak Language skill doesn't work like other skills. Languages work
as follows.

-   You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your
    race), plus an additional number of languages equal to your starting
    Intelligence bonus.
-   You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but
    instead of buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you
    can speak.
-   You don't make Speak Language checks. You either know a language or
    you don't.
-   A literate character (anyone but a barbarian who has not spent skill
    points to become literate) can read and write any language she
    speaks. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several
    spoken languages share a single alphabet.

## Spellcraft (Int; Trained Only)

Use this skill to identify spells as they are cast or spells already in
place.

  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Spellcraft DC      Task
  13                 When using *read magic,* identify a *glyph of warding.* No action required.
  15 + spell level   Identify a spell being cast. (You must see or hear the spell's verbal or somatic components.) No action required. No retry.
  15 + spell level   Learn a spell from a spellbook or scroll (wizard only). No retry for that spell until you gain at least 1 rank in Spellcraft (even if you find another source to try to learn the spell from). Requires 8 hours.

  15 + spell level   When casting *detect magic,* determine the school of magic involved in the aura of a single item or creature you can see. (If the aura is not a spell effect, the DC is 15 + one-half caster level.) No action required.
  19                 When using *read magic,* identify a *symbol.* No action required.
  20 + spell level   Identify a spell that's already in place and in effect. You must be able to see or detect the effects of the spell. No action required. No retry.

  25 + spell level   After rolling a saving throw against a spell targeted on you, determine what that spell was. No action required. No retry.
  25                 Identify a potion. Requires 1 minute. No retry.
  20                 Draw a diagram to allow *dimensional anchor* to be cast on a *magic circle* spell. Requires 10 minutes. No retry. This check is made secretly so you do not know the result.
  30 or higher       Understand a strange or unique magical effect, such as the effects of a magic stream. Time required varies. No retry.
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Check
You can identify spells and magic effects. The DCs for
Spellcraft checks relating to various tasks are summarized on the table
above.

### Action
Varies, as noted above.

### Try Again
See above.

### Special
If you are a specialist wizard, you get a +2 bonus on
Spellcraft checks when dealing with a spell or effect from your
specialty school. You take a --5 penalty when dealing with a spell or
effect from a prohibited school (and some tasks, such as learning a
prohibited spell, are just impossible).

If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft
checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get
a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus on
Spellcraft checks to decipher spells on scrolls.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use
Magic Device checks related to scrolls.

Additionally, certain spells allow you to gain information about magic,
provided that you make a successful Spellcraft check as detailed in the
spell description.

## Spot [(Wis)]

### Check
The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or
creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the
Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature
isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a
successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.

A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an
invisible creature near you, though you can't actually see it.

Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Disguise
skill), and to read lips when you can't hear or understand what someone
is saying.

Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an
encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the
distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional
penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is distracted
(not concentrating on being observant).

  ------------------------- ---------
  Condition                 Penalty
  Per 10 feet of distance   --1
  Spotter distracted        --5
  ------------------------- ---------

*Read Lips:* To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you
must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak,
and understand the speaker's language. (This use of the skill is
language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex
speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line of sight to
the lips being read.

If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a
minute's worth of speaking, but you usually still miss certain details.
If the check fails by 4 or less, you can't read the speaker's lips. If
the check fails by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about
the speech. The check is rolled secretly in this case, so that you don't
know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.

### Action
Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot something in a
reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using an action.
Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a move action.
To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a
Spot check, and you can't perform any other action (other than moving at
up to half speed) during this minute.

### Try Again
Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see
previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per minute.

### Special
A fascinated creature takes a --4 penalty on Spot checks
made as reactions.

If you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spot checks.

A ranger gains a bonus on Spot checks when using this skill against a
favored enemy.

An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Spot checks.

The master of a hawk familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in
daylight or other lighted areas.

The master of an owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadowy
or other darkened areas.

## Survival [(Wis)]

### Check
You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild.
The table below gives the DCs for various tasks that require Survival
checks.

Survival does not allow you to follow difficult tracks unless you are a
ranger or have the Track feat (see the Restriction section below).

  ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Survival DC   Task
  10            Get along in the wild. Move up to one-half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 10.
  15            Gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving up to one-half your overland speed, or gain a +4 bonus if you remain stationary. You may grant the same bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15.
  15            Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand.
  15            Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance.
  Varies        Follow tracks (see the Track feat).
  ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Action
Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over
the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks
is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.

### Try Again
Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the
Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a Survival check
once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next
check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make
a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid
getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural
hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check
after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of searching.

### Restriction
While anyone can use Survival to find tracks
(regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the task is
10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat) can use
Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.

### Special
If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you can
automatically determine where true north lies in relation to yourself.

A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this skill to find
or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.

If you have the Self-Sufficient feat, you get a +2 bonus on Survival
checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus
on Knowledge (nature) checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2
bonus on Survival checks made while underground.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on
Survival checks in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert,
forest, hill, marsh, mountains, and plains).

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus
on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural
hazards.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2
bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival
checks to find or follow tracks.

## Swim [(Str; Armor Check Penalty)]

### Check
Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water.
Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round
action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by
4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or
more, you go underwater.

If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because
you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath.
You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your
Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move
actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round
action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for
which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a
character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as
normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution
check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC
for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you
begin to drown.

The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table
below.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------
  Water                                                                                                               Swim DC
  Calm water                                                                                                          10
  Rough water                                                                                                         15
  Stormy water                                                                                                        20^1^
  1 You can't take 10 on a Swim check in stormy water, even if you aren't otherwise being threatened or distracted.   
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------

Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6
points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.

### Action
A successful Swim check allows you to swim one-quarter of
your speed as a move action or one-half your speed as a full-round
action.

### Special
Swim checks are subject to double the normal armor check
penalty and encumbrance penalty.

If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Swim checks.

If you have the Endurance feat, you get a +4 bonus on Swim checks made
to avoid taking nonlethal damage from fatigue.

A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated
speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim
check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature always
can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered
when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming,
provided that it swims in a straight line.

## Tumble [(Dex; Trained Only; Armor Check Penalty)]

You can't use this skill if your speed has been reduced by armor, excess
equipment, or loot.

### Check
You can land softly when you fall or tumble past opponents.
You can also tumble to entertain an audience (as though using the
Perform skill). The DCs for various tasks involving the Tumble skill are
given on the table below.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Tumble DC                         | Task                              |

|                                   | normally. Check separately for    |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Obstructed or otherwise treacherous surfaces, such as natural cavern
floors or undergrowth, are tough to tumble through. The DC for any
Tumble check made to tumble into such a square is modified as indicated
below.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------
  Surface Is . . .                                                              DC Modifier

  Severely obstructed (natural cavern floor, dense rubble, dense undergrowth)   +5
  Lightly slippery (wet floor)                                                  +2

  1 Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.                                       
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------

*Accelerated Tumbling:* You try to tumble past or through enemies more
quickly than normal. By accepting a --10 penalty on your Tumble checks,
you can move at your full speed instead of one-half your speed.

### Action
Not applicable. Tumbling is part of movement, so a Tumble
check is part of a move action.

### Try Again
Usually no. An audience, once it has judged a tumbler as
an uninteresting performer, is not receptive to repeat performances.

You can try to reduce damage from a fall as an instant reaction only
once per fall.

### Special
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +3 dodge
bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2 dodge
bonus to AC.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +6 dodge bonus to AC
when executing the total defense standard action instead of the usual +4
dodge bonus to AC.

If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus
on Balance and Jump checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble
checks.

## Use Magic Device [(Cha; Trained Only)]

Use this skill to activate magic

### Check
You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic
item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell
ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different
race, or as if you were of a different alignment.

You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such
as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some
other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use
Magic Device check once per hour.

You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you
must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic
Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use
Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.

  -------------------------- ---------------------
  Task                       Use Magic Device DC
  Activate blindly           25
  Decipher a written spell   25 + spell level
  Use a scroll               20 + caster level
  Use a wand                 20
  Emulate a class feature    20
  Emulate an ability score   See text
  Emulate a race             25
  Emulate an alignment       30
  -------------------------- ---------------------

*Activate Blindly:* Some magic items are activated by special words,
thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using
the activation word, thought, or action, even when you're not and even
if you don't know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in
order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around,
or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus
on your Use Magic Device check if you've activated the item in question
at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can't activate the
device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means
that magical energy gets released but it doesn't do what you wanted it
to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or
that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of
damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap
that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could
not otherwise cast yourself.

*Decipher a Written Spell:* This usage works just like deciphering a
written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points
higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.

*Emulate an Ability Score:* To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a
high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells,
Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your
effective ability score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when
you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device
check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the
appropriate ability, you don't need to make this check.

*Emulate an Alignment:* Some magic items have positive or negative
effects based on the user's alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use
these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can
emulate only one alignment at a time.

*Emulate a Class Feature:* Sometimes you need to use a class feature to
activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the
emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This
skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class.
It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the
class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you
must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment
with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).

*Emulate a Race:* Some magic items work only for members of certain
races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an
item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race
at a time.

*Use a Scroll:* If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to
decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must
have the scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device
allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your
class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell
you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell
from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the
appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score in that
ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic
Device check (see above).

This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic
items.

*Use a Wand:* Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand's spell on
your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as
if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the
skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs.

### Action
None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the
action (if any) required to activate the magic item.

### Try Again
Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to
activate an item and you fail, then you can't try to activate that item
again for 24 hours.

### Special
You cannot take 10 with this skill.

You can't aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the
item may attempt such a check.

If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic
Device checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2
bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on
Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to
Spellcraft checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.

## Use Rope [(Dex)]

### Check
Most tasks with a rope are relatively simple. The DCs for
various tasks utilizing this skill are summarized on the table below.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Use Rope DC                                                          Task
  10                                                                   Tie a firm knot
  10^1^                                                                Secure a grappling hook
  15                                                                   Tie a special knot, such as one that slips, slides slowly, or loosens with a tug
  15                                                                   Tie a rope around yourself one-handed
  15                                                                   Splice two ropes together
  Varies                                                               Bind a character
  1 Add 2 to the DC for every 10 feet the hook is thrown; see below.   
  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Secure a Grappling Hook:* Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope
check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is
thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less
indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try
again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially
holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check
is made secretly, so that you don't know whether the rope will hold your
weight.

*Bind a Character:* When you bind another character with a rope, any
Escape Artist check that the bound character makes is opposed by your
Use Rope check.

You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone
than to escape from bonds. You don't even make your Use Rope check until
someone tries to escape.

### Action
Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that
provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a special knot,
or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action that
provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5
minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.

### Special
A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope
checks. If you cast an *animate rope* spell on a rope, you get a +2
circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using that rope.

These bonuses stack.

If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus
on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall
combination.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape
Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on
checks made to bind someone.
