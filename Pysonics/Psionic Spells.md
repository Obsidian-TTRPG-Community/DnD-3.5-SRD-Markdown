### Spell Descriptions

The following spell descriptions are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Brain Spider

-   Divination \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Cleric 8, Mind 7
-   **Components:** V, S, M, DF
-   **Casting Time:** 1 round
-   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
-   **Targets:** Up to eight living creatures
-   **Duration:** 1 min./level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell allows you to eavesdrop as a standard action on the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once, hearing as desired:

-   Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire.
-   Information from all minds about one particular topic, thing, or being, one nugget of information per caster level.
-   A study of the thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail.

Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature's mind, you can attempt (as a standard action) to implant a *suggestion* in the mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make another Will saving throw to resist the *suggestion,* using the save DC of the *brain spider* spell. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by the *suggestion.*) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the *brain spider* spell for that creature.

You can affect all intelligent beings of your choice within range (up to the limit of eight), beginning with known or named beings. Language is not a barrier, and you need not personally know the beings The spell cannot reach those who make a successful Will save.

*Material Component:* A spider of any size or kind. It can be dead, but must still have all eight legs.

#### Dweomer of Transference

-   Evocation
-   **Level:** Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 minute
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Target:** One willing psionic creature
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

With this spell, you form a radiating corona around the head of a psionic ally, then convert some of your spells into psionic power points. When you finish casting *dweomer of transference,* a red-orange glow surrounds the psionic creature's head. For the duration of the spell, any spells cast at the subject don't have their usual effect, instead converting themselves harmlessly into psionic energy that the subject can use as energy for psionic powers. You can cast any spell you like at the subject, even area spells, effect spells, and spells for whom the subject would ordinarily not be a legitimate target. The spells don't do anything other than provide the subject with power points, but you must still cast them normally, obeying the component and range requirements listed in the description of each spell.

For each spell you cast into the *dweomer of transference,* the psionic creature gets temporary power points, according to the following table. The transference isn't perfectly efficient. The temporary power points acquired through a *dweomer of transference* dissipate after 1 hour if they haven't already been spent.

| 3rd         | 4                     |
| 4th         | 6                     |
| 5th         | 8                     |
