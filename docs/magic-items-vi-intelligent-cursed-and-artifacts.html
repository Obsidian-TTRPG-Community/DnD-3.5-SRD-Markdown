      <h1>MAGIC ITEMS VI (INTELLIGENT, CURSED, &amp; <a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-3">ARTIFACTS</a>)</h1>

      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-7">INTELLIGENT ITEMS</a></h2>

      <p>
        Magic items sometimes have intelligence of their own. Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and
        feel the same way characters do and should be treated as NPCs. <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-7">Intelligent items</a> have extra abilities and
        sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items
        or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, <a href="magic-items-iv-scrolls-staffs-and-wands.html#section-1">scrolls</a>, and <a href="magic-items-iv-scrolls-staffs-and-wands.html#section-3">wands</a>, among other items, are
        never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-7">Intelligent items</a> can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
        scores. Treat them as constructs. <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-7">Intelligent items</a> often have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at
        will (as magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> do); many cannot see otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike most magic items, <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-7">intelligent items</a> can activate their own powers without waiting for a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> word from
        their owner. <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-7">Intelligent items</a> act during their owner’s turn in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> order.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-1"><a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-1-1">INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT</a></h3>

      <p>
        Any item with intelligence has an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. Note that intelligent <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> already have <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s, either
        stated or by implication.&nbsp; If you’re generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon’s <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> must
        fit with any <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>-oriented <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a> it has.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any character whose <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> does not <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-54">correspond</a> to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the
        table) gains one negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> never
        results in actual <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-21">level loss</a>, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way
        (including <i>restoration </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>). This negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is cumulative with any other penalties the item might
        already place on inappropriate wielders. Items with Ego scores (see below) of 20 to 29 bestow two negative
        levels. Items with Ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.

      <h4>Purpose</h4>

      <p>
        An item’s purpose must suit the type and <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> of the item and should always be treated reasonably. A
        purpose of “defeat/slay arcane spellcasters” doesn’t mean that the sword forces the wielder to kill every <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>
        she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>, <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a>, and <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> in
        the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>’s cabal to
        <a href="epic-spells.html#section-7-36">ruin</a>, as well as end the rule of a sorceress-<a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-9-6">queen</a> in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of “defend <a href="races.html#section-3">elves</a>”
        doesn’t mean that if the wielder is an <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-3">elf</a>, he only wants to help himself. It means that the item wants to be
        used in furthering the cause of <a href="races.html#section-3">elves</a>, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of
        “defeat/slay all” isn’t just a matter of self-preservation. It means that the item won’t rest (or let its
        wielder rest) until it places itself above all others.

      <p>
        A <a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-1-5">dedicated power</a> operates only when an intelligent item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This
        determination is always made by the item. It should always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends
        justify the means. Unlike its other powers, an intelligent item can refuse to use its <a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-1-5">dedicated power</a> even if
        the owner is dominant (see <a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-1-7">Items against Characters</a>, below).

      <p>
        Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. Only after all aspects of
        an item have been generated can its Ego score be calculated. An item’s Ego score helps determine whether the
        item or the character is dominant in their relationship, as detailed below.

      <h3 id="section-1-7"><a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-1-7">ITEMS AGAINST CHARACTERS</a></h3>

      <p>
        When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, absolutely true to its
        <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>’s goals or the item’s special
        purpose, personality conflict—item against character—results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or
        higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor
        does not always agree with the item.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (DC = item’s Ego). If the
        possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a
        critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so
        on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character’s desires and demands concessions such as any of
        the following.
      </p>

      <p>• Removal of associates or items whose <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> or personality is distasteful to the item.</p>

      <p>• The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</p>

      <p>• Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</p>

      <p>• Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</p>

      <p>• Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.</p>

      <p>• That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</p>

      <p>
        • That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> differences or
        conduct.
      </p>

      <p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following acts:</p>

      <p>• Force its possessor into combat.</p>

      <p>• Refuse to strike opponents.</p>

      <p>• Strike at its wielder or her associates.</p>

      <p>• Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</p>

      <p>• Cause itself to drop from the character’s grasp.</p>

      <p>
        Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character’s and item’s alignments or when
        their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> to have a lesser character
        possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> possessor so as to
        better accomplish its goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way,
        particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. No intelligent
        item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other
        intelligent item within 60 feet, and most <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-7">intelligent items</a> try their best to <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-41">mislead</a> or <a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-27">distract</a> their host so
        that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> might change this sort of behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even
        though they may never successfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force their demands but
        remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.

      <h2 id="section-2"><a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-8">CURSED ITEMS</a></h2>

      <p>
        <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-8">Cursed items</a> are magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact. Sometimes they’re directly bad for
        the user; sometimes they’re just inconvenient. Occasionally they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make
        difficult choices.

        <b>Delusion: </b>The user believes the item is what it appears to be, yet it actually has no magical power other
        than to deceive. The user is mentally fooled into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be convinced
        otherwise without the help of a <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-59">remove curse</a> </i>spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Opposite Effect or Target:</b> These <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-8">cursed items</a> malfunction, so that either they do the opposite of what
        the creator intended, or they target the user instead of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind
        here is that these items aren’t always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> that impose penalties
        on attack and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn’t necessarily immediately know what
        the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn’t immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once
        she knows, however, the item can be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the
        wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-59">remove curse</a> </i>spell is generally needed to get rid of the
        item.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Intermittent Functioning:</b> The three varieties of intermittent functioning items all function perfectly as
        described—at least some of the time. The three varieties are unreliable, dependent, and uncontrolled items.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Unreliable: </i>Each time the item is activated, there is a 5% chance (01–05 on d%) that it does not
        function.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Dependent: </i>The item only functions in certain situations. To determine what the situation is, either
        select a situation or roll on the following table.

        of 01–05 the item activates at some random point during that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Requirement:</b> In a sense, a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> word is a requirement. Nevertheless, some items have much more
        stringent requirements that must be met for them to be usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse
        functioning, one or more of the following <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> must be met.
      </p>

      <p>• Character must eat twice as much as normal.</p>

      <p>• Character must <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> twice as much as normal.</p>

      <p>• Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and then item functions normally thereafter).</p>

      <p>• Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp worth of valuables per day.</p>

      <p>• Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.</p>

      <p>• Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or his family.</p>

      <p>• Character must discard all other magic items.</p>

      <p>• Character must worship a particular deity.</p>

      <p>• Character must change her <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a> to a specific <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a>. (The item only works for characters of that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a>.)</p>

      <p>• Character must add a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class already.</p>

      <p>• Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.</p>

      <p>
        • Character must sacrifice some part of her life <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> (2 points of Constitution) one time. If the character
        gets the Constitution points back (such as from a <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-70">restoration </a> </i>spell), the item ceases functioning. (The
        item does not cease functioning if the character receives a Constitution increase caused by <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> gain, a
        <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a>, </i>or the use of a magic item.)
      </p>

      <p>• Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.</p>

      <p>• Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.</p>

      <p>• Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.</p>

      <p>• Item must be used at least once a day, or it won’t function again for its current possessor.</p>

      <p>
        • Item must draw blood when wielded (<a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> only). It can’t be put away or exchanged for another weapon until
        it has scored a hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-42">bless</a>, <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-28">atonement</a>, </i>or
        <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-15">animate objects</a></i>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never be determined randomly. An
        item with a requirement that is also intelligent often imposes its requirement through its personality. If the
        requirement is not met, the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day before
        the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time only, others monthly, and still
        others continuous).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Drawback:</b> Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor but they also carry some
        negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only when the item is used (or held, in the case of some
        items such as <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>), usually the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item.
      </p>

      <p>
        Roll on the table below to generate a drawback that (unless otherwise indicated) remains in effect as long as
        the item is in the character’s possession.

      <p>
        <a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-2-1">Specific Cursed Items</a> are provided as examples of <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-8">cursed items</a>. They are given creation <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a>, should
        someone want to intentionally create them (although that does not need to be the origin of the item). Note,
        however, two exceptions: The <i>crystal hypnosis ball </i>and the <i>bag of devouring </i>cannot be created by
        any known means.
      </p>

      <p>
        A simple <i>detect magic </i>spell yields a misleading aura and strength, often indicating that the item is a
        noncursed item of similar sort. An <i>identify </i>spell only has a 1% chance per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> to reveal a
        cursed item’s true properties, including the cursed aspect. <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-9">Analyze dweomer</a> </i>reveals the true nature of a
        cursed item.

        <b>Bag of Devouring: </b>This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem
        as if it were a <i>bag of holding</i>. The sack is, however, a lure used by an extradimensional creature—in
        fact, one of its feeding orifices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to “swallowing’’ if thrust within the bag. The
        <i>bag of devouring </i>is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but any time thereafter that it senses
        living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close
        around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> checks
        made to pull someone in.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a <i>bag of holding type I, </i>but each hour it has
        a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some
        other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim’s body and prevents any
        form of raising or <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-73">resurrection</a> that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a
        <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a>, <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-37">miracle</a>, </i>or <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-22">true resurrection</a> </i>spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for
        each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.

      <p>
        If a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> is spoken, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from
        1d4+5 feet off the ground (no <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the
        victim, swatting the face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end.
      </p>

      <p>
        The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a
        total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>. The straw end causes a victim
        to be blinded for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> when it hits. The broom has AC 13,
        18 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, and hardness 4.

        <b>Cloak of Poisonousness:</b> This cloak is usually made of a woolen material, although it can be made of

        garment can be handled without <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a>, but as soon as it is actually donned the wearer is killed instantly unless
        she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once donned, a <i>cloak of poisonousness </i>can be removed only with a <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-59">remove curse </a> </i>spell; doing this
        destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a <i><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-47">neutralize poison </a><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24"> </a> </i>spell is then used, it is possible to

        <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-70">suggestion</a> </i>is implanted in his mind (Will DC 19 negates).

        the <i>crystal hypnosis ball </i>gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a

        <b>Helm of Opposite <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">Alignment</a>:</b> This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. When placed upon the head,
        however, its curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> of the wearer
        is radically altered to an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> as different as possible from the former <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>—good to evil, chaotic to
        lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> is mental as well as
        moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on
        his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and
        later puts it on again, another save is required. The curse only works once; that is, a character whose
        <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time.
      </p>

        any attempt to return to the former <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any
        way possible.) If a character of a class with an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> requirement is affected, an <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-28">atonement</a> </i>spell is
        needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a <i>helm of opposite <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> </i>has functioned once,

        <b>Periapt of Foul Rotting:</b> This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the

        drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be
        removed only by application of a <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-59">remove curse</a> </i>spell followed by a <i>cure <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a> </i>and then a

The rotting can also be countered by crushing a

        <b>Scarab of Death: </b>This small pin appears to be any one of the various beneficial amulets, brooches, or
        scarabs. However, if it is held for more than 1 round or carried by a living creature for 1 minute, it changes
        into a horrible burrowing beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh,
        and reaches the victim’s heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the
        scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but he still takes 3d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. The beetle then returns to
        its scarab form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents the monster
        from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item.

        within its pages. However, any character not already able to use <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> gains one negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> for as long as
        the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A <i>book of infinite <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> </i>contains 1d8+22
        pages. The nature of each page is determined by a <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a> roll: 01–50, arcane spell; 51–100, divine spell.

      <p>Determine the exact spell by using the tables for determining major scroll <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back—paging through a <i>book of infinite spells </i>is a one-way
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a>. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the
        last page is turned, the book vanishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be
        one that is on the character’s class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be
        ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> cannot be cast as scroll <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, nor can they be
        copied into a spellbook—their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in
        a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> by means of its power.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> connected with its use causes the page to magically
        turn despite all precautions. The owner knows this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a
        new spell. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the
        owner is.

        <b>Deck of Many Things: </b>A <i>deck of many things </i>(both beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box
        or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with
        glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon
        the person who drew it, for better or worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        The character with a <i>deck of many things </i>who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will
        draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw
        from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted
        number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own.
        <i>Exception: </i>If the jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless
        the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A
        <i>deck of many things </i>contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as
        indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary
        playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are
        fully described below.

        <i>Fates: </i>This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the
        fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop
        something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card;

        <i>wishes </i>(full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These <i>wishes </i>are the same as
        those granted by the 9th-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number

      <p>
        hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious

        effect.

        <i>Skull: </i>A <a href="monsters-t-z.html#section-18-3">dread wraith</a><a href="monsters-t-z.html#section-18"></a> appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. The character must fight it
        alone—if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever
        and cannot be revived, even with a <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> </i>or a <i><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-37">miracle</a></i>.

        <i>Throne: </i>The character becomes a true leader in people’s eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area
        she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Vizier: </i>This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of
        wisdom to solve any

        single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within one year.

        <i>The Void: </i>This black card <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> instant disaster. The character’s body continues to function, as though
        comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere—in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the
        possession of an outsider. A <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> </i>or a <i><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-37">miracle</a> </i>does not bring the character back, instead merely

      <p>
        <b>Philosopher’s Stone:</b> This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the
        stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone’s heart. This cavity is lined with a
        magical type of quicksilver that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into
        silver and gold. A single <i>philosopher’s stone </i>can turn from up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver, or up
        to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses
        its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.
      </p>

      <p>

        <b>Sphere of Annihilation:</b> A <i>sphere of annihilation </i>is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of
        nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter
        that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the
        direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <i>sphere of annihilation </i>is static, resting in some <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a> as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to
        move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-1">telekinesis</a>, too weak to move actual objects
        but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character’s ability to gain control of a
        <i>sphere of annihilation </i>(or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC
        30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds,
        the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too
        closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30)
        each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can
        control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The sphere’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> in a round is 10
        feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character’s control check result in that round exceeded 30.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it.
      </p>

      <p>
        If two or more creatures vie for control of a <i>sphere of annihilation, </i>the rolls are opposed. If none are
        successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Should a <i><a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-35">gate</a> </i>spell be cast upon a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, there is a 50% chance (01–50 on d%)
        that the spell destroys it, a 35% chance (51–85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15% chance (86–100) that a
        gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. If a
        <i>rod of cancellation </i>touches a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>,
      </p>

      <p>
        they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius takes 2d6x10 points of

      <p>
        A <i>staff of the magi </i>gives the wielder <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the
        staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> directed at its wielder, as a
        <i>rod of absorption</i> does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than
        retaining them as spell <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its
        limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no
        idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge </a> as a
        <i>rod of absorption </i>does. (Thus, absorbing <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can be risky.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Retributive Strike: </i>A <i>staff of the magi </i>can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must
        be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within
        10 feet of the broken staff take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those
        between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30
        feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> by half.
      </p>

      <p>
        The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but
        if she does not (51–100), the explosive release of spell <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> destroys her. Only specific items, including the
        <i>staff of the magi </i>and the <i>staff of power</i> are capable of a retributive strike.

        <b>Talisman of Pure Good:</b> A good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming
        crack to open at the feet of an evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended
        victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be

      <p>

        of cancellation have no effect upon a <i>sphere of annihilation, </i>the talisman’s power of control can be

        <b>Talisman of Reluctant Wishes: </b>A talisman of this sort appears the same as a
        <i>stone of controlling earth elementals. </i>Its powers are quite different, however, and dependent on the
        Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a
        <i>talisman of reluctant wishes, </i>he must make a DC 15 Charisma check.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he fails, the device acts as a <i>stone of weight</i>. Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish </a> </i>is made with it,
        whichever comes first. It then disappears.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he
        has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> </i>for every 6 points of the
        character’s Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical
        or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of which reaction results, a <i>talisman of reluctant wishes </i>disappears when its time period

        <b>The Moaning Diamond:</b> The <i>Moaning Diamond </i>appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a human fist.
        At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the
        <i>Moaning Diamond </i>is not evil. The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape
        earth and stone as if by the spell <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-65">stone shape</a>, </i>affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. The
        <i>Moaning Diamond </i>can summon an elder <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2-3">earth elemental</a><a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2"></a> with maximum <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> that serves the caster until

      <p>
        <b>The Orbs of Dragonkind:</b> Each of these fabled orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient
        dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and <a href="monsters-dr-dw.html#section-3">metallic dragons</a>). The
        bearer of an <i>Orb </i>can <i>dominate </i>dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as
        <i>dominate monster</i>), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (<a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> is not
        useful against this effect.) Each <i>Orb of Dragonkind </i>bestows upon the wielder the AC and <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>
        bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether
        they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the
        <i>Orb. </i>A character possessing an <i>Orb of Dragonkind </i>is immune to the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a>—but only the
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a>—of the dragon variety keyed to the <i>Orb. </i>Finally, a character possessing an <i>Orb </i>can
        herself use the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a> of the dragon in the <i>Orb </i>three times per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        All <i>Orbs of Dragonkind </i>can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other
        <i>Orbs. </i>The owner of an <i>Orb </i>knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For
        dragons of the <i>Orb</i>’s particular variety, the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the
        <i>Orb</i>’s variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-2-1">age</a> of the creature. The bearer of one of
        these <i>Orbs </i>earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their
        kin, even if she later loses the item.
      </p>

      <p>Each <i>Orb </i>also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at 10th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>.</p>

        (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>, the wielder takes a –2 penalty on all attack
        rolls, saves, and checks.

      <p>The <i>Shadowstaff </i>also has these powers.</p>

      <p>
        • <i>Summon Shadows: </i>Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the
        wielder as if called by a <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-77">summon monster V</a> </i>spell cast at 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.

        wielder as if called by a <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-81">summon monster IX</a> </i>spell cast at 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.

        • <i><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">Shadow</a> Form: </i>Three times per day the wielder can become a living <a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">shadow</a>, with all the <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> powers
        granted by the

        • <i><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">Shadow</a> Bolt: </i>Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to a single target. The <a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">shadow</a> <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-24">bolt</a> has a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of 100 feet.

        The <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">Shield</a> of the Sun: This <i>+5 large shield, </i>emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to
        cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> as if she were a 20th-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-1">paladin</a> with a Wisdom score of 20. The <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> gained are cumulative with
        any existing <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> per day that the character might have, even if she’s already a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-1">paladin</a>. The
        <i>Shield of the Sun </i>also grants <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 10 points of
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from any <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year
        the <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a>’s owner must undertake a quest (no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity.

      <p>
        A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four negative levels if she attempts to use this
        artifact. Although these negative levels never results in actual <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-21">level loss</a>, they remain as long as the <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a>
        is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>). The negative levels
        disappear when the <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> is stowed or leaves the wearer’s possession.
