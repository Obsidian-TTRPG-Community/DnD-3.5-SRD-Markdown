      <h1><a href="special-materials.html">SPECIAL MATERIALS</a></h1>

      <p>In addition to magic items created with <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, some substances have innate special properties.</p>

      <p>
        If you make a suit of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the
        most prevalent material. However, you can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special
        material.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-1"><a href="special-materials.html#section-0-1">SPECIAL WEAPONS MATERIALS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Each of the <a href="special-materials.html">special materials</a> described below has a definite game effect. Some creatures have <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>
        based on their creature type or core concept. Some are resistant to all but a special type of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, such as
        that dealt by evil-aligned <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> or bludgeoning <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. Others are vulnerable to <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> of a particular
        material. Characters may choose to carry several different types of <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, depending upon the campaign and
        types of creatures they most commonly encounter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Adamantine:</b> This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. <a href="equipment.html#section-2">Weapons </a> fashioned from
        adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> or attacking objects, ignoring
        hardness less than 20. <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a> made from adamantine grants its wearer <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> of 1/– if it’s <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>,
        2/– if it’s medium <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, and 3/– if it’s heavy <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. Adamantine is so costly that <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> made from
        it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine
        <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and the <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> check penalty of adamantine
        <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from
        adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine. <a href="equipment.html#section-2">Weapons</a>, <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> and
        shields normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> than normal.
        Adamantine has 40 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and hardness 20.

      <p>
        <b>Darkwood:</b> This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>. Any wooden or mostly wooden item
        (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from darkwood is considered a masterwork item and weighs only half as
        much as a normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a
        battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of
        darkwood. The <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> check penalty of a darkwood <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> of its
        type. To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of
        a masterwork version of that item.
      </p>

      <p>Darkwood has 10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and hardness 5.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Dragonhide:</b> <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a>smiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> or <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a>s of masterwork
        quality. One dragon produces enough <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> for a single suit of masterwork <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> for a creature one size
        category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a>, an armorsmith can produce
        one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a
        creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes
        smaller. In each case, enough <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> is available to produce a small or large masterwork <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> in addition to the
        <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, provided that the dragon is Large or larger.
      </p>

      <p>Because <a href="monsters-dr-dw.html#section-1-2">dragonhide</a> <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> isn’t made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="monsters-dr-dw.html#section-1-2">Dragonhide</a> <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> costs double what <a href="equipment.html#section-3-3">masterwork armor</a> of that type ordinarily costs, but it takes no longer to
        make than ordinary <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> of that type.
      </p>

      <p><a href="monsters-dr-dw.html#section-1-2">Dragonhide</a> has 10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Iron, Cold:</b> This iron, mined deep underground, known for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is
        forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. <a href="equipment.html#section-2">Weapons</a> made of cold iron cost twice as much
        to make as their normal counterparts. Also, any magical enhancements cost an additional 2,000 gp.
      </p>

      <p>
        Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff
        could not.
      </p>

      <p>A double weapon that has only half of it made of cold iron increases its cost by 50%.</p>

      <p>Cold iron has 30 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Mithral:</b> Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard.
        When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> and is occasionally used for
        other items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> and other
        limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, but <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> armors are
        still treated as <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>. <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-5">Spell failure</a> chances for <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>s and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%,
        maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).
      </p>

      <p>
        An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>,
        this <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>er weight does not change a weapon’s size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether
        it is <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being
        partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a scythe cannot be.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="equipment.html#section-2">Weapons</a> or armors fashioned from mithral are always <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-12">masterwork items</a> as well; the masterwork cost is included in
        the prices given below.
      </p>

      <p>Mithral has 30 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and hardness 15.</p>

        <b>Silver, Alchemical:</b> A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made
        of steel so that it bypasses the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> of creatures such as lycanthropes.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a successful attack with a silvered weapon, the wielder takes a –1 penalty on the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> roll (with the usual
        minimum of 1 point of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>). The alchemical silvering process can’t be applied to nonmetal items, and it
        doesn’t work on rare metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.
      </p>

      <p>Alchemical silver has 10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and hardness 8.</p>
