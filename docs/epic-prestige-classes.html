        These are classes that characters cannot pursue until they have already become epic characters in some other

        character class at epic levels. As with other epic classes, a character can take as many levels in an epic
        prestige class as he or she desires.

      <p><b>Class Features</b></p>

      <p>The following are class features of the agent retriever prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> An agent retriever gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or
        shields.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</b> At each agent retriever level, the character gains new spells per day (and
        spells known, if applicable) as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he or she
        belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only the
        benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a
        character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming
        an agent retriever, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining
        spells per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Uncanny Location </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> When a agent retriever spends one day attuning him or herself to a
        person or object he or she is seeking, he or she automatically determines that person’s or item’s location as
        the <i>discern location </i>spell. Once he or she has established a sense of the location, the agent retriever
        can maintain this uncanny link even if the target moves, but only so long as he or she hunts down this person or
        item to the exclusion of all other pursuits. If he or she ever turns aside to undertake a second pursuit, the
        <i>uncanny location </i>ends, and the agent retriever must spend another day to reattune him or herself to the
        target.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Tracking Bonus (Ex):</b> The agent retriever gains a +10 insight bonus on Wilderness Lore checks to track the
        quarry. This bonus increases by +10 every five levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Plane Shift </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> The agent retriever can use <i>plane shift </i>as a 14th-level caster
        once per day starting at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Force Sphere </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> The agent retriever gains the ability to call forth a
        <i>force sphere. </i>The agent retriever can attempt to enclose any creature or object he or she can see within
        30 feet. The target is allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + 1/2 the class level of the agent retriever + the
        agent retriever’s Dexterity modifier). Those who fail are then encapsulated in a sphere of force with a radius
        of up to 50 feet (the sphere is only as large as it needs to be, up to its maximum radius). Those trapped inside
        cannot escape except with methods that can bypass or destroy a <i>wall of forc</i>e. The sphere persists as long
        as the agent retriever desires, up to a maximum of seven days. A captured target does not count toward the
        capacity of the agent retriever’s <i>plane shift </i>ability, and the agent retriever can plane shift with the
        target despite the presence of the <i>force sphere. </i>The agent retriever can use this power once per day at
        3rd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Ethereal Jaunt </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> The agent retriever can use <i>ethereal jaunt </i>as a 14th-level
        caster once per day at 4th level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feats:</b> The agent retriever gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every five
        levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Epic Endurance, Epic Prowess,
        Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Fast Healing, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Spell Capacity,
        Legendary Climber, Legendary Rider, Legendary Tracker, Perfect Health, Permanent Emanation, Spontaneous Spell,
        Storm of Throws, Swarm of Arrows, and Uncanny Accuracy.
      </p>

      <p><b>Class Features</b></p>

      <p>The following are class features of the cosmic descryer prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A cosmic descryer gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</b> At every other cosmic descryer level, the character gains new spells per day
        (and spells known, if applicable) as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he or
        she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only
        the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other
        benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class
        before becoming a cosmic descryer, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of
        determining spells per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Superior Planar Summoning (Ex):</b> Beginning at 1st level, the cosmic descryer can increase the power of any
        of the following spells—<i
          >elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, summon monster IX, </i
        >or <i>summon nature’s ally I</i>X—to affect or summon outsiders of 4 Hit Dice higher than the spell’s normal
        limit or conjure creatures with 4 Hit Dice of advancement. Every four levels thereafter, the cosmic descryer can
        increase the number of extra Hit Dice by 4.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Naturalization (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, the cosmic descryer develops a natural affinity for one plane
        that he or she has visited, becoming resistant to any spells and spell-like effects that would normally affect
        any creature not native to that plane. Every two levels thereafter, the cosmic descryer gains naturalization to
        one additional plane.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Enduring Gate (Su):</b> Starting at 3rd level, as a full-round action, the cosmic descryer can make any
        casting of the <i>gate </i>spell remain for a full day, rather than disappearing after 1 round per caster level.
        Every three levels thereafter, the cosmic descryer can increase the duration of <i>gate </i>by one additional
        day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feat (Ex):</b> The cosmic descryer gains a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every
        five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Augmented Alchemy, Automatic
        Quicken Spell, Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Combat Casting, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
        Craft Epic Rod, Craft Epic Staff, Craft Epic Wondrous Item, Efficient Item Creation, Enhance Spell, Epic Spell
        Focus, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spellcasting, Familiar Spell, Forge Epic Ring, Ignore Material Components,
        Improved Combat Casting, Improved Heighten Spell, Improved Metamagic, Improved Spell Capacity, Intensify Spell,
        Multispell, Permanent Emanation, Scribe Epic Scroll, Spell Focus, Spell Knowledge, Spell Mastery, Spell
        Opportunity, Spell Penetration, Spell Stowaway, Spontaneous Spell, Tenacious Magic.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Cosmic Connection (Su):</b> At 7th level, the cosmic descryer may join with the massive energy of the
        multiverse once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The cosmic descryer can
        remain connected for a number of minutes equal to his or her class level. While connected, the character is
        immune to critical hits, is a native on any plane he or she visits, and can use <i>dimension door </i>at will as
        a 20th-level caster. The cosmic descryer can draw off excess energy from the multiverse itself to increase his
        or her effective caster level or enhance any attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. Drawing
        off excess energy from the multiverse is dangerous, and it deals the cosmic descryer 5 points of damage for each
        +1 bonus applied to a single roll or +1 caster level on a single spell.
      </p>

      <h2>Class Features</h2>

      <p>All the following are features of the divine emissary prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</b> At each divine emissary level, the character gains new spells per day (and
        spells known, if applicable) as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he or she
        belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spell-caster, the character gains only the
        benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a
        character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming
        a divine emissary, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining
        spells per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special Mount:</b> If he or she has one, the divine emissary’s special mount continues to increase in power.
        Every five levels after 1st, the special mount gains +2 bonus Hit Dice, its natural armor increases by +2, its
        Strength adjustment increases by +1, and its Intelligence increases by +1. The mount’s spell resistance equals
        the divine emissary’s class level + the class level that provided the special mount + 5.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Granted Domain (Ex):</b> A divine emissary gains access to one of his or her deity’s domains, as well as the
        granted power of that domain. The extra domain expands a paladin’s selection of spells, but he or she does not
        gain the ability to cast higher-level spells than he or she otherwise could. Clerics gain an additional domain
        but otherwise use the rules for preparing spells from their domains normally.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Divine Inspiration </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> A divine emissary gains a +2 luck bonus on his or her attack and
        damage rolls for 10 rounds, once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day every three levels
        thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Extra Smite (Su):</b> A divine emissary can use his or her smite ability two extra times per day, plus one
        additional time per day every three levels thereafter. To determine the damage with any smite attack, a divine
        emissary adds together his or her divine emissary levels and class levels that originally conferred the smite
        ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Greater Planar Ally </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> The emissary can call a <i>greater planar ally </i>(as the spell)
        once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day every ten levels thereafter. The ally does not
        request a return favor when a divine emissary uses this ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feats:</b> The divine emissary gains a bonus feat at 6th level and an additional bonus feat every ten
        levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Armor Skin, Devastating Critical,
        Epic Leadership, Epic Prowess, Epic Reputation, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Great Smiting, Holy Strike,
        Improved Aura of Courage, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Spell Capacity, Legendary Commander, Legendary
        Rider, Overwhelming Critical, Perfect Health, Permanent Emanation, Planar Turning, Positive Energy Aura,
        Spectral Strike, Spontaneous Spell, Widen Aura of Courage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Divine Hand (Su):</b> As a free action, the emissary gains a +20 sacred (or profane if appropriate) bonus on
        his next melee or ranged attack roll, as long as the attack is made with the deity’s favored weapon. The
        emissary can use divine hand once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day every ten levels
        thereafter.
      </p>

      <h2>Class Features</h2>

      <p>The following are class features of the epic infiltrator prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> An epic infiltrator is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all
        armor, and shields.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Improved Cover Identity (Ex/Su):</b> At 1st level, an epic infiltrator establishes three specific cover
        identities, plus one additional cover identity every four levels thereafter. While operating in a cover
        identity, the epic infiltra-tor gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on
        Bluff and Gather Information checks. When the epic infiltrator has the option of adding a new cover identity, he
        or she may instead work on further perfecting a cover identity already possessed. An improved cover identity
        grants a +6 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information
        checks while operating in that identity. A specific cover identity may be improved multiple times, each time
        adding +2 to the bonuses. It is impossible to detect the epic infiltrator’s alignment with any form of
        divination. This ability functions exactly like an <i>undetectable alignment </i>spell, except that it is always
        active as a supernatural ability. Only divinations are confounded; spells that function only against certain
        alignments affect the epic infiltrator normally. Should the epic infiltrator wish to “retire” a cover identity
        and develop a new one, he or she must spend one week practicing the new identity before he or she earns the
        bonuses. Cover identities do not in themselves provide the epic infiltrator with additional skills,
        proficiencies, or class features that others might expect of the pretended professions. The epic infiltrator can
        switch cover identities or don a disguise using the Disguise skill in 1d3 minutes. He or she can also put on or
        take off armor in one-half the normal time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Sneak Attack:</b> If an epic infiltrator can catch an opponent when the opponent is unable to defend
        effectively from his or her attack, he or she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the epic
        infiltrator’s target would be denied his or her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he or she actually has a
        Dexterity bonus or not), the epic infiltrator’s attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases
        by +1d6 points every three levels. Should the epic infiltrator score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this
        extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or
        less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, the epic infiltrator can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage
        instead of normal damage. He or she cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a
        sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty. An epic infiltrator can only sneak attack living creatures
        with discernible anatomies—undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to
        attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the epic
        infiltrator must also be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a
        vital spot. The epic infiltrator cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by
        striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If an epic infiltrator gets a sneak attack bonus
        from another source, the bonuses to damage stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Specialist Training (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, the epic infiltrator gains the benefit of focusing his or her
        craft on a particular type of work, specializing in one of the following categories and receiving a +3 bonus on
        all checks with the listed skills. Every three levels thereafter, the epic infiltrator gains specialist training
        again. He or she may select the same category more than once.
      </p>

      <p><i>Concealment: </i>Bluff, Disguise, and Forgery.</p>

      <p><i>Subterfuge: </i>Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, and Pick Pocket.</p>

      <p><i>Espionage: </i>Listen, Search, and Spot.</p>

      <p><i>Interaction: </i>Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense Motive.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Read Thoughts (Su):</b> Beginning at 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can <i>detect thoughts </i>as the spell
        cast by a 15th-level caster, except that it targets a single mind. Every four levels thereafter, the epic
        infiltrator can per-form this ability one additional time per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Far Senses (Su):</b> Starting at 4th level, the epic infiltrator can extend his or her vision or hearing into
        an area beyond his or her normal range, once per day, to a distance of 20 feet plus an additional 20 feet per
        epic infiltrator level. The epic infiltrator must have personally visited the physical location earlier to use
        far senses on it. Barriers do not impede far senses, and low-light vision or darkvision function normally if the
        epic infiltrator has one or both of those abilities. Far senses can also apply to the epic infiltrator’s read
        thoughts ability. Every two levels beyond 4th the epic infiltrator can perform this ability one additional time
        per day. This ability functions as the <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance </i>spell cast by a 15th-level caster,
        except for the limit on range, the need to know the locale beforehand, and the ability to use the read thoughts
        ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Mind Blank </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> At 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can become immune to all mind-affecting
        spells and divinations once per day, plus one additional time per day every eight levels thereafter. This
        ability works as the <i>mind blank </i>spell cast by a 15th-level caster.
      </p>

      <p><b>Class Features</b></p>

      <p>The following are class features of the guardian paramount prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A guardian paramount is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all
        armor, and shields.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feats:</b> The guardian paramount gets a bonus feat at 1st level and an additional bonus feat every
        three levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Bulwark of Defense, Combat
        Archery, Damage Reduction, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Dodge, Epic Fortitude, Epic Reflexes, Epic
        Reputation, Epic Skill Focus, Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Epic Trapfinding, Epic Will, Exceptional Deflection,
        Fast Healing, Great Dexterity, Improved Combat Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Improved Spell Resistance,
        Infinite Deflection, Legendary Climber, Lingering Damage, Mobile Defense, Perfect Health, Reflect Arrows,
        Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity, Spellcasting Harrier, and Uncanny Accuracy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Uncanny Dodge Enabler (Ex):</b> The guardian paramount must have the uncanny dodge class feature to qualify
        for the prestige class, so at a minimum the guardian paramount has the extraordinary ability to retain his or
        her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. It
        is possible that the character has higher-level aspects of the uncanny dodge ability. Whatever the level of
        uncanny dodge attained by the character, the guardian paramount can extend the features of his or her uncanny
        dodge ability to include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her (he or she can
        designate a creature or change designations as a free action once per round). The guardian paramount can extend
        his or her uncanny dodge ability three times per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day every three
        levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Evasive Preceptor (Ex):</b> The guardian paramount must have the evasion class feature, which allows the
        character to take no damage from an area attack with a successful Reflex save. He or she may also have improved
        evasion, though this is not a prerequisite. The character can extend evasion or improved evasion to include any
        one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her. The guardian paramount can extend his or her
        evasion ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Protective Aura </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> Starting at 3rd level, the guardian paramount can use a special form
        of <i>shield other </i>once per day, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. When a
        guardian paramount creates a <i>protective aur</i>a, the transferred wounds are dealt to the guardian paramount
        as subdual damage, not normal damage, as with the <i>shield other </i>spell. Otherwise, the guardian paramount’s
        <i>protective aura </i>functions like the <i>shield other spell </i>cast by an 8th-level cleric.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Adjust Probability (Ex):</b> On reaching 5th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to affect
        probability twice per day, plus one additional time per day per three levels thereafter. The guardian paramount
        can force a reroll of one attack roll, check, or saving throw that another creature within 25 feet—friend or
        enemy—just made. The guardian paramount can find out whether the attack roll, check, or save would have
        succeeded before using this ability. The recipient must take the second roll, whether it’s better or worse than
        the original roll. The use of this ability takes place outside the normal initiative order, but the paramount
        guardian can’t use it if he or she is flat-footed or unable to see the situation resulting in the roll. The
        guardian paramount must decide whether to reroll as soon as the result of the attack roll, check, or save is
        known.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Call Back </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> On reaching 6th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to return a
        dead creature that he or she has previously used any of his or her other class abilities on back to life, as if
        he or she had cast <i>true resurrection </i>as a 20th-level cleric. The character can use this ability once per
        day, plus one additional time per day every six levels.
      </p>

      <h2>HIGH PROSELYTIZER</h2>

      <p><b>Hit Die:</b> d8.</p>

      <p><b>Class Features</b></p>

      <p>The following are class features of the high proselytizer prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> High proselytizers are proficient with all simple weapons, all armor, and
        all shields.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells per Day:</b> At every other high proselytizer level, the character gains new spells per day as if he
        or she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which he or she belonged before adding the
        prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the
        Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class
        would have gained. If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a high
        proselytizer, the player must decide to which class to add each high proselytizer level for the purpose of
        determining spells per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Proselytize </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> At 1st level, the high proselytizer gains the ability to preach the word
        of his or her deity to large crowds with great effect. He or she may speak in such a manner once per day, plus
        one additional time per day per ten class levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Proselytize </i>has three effects. First, any time the high proselytizer is speaking in this manner, he or
        she is treated as though affected by a <i>sanctuary </i>spell. Second, his or her voice can be heard clearly by
        anyone within a radius of 100 feet plus 50 feet per class level, regardless of background noise, and his or her
        speech can be understood as though the audience were affected by a <i>comprehend languages </i>spell. Finally,
        everyone in the range of the high proselytizer’s voice immediately has a chance of becoming enraptured:

      <p>
        Enraptured audience members act as though affected by a <i>symbol of persuasion</i>, changing alignment as
        appropriate and otherwise functioning according to the <i>charm person </i>spell. The high proselytizer can
        inspire the crowd to take any of a number of actions, depending on his or her alignment. Any suicidal suggestion
        grants audience members a new saving throw to break the rapture (with the exception of low-level followers of
        the same deity, who never got a save in the first place). This rapture lasts for 10 minutes plus an additional 5
        minutes per high proselytizer level.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 3rd level, the high proselytizer’s proselytize ability includes deific touch once per day, plus one
        additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. During his or her speech, the high proselytizer can move
        among the enraptured, shaking hands, caressing brows, and otherwise making contact with audience members. Anyone
        so touched is healed of 1d4 points of damage and cured of any natural disease or poison. Up to six individuals
        per round can be so affected. An audience member can only benefit from deific touch once per proselytize
        session. The high proselytizer can use deific touch as long as his or her proselytize ability lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 5th level, the <i>proselytize </i>ability includes <i>deific word </i>once per day, plus one additional time
        per day per ten levels thereafter. The words spoken by the high proselytizer can, if he or she chooses, function
        as a triple-strength <i>sound burst </i>spell (3d8 points of sonic damage and a Will save to avoid being stunned
        for 3 rounds) to all who are not enraptured, as the spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The
        <i>deific word </i>can occur at any point during his or her <i>proselytize </i>speech.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 7th level, the <i>proselytize </i>ability includes <i>deific face </i>once per day, plus one additional time
        per day per ten levels thereafter. When the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a blinding burst to
        shine from his or her face. <i>Deific face </i>functions against all in the audience who are not enraptured as
        the <i>sunburst </i>spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The <i>deific face </i>can occur at any point during his
        or her speech.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 9th level, the <i>proselytize </i>ability includes <i>deific aura </i>once per day, plus one additional time
        per day per ten levels thereafter. When the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a rolling wave of
        deific power to spring from his or her body that functions as either a <i>blasphemy, dictum, holy word, </i>or
        <i>word of chaos </i>spell (as appropriate for his or her alignment), affecting only those in the audience who
        have resisted becoming enraptured. <i>Deific aura </i>otherwise functions as the relevant spell cast by a
        20th-level cleric. The <i>deific aura </i>can occur at any point during his or her speech.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Heal </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> At 2nd level, the high proselytizer can use <i>heal </i>on his or herself or
        another creature once per day, plus one additional time per day per four levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feats:</b> The high proselytizer gets a bonus feat at 4th level and an additional bonus feat every four
        levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be chosen from the following list: Armor Skin, Automatic Quicken
        Spell, Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Bonus Domain, Enhance Spell, Epic Reputation, Epic Spell
        Focus, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spellcasting, Epic Will, Extended Life Span, Great Charisma, Great Wisdom,
        Ignore Material Components, Improved Alignment-Based Casting, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Heighten Spell,
        Improved Metamagic, Improved Spell Capacity, Intensify Spell, Legendary Commander, Multispell, Negative Energy
        Burst, Per-manent Emanation, Planar Turning, Polyglot, Positive Energy Aura, Spectral Strike, Spell Stowaway,
        Spell Opportunity, Spontaneous Domain Access, Spontaneous Spell, Tenacious Magic, Undead Mastery, Zone of
        Animation.

      <p><b>Class Features</b></p>

      <p>The following are class features of the legendary dreadnought prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A legendary dreadnought is proficient with all simple and martial weapons,
        all armor, and all shields.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Unstoppable (Ex):</b> At 1st level, the legendary dreadnought can concentrate his or her power, gaining a +20
        bonus on his or her Strength check to break or burst a door or item once per day, plus one additional time per
        day every five levels thereafter. As a special use of this ability, the legendary dreadnought can attempt to
        break a <i>wall of force </i>(Strength DC 32, and the character applies his or her unstoppable bonus to this
        check as well). Alternatively, the legendary dreadnought can apply the +20 bonus to a single attack roll.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Unmovable (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, the legendary dreadnought can concentrate his or her power, making him or
        herself unmovable once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.&nbsp; This power
        grants the character a +20 bonus on any one of the following:
      </p>

      <p>A grapple check made to avoid being grabbed with the improved grab ability.</p>

      <p>A Strength check to avoid the effects of a bull rush, trip attempt, or similar effect.</p>

      <p>A Strength check against any effect that would move the character either physically or magically.</p>

      <p>
        Any one saving throw. If an effect that would move the character either physically or magically does not
        normally allow a saving throw, the legendary dreadnought can use this ability to gain a Will saving throw. He or
        she still gains the +20 bonus on the saving throw in such a case.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shrug off Punishment (Ex):</b> The legendary dreadnought gains 12 bonus hit points at 3rd level and 12 more
        every five levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Thick Skinned (Ex):</b> At 4th level, the legendary dreadnought gains damage reduction 3/–. This does not
        stack with damage reduction granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects, but it does stack with any
        damage reduction granted by permanent magical effects, class features, the Damage Reduction feat, and this
        ability itself. The damage reduction improves by 3 points every five levels thereafter
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feats:</b> The legendary dreadnought gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every
        five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Armor Skin, Devastating
        Critical, Dire Charge, Epic Fortitude, Epic Prowess, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon
        Specialization, Fast Healing, Great Constitution, Great Strength, Improved Combat Reflexes, Overwhelming
        Critical, Penetrate Damage Reduction.
      </p>

      <p><b>Class Features</b></p>

      <p>The following are class features of the perfect wight prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A perfect wight gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Greater Invisibility (Su):</b> Starting at 1st level, the perfect wight gains the benefit of
        <i>greater invisibility </i>once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The
        <i>greater invisibility </i>is as the spell cast by a 20th-level caster.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Improved Legerdemain (Su):</b> A perfect wight can perform the following class skills at a range of 30 feet:
        Disable Device, Open Lock, Pick Pocket, and Search. If desired, the perfect wight can take 10 on the check. Any
        object manipulated during the skill check must weigh 100 pounds or less. Alternatively, the perfect wight can
        use improved legerdemain to make one melee sneak attack against any creature within 30 feet. The perfect wight
        executes the sneak attack (or death attack, if applicable) as if attacking from a flanking position. If the
        attack is successful, the victim is dealt the appropriate sneak attack damage despite the fact that the perfect
        wight and his or her weapon do not physically cross the intervening distance. A perfect wight can use improved
        legerdemain once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Incorporeal (Su):</b> At 3rd level, the perfect wight can become incorporeal once per day, plus one
        additional time per day every five levels thereafter. A perfect wight can remain incorporeal for a number of
        rounds equal to 20 + his or her perfect wight level. As an incorporeal creature, the perfect wight can be harmed
        only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, and
        supernatural abilities. He or she is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic
        weapons, the perfect wight has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for force
        effects<i> </i>or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). An incorporeal perfect wight has no natural armor but
        has a deflection bonus equal to his or her Charisma modifier (always at least +1, even if his or her Charisma
        score does not normally provide a bonus). An incorporeal perfect wight can pass through solid objects at will,
        but not force effects. His or her attack ignores natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses
        and force effects work normally against it. An incorporeal perfect wight moves silently and cannot be heard with
        Listen checks if he or she doesn’t wish to be. While incorporeal, the perfect wight has no Strength score, so
        his or her Dexterity modifier applies to both melee and ranged attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shadow Form (Su):</b> At 4th level, the perfect wight can take shadow form once per day, plus one additional
        time per day every five levels thereafter. The perfect wight’s shadow form lasts 1 minute per level of the
        prestige class. While in shadow form the perfect wight is incorporeal (see above), is immune to critical hits,
        and can fly at a speed of 100 feet (good). The perfect wight can also use the substance of his or her own shadow
        to enhance his or her effective level on any attack roll, check, or saving throw. Drawing power from his or her
        own shadow form deals the perfect wight 7 points of damage for each +1 bonus on a single roll or +1 effective
        level for any other single use.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feats:</b> The perfect wight gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every five
        levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Blinding Speed, Combat Archery,
        Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Dodge, Epic Reputation, Epic Skill Focus, Epic Speed, Epic
        Trapfinding, Improved Combat Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Legendary Climber, Lingering Damage,
        Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity, Spellcasting Harrier, Superior Initiative, Uncanny Accuracy.
      </p>
