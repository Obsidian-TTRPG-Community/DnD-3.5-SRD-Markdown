        <b>Aberration Type:</b> An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any
        combination of the three.
      </p>

      <p><i>Features: </i>An aberration has the following features.</p>

      <p>—d8 Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>.</p>

      <p>—Base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> equal to 3/4 total Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> (as <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a>).</p>

      <p>—Good Will saves.</p>

      <p>
        —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die.
      </p>

      <p><i>Traits: </i>An aberration possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>

      <p>—<a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">Darkvision</a> out to 60 feet.</p>

      <p>
        —Proficient with its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. If generally humanoid in form, proficient with all simple <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and any
        weapon it is described as using.
      </p>

      <p>
        —Proficient with whatever type of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> (<a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
        lighter types. Aberrations not indicated as wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> are not proficient with <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. Aberrations are
        proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>—Aberrations eat, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a>, and breathe.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Ability Score Loss (Su):</b> Some attacks reduce the opponent’s score in one or more abilities. This loss can
        be temporary (ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>) or permanent (ability drain).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Ability Damage: </i>This attack damages an opponent’s ability score. The creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> gives
        the ability and the amount of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. If an attack that causes ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> scores a critical hit, it deals
        twice the indicated amount of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (if the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is expressed as a die <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, roll two <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a>). Ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>
        returns at the rate of 1 point per day for each affected ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Ability Drain: </i>This effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s ability score when the creature hits
        with a melee attack. The creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> gives the ability and the amount drained. If an attack that
        causes ability drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice the indicated amount (if the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is expressed as
        a die <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, roll two <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a>). Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains
        5 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a> (10 on a critical hit) whenever it drains an ability score no matter how many points it
        drains. <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">Temporary hit points</a> gained in this fashion last for a maximum of 1 hour.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD + draining
        creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>). If no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is
        mentioned, none is allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume one or more specific
        alternate forms. This ability works much like the <i><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-25">polymorph</a> </i>spell, except that the creature is limited to
        the forms specified, and does not regain any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> for changing its form. Assuming an alternate form
        results in the following changes to the creature:
      </p>

      <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>

      <p>
        —The creature loses the natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> modes, and extraordinary <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a> of its
        original form.
      </p>

      <p>
        —The creature gains the natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> modes, and extraordinary <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a> of its
        new form.
      </p>

      <p>
        —The creature retains the special qualities of its original form. It does not gain any special qualities of its
        new form.
      </p>

      <p>
        —The creature retains the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of its old form (except for breath
        <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">gaze attacks</a>). It does not gain the spell-like abilities or supernatural attacks of its new form.
      </p>

      <p>
        —The creature gains the physical <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> (Str, Dex, Con) of its new form. It retains the mental ability
        scores (Int, Wis, Cha) of its original form.
      </p>

      <p>
        —The creature retains its <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> and save bonuses, although its save modifiers may change due to a change in
        <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        —The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak
        intelligibly to cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> with verbal <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> and it must have humanlike hands to cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> with somatic
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        —The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and it gains a +10 bonus on <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">Disguise</a>
        checks if it uses this ability to create a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">disguise</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Air Subtype:</b> This subtype usually is used for <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">elemental</a>s and outsiders with a connection to the <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">Elemental</a>
        Plane Air. Air creatures always have <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a> speeds and usually have perfect maneuverability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Angel Subtype:</b> Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned Outer

        +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> bonus on <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> to anyone within 20 feet of the <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-5">angel</a>.
        Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil </i>effect and a
        <i>lesser globe of invulnerability, </i>both with a radius of 20 feet (<a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> equals <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-5">angel</a>’s HD). (The
        defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-5">angel</a>’s <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-1-1">statistics block</a>.)
      </p>

This ability is always active.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Animal Type:</b> An animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with no magical abilities and

      <p>
        —Proficient with its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> only. A noncombative herbivore uses its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> as a secondary
        attack. Such attacks are made with a –5 penalty on the creature’s attack rolls, and the animal receives only 1/2

        special quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Archon Subtype:</b> Archons are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful good-aligned Outer
        <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>.
      </p>

      <p><i>Traits: </i>An <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-9">archon</a> possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>

      <p>—<a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">Darkvision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a> out to 60 feet and <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-22">low-light vision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a>.</p>

        resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-9">archon</a>’s aura for 24 hours.
      </p>

      <p>—Immunity to electricity and petrification.</p>

      <p>— +4 racial bonus on saves against <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>.</p>

      <p>
        —<a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-11">Magic Circle against Evil</a> (Su): A <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-11">magic circle against evil</a> effect always surrounds an <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-9">archon</a> (<a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>
        equals the <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-9">archon</a>’s Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-9">archon</a>’s
        <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-1-1">statistics block</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        —<a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-11">Tongues</a> (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a

      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augmented Subtype:</b> A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original
        type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they
        take on an acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original type. A
        creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original
        type.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense
        notices things it cannot see. The creature usually does not need to make <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> or <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks to pinpoint the
        location of a creature within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that
        creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see still has total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> against the creature with blindsense,
        and the creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>. Visibility still
        affects the <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity
        bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> against attacks from creatures it cannot see.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual
        senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature with
        blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-20">Invisibility</a>, <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>, and most kinds of
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> are irrelevant, though the creature must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that
        creature or object. The ability’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is specified in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>. The creature usually
        does not need to make <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> or <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks to notice creatures within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range </a> of its blindsight ability. Unless
        noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight,
        however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature
        must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>A <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a> attack usually deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and is often based on some type of
        <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a><a href="equipment.html#section-2">s</a> allow a Reflex save for half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creature’s racial HD + breathing
        creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>). A creature is immune to its
        own <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a> unless otherwise noted. Some <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a><a href="equipment.html#section-2">s</a> allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a
        Reflex save.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Change Shape (Su):</b> A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance of a
        specific creature or type of creature (usually a humanoid), but retains most of its own physical qualities. A
        creature cannot change shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form.
        Changing shape results in the following changes to the creature:
      </p>

      <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>

      <p>
        —The creature loses the natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> modes, and extraordinary <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a> of its original form.

      <p>—The creature gains the natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> modes, and extraordinary <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a> of its new form.</p>

      <p>
        —The creature retains all other <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a> and qualities of its original form, except for breath <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>
        and <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">gaze attacks</a>.
      </p>

      <p>—The creature retains the <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> of its original form.</p>

        <b>Chaotic Subtype: </b>A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>.
        Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s; however, if their <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s change they
        still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> affects a creature with this subtype as if the
        creature has a chaotic <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, no matter what its <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> actually is. The creature also suffers effects
        according to its actual <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> as if its

        <b>Damage Reduction (Ex or Su):</b> A creature with this special quality ignores <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> from most <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and
        natural attacks. Wounds <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">heal</a> immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent
        knows the attack was ineffective). The creature takes normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> attacks (even nonmagical ones),
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A certain kind of weapon can sometimes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> the
        creature normally, as noted below.
      </p>

      <p>
        The entry indicates the amount of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates
        the ability.

      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Some monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron.
        Attacks from <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> that are not made of the correct material have their <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> reduced, even if the weapon has
        an enhancement bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some monsters are vulnerable to magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. Any weapon with at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on attack
        and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls overcomes the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> of these monsters. Such creatures’ natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> (but not
        their attacks with <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>) are treated as magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> for the purpose of overcoming <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>; that is, magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> with at least a +6
        enhancement bonus. Such creatures’ natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> are also treated as epic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> for the purpose of

      </p>

      <p>
        Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. When a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> casts
        <i>align weapon, </i>affected <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> might gain one or more of these properties, and certain magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> have
        these properties as well. A creature with an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome
        this type of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> with its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> it wields as if the <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons </a> or natural
        <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> had an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> (or alignments) that match the subtype(s) of the creature.

      <p>When a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> entry has a dash (–) after the slash, no weapon negates the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>.</p>

      <p>
        A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either type overcomes this <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>
        reduction.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few other creatures require combinations of different types of attacks to overcome their <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>. A
        weapon must be both types to overcome this <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to

        as <i>restoration</i>. If a negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature
        must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier; the
        exact DC is given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>). On a success, the negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> goes away with no <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a>
        to the creature. On a failure, the negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> goes away, but the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is also reduced by one. A

        <b>Evil Subtype: </b>A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the evil-aligned Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>. Evil
        outsiders are also called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have evil <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s; however, if
        their <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> affects a creature
        with this subtype as if the creature has an evil <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, no matter what its <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment </a> actually is. The
        creature also suffers effects according to its actual <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. A creature with the evil subtype overcomes
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> as if its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons </a> and any <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> it wields were evil-aligned (see <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">Damage Reduction</a>,
        above).

      <p>
        <b>Extraplanar Subtype:</b> A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane.
        A creature that travels the <a href="planes.html">planes</a> can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries
        assume that encounters with creatures take place on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, and every creature whose native plane is
        not <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home plane). Every
        extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as
        extraplanar are natives of <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material
        Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a transitive plane, such as <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>, the

      <p>
        <i>Fear Aura (Su): </i>The use of this ability is a free action. The aura can freeze an opponent (such as a
        <a href="monsters-m-n.html#section-9">mummy</a>’s despair) or function like the <i><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> </i>spell. Other effects are possible. A <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> aura is an area
        effect. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> gives the size and kind of area.

      <p><i><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">Fear</a> Cones (Sp) and <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-27">Rays</a> (Su): </i>These effects usually work like the <i><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> </i>spell.</p>

      <p>
        If a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> effect allows a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>, it is a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>some creature’s racial HD +
        creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>). All <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> attacks are

      <p>
        <b>Fey Type:</b> A fey is a creature with supernatural abilities and connections to nature or to some other
        force or place. Fey are usually human-shaped.
      </p>

      <p><i>Features: </i>A fey has the following features.</p>

      <p>—6-sided Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>.</p>

      <p>—Base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> equal to 1/2 total Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> (as <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>).</p>

      <p>—Good Reflex and Will saves.</p>

      <p>
        —Skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die.
      </p>

      <p><i>Traits: </i>A fey possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>

      <p>—<a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-22">Low-light vision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a>.</p>

      <p>—Proficient with all simple <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and any <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> mentioned in its entry.</p>

      <p>
        —Proficient with whatever type of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> (<a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, medium, or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as
        all lighter types. Fey not indicated as wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor </a> are not proficient with <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. Fey are proficient with
        shields if they are proficient with any form of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>—Fey eat, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a>, and breathe.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Fire Subtype:</b> A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to fire. It has vulnerability to cold, which
        means it takes half again as much (+50%) <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as normal from cold, regardless of whether a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is
        allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Flight (Ex or Su):</b> A creature with this ability can cease or resume flight as a free action. If the
        ability is supernatural, it becomes ineffective in an <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-19">antimagic field</a>, and the creature loses its ability to <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a>
        for as long as the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> effect persists.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b> This special quality makes a creature’s very presence unsettling to foes. It
        takes effect automatically when the creature performs some sort of dramatic action (such as charging, attacking,
        or snarling). Opponents within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range </a> who witness the action may become frightened or shaken. Actions required to
        trigger the ability are given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is usually 30 feet, and the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>
        is usually 5d6 rounds. This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> or levels than the creature has.
        An affected opponent can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful creature’s racial
        HD + frightful creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>). An opponent
        that succeeds on the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is immune to that same creature’s frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful
        presence is a mind-affecting <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Gaze (Su):</b> A gaze special attack takes effect when opponents look at the creature’s eyes. The attack can
        have almost any sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is 30 feet, but check
        the creature’s entry for details. The type of <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a Will or
        Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD + gazing creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given
        in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>). A successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> negates the effect. A monster’s gaze attack is
        described in abbreviated form in its description. Each opponent within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of a gaze attack must attempt a
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> order. Only looking directly at a
        creature with a gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>
        by not looking at the creature, in one of two ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Averting Eyes: </i>The opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face, instead looking at its body, watching
        its <a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">shadow</a>, tracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not
        need to make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment </a> against that opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Wearing a Blindfold: </i>The opponent cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning
        one’s back on the creature or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze attack gains total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>
        against the opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>. That
        opponent must attempt a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an
        opponent to save against a creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before the opponent’s action and
        once during the creature’s turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">Gaze attacks</a> can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is immune to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">gaze attacks</a> of others of its kind unless
        otherwise noted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Allies of a creature with a gaze attack might be affected. All the creature’s allies are considered to be
        averting their eyes from the creature with the gaze attack, and have a 50% chance to not need to make a saving
        throw against the gaze attack each round. The creature also can <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-32">veil</a> its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.
      </p>

      <p><b>Giant Type:</b> A <a href="monsters-g.html#section-6">giant</a> is a humanoid-shaped creature of <a href="epic-feats.html#section-4-62">great strength</a>, usually of at least Large size.</p>

        lighter types. Giants not described as wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> are not proficient with <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. Giants are proficient with

      <p>—Giants eat, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a>, and breathe.</p>

        <b>Goblinoid Subtype:</b> Goblinoids are <a href="feats.html#section-3-98">stealthy</a> humanoids who live by hunting and raiding and who all speak
        <a href="monsters-g.html#section-11">Goblin</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Good Subtype:</b> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the good-aligned Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>. Most
        creatures that have this subtype also have good <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s; however, if their <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s change, they still
        retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature
        has a good <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, no matter what its <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to
        its actual <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. A creature with the good subtype overcomes <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> as if its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and
        any <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> it wields were good-aligned (see <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">Damage Reduction</a>, above).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Humanoid Type: </b>A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso, arms, and a
        head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually have
        well-developed societies. They usually are Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype.
      </p>

      <p>
        Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of a PC or NPC
        class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> warriors, which means that they have average combat
        ability and poor <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>.

      <p>
        Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die are the only humanoids who make use of the features of the humanoid type.

      <p>
        <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If a creature with this special attack hits with a melee weapon (usually a claw or
        bite attack), it deals normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and attempts to start a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple </a> as a free action without provoking an
        attack of opportunity. No initial touch attack is required. Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only
        against opponents at least one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct
        the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If
        it chooses to do the latter, it takes a –20 penalty on <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> checks, but is not considered <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>d itself;
        the creature does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use its remaining attacks
        against other opponents. A successful hold does not deal any extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> unless the creature also has the
        constrict special attack. If the creature does not constrict, each successful <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check it makes during
        successive rounds automatically deals the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise,
        it deals constriction <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as well (the amount is given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>). When a creature
        gets a hold after an improved grab attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. It can even move (possibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the
        opponent’s weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Incorporeal Subtype:</b> An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other
        incorporeal creatures, magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> or creatures that strike as magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, spell-like

        negative <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>, force effects such as <i>magic missile, </i>or attacks made with <i>ghost touch </i><a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>).
        Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a
        50% chance of not affecting an incorporeal creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        An incorporeal creature has no natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> bonus but has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus
        (always at least +1, even if the creature’s Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).
      </p>

      <p>
        An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain adjacent to the object’s
        exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the
        presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see farther
        from the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature
        inside an object has total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>, so a
        creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal creature cannot pass
        through a force effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        An incorporeal creature’s attacks pass through (ignore) natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, and shields, although deflection
        bonuses and force effects (such as <i>mage armor</i>) work normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass
        through and operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a>
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. Incorporeal creatures cannot make <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> or <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> attacks, nor can they be tripped or grappled. In fact,
        they cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>, nor are they
        subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off <a href="traps.html">traps</a> that are triggered by
        weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks if it doesn’t <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> to be. It has
        no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual
        senses, such as <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal
        creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> even when they
        cannot see.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Lawful: </b>A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>. Most
        creatures that have this subtype also have lawful <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s; however, if their <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>s change, they still
        retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature
        has a lawful <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, no matter what its <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to
        its actual <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> as if its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>
        and any <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> it wields were lawful-aligned (see <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">Damage Reduction</a>, above).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Low-Light <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35">Vision</a> (Ex):</b> A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-22">low-light vision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a> can see twice as far as a human in starlight,
        moonlight, torchlight, and similar <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> of shadowy illumination. It retains the ability to distinguish
        color and detail under these <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Magical Beast Type:</b> Magical beasts are similar to animals but can have Intelligence scores higher than 2.
        Magical beasts usually have supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but sometimes are merely bizarre in
        appearance or habits.
      </p>

      <p><i>Features: </i>A magical beast has the following features.</p>

      <p>—10-sided Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>.</p>

      <p>—Base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> equal to total Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> (as <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-5">fighter</a>).</p>

      <p>
        —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Traits: </i>A magical beast possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
      </p>

      <p>—<a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">Darkvision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a> out to 60 feet and <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-22">low-light vision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a>.</p>

      <p>—Proficient with its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> only.</p>

      <p>—Proficient with no <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.</p>

      <p>—Magical beasts eat, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a>, and breathe.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Manufactured <a href="equipment.html#section-2">Weapons</a>:</b> Some monsters employ manufactured <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> when they attack. Creatures that use
        swords, bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters, including those for additional attacks
        from a high base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> and <a href="feats.html#section-3-106">two-weapon fighting</a> penalties. This category also includes “found items,” such
        as rocks and logs, that a creature wields in combat— in essence, any weapon that is not intrinsic to the
        creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manufactured <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> when they make a full attack. When they do
        so, the manufactured weapon attack is considered the primary attack unless the creature’s description indicates
        otherwise and any natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> the creature also uses are considered secondary natural attacks. These
        secondary attacks do not interfere with the primary attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon does, but they
        take the usual –5 penalty (or –2 with the <a href="monster-feats.html#section-0-9">Multiattack </a> feat) for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used is
        normally the creature’s primary natural weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Monstrous Humanoid Type: </b>Monstrous humanoids are similar to humanoids, but with monstrous or animalistic
        features. They often have magical abilities as well.
      </p>

      <p><i>Features: </i>A monstrous humanoid has the following features.</p>

      <p>—8-sided Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>.</p>

      <p>
        —Proficient with whatever type of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> (<a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
        lighter types. Monstrous humanoids not indicated as wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> are not proficient with <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. Monstrous
        humanoids are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>—Monstrous humanoids eat, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a>, and breathe.</p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a> Modes: </b>Creatures may have modes of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> other than walking and running. These are natural,
        not magical, unless specifically noted in a monster description.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Burrow: </i>A creature with a burrow <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock unless the
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> says otherwise. Creatures cannot <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> or <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> while burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not
        leave behind tunnels other creatures can use (either because the material they tunnel through fills in behind
        them or because they do not actually dislocate any material when burrowing); see the individual creature
        descriptions for details.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Climb: </i>A creature with a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">climb</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> has a +8 racial bonus on all <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">Climb</a> checks. The creature must make a
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">Climb</a> check to <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">climb</a> any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 even if
        rushed or threatened while climbing. The creature climbs at the given <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> while <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">climb</a>ing. If it chooses an
        accelerated <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">climb</a> it moves at double the given <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">climb</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (or its base land <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, whichever is lower) and
        makes a single <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">Climb</a> check at a –5 penalty. Creatures cannot <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> while climbing. A creature retains its
        Dexterity bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks
        against a climbing creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Fly: </i>A creature with a <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> can move through the air at the indicated <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> if carrying no more than
        a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> load. (Note that medium <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> does not necessarily constitute a medium load.) All <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a> speeds include a
        parenthetical note indicating maneuverability, as follows:
      </p>

      <p>
        —Perfect: The creature can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> almost any aerial maneuver it wishes. It moves through the air as well as a
        human moves over smooth ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        —Good: The creature is very <a href="feats.html#section-3-3">agile</a> in the air (like a housefly or a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as
        readily as those with perfect maneuverability.
      </p>

      <p>—Average: The creature can <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a> as adroitly as a small bird.</p>

      <p>—Poor: The creature flies as well as a very large bird.</p>

      <p>—Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.</p>

      <p>
        A creature that flies can make dive attacks. A dive attack works just like a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, but the diving creature
        must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make only claw or talon attacks, but these
        deal double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. A creature can use the <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> action while flying, provided it flies in a straight line.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a>: </i>A creature with a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> can move through water at its <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed </a> without making <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a> checks.
        It has a +8 racial bonus on any <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a> check to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform </a> some special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can
        always can choose to take 10 on a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a> check, even if distracted or endangered. The creature can use the <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run </a>
        action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Native Subtype:</b> A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong
        connection to <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures
        can be. Creatures with this subtype are native to <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> (hence the subtype’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a>). Unlike true
        outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">Weapons</a>:</b> Natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> are <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> that are physically a part of a creature. A creature making
        a melee attack with a natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. Likewise,
        it threatens any space it can reach. Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>
        when using natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. The number of attacks a creature can make with its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> depends on the
        type of the attack—generally, a creature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore
        attack, one sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a
        slam attack with each arm). Refer to the individual monster descriptions.
      </p>

      <p>Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> of 20.</p>

      <p>
        When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the
        primary weapon. All the creature’s remaining natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> are secondary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary weapon is given in the creature’s Attack entry, and the primary weapon or <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> is given first in
        the creature’s Full Attack entry. A creature’s primary natural weapon is its most effective natural attack,
        usually by <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-34">virtue</a> of the creature’s physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon. An attack with a
        primary natural weapon uses the creature’s full <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>. Attacks with secondary natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> are less
        effective and are made with a –5 penalty on the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with the
        <a href="monster-feats.html#section-0-9">Multiattack</a> feat take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks.) This penalty applies even when the creature makes
        a single attack with the secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>Natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> have types just as other <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> do. The most common are summarized below.</p>

      <p><i>Bite: </i>The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p><i>Claw or Talon: </i>The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Gore: </i>The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p><i>Slap or Slam: </i>The creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Sting: </i>The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. Sting attacks usually deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> in addition to hit point <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Tentacle: </i>The creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes
        slashing) <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Nonabilities:</b> Some creatures lack certain <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>. These creatures do not have an ability score of
        0—they lack the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects of nonabilities are
        detailed below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Strength: </i>Any creature that can physically manipulate other objects has at least 1 point of Strength. A
        creature with no Strength score can’t exert force, usually because it has no physical body or because it doesn’t
        move. The creature automatically fails Strength checks. If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity
        modifier to its base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> instead of a Strength modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Dexterity: </i>Any creature that can move has at least 1 point of Dexterity. A creature with no Dexterity
        score can’t move. If it can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> actions (such as <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1">casting spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>), it applies its Intelligence modifier to
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> checks instead of a Dexterity modifier. The creature automatically fails Reflex saves and Dexterity
        checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Constitution: </i>Any living creature has at least 1 point of Constitution. A creature with no Constitution
        has no body or no metabolism. It is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works
        on objects or is harmless. The creature is also immune to ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, ability drain, and <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-61">energy drain</a>, and
        automatically fails Constitution checks. A creature with no Constitution cannot tire and thus can <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>
        indefinitely without tiring (unless the creature’s description says it cannot <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Intelligence: </i>Any creature that can think, learn, or remember has at least 1 point of Intelligence. A
        creature with no Intelligence score is mindless, an automaton operating on simple instincts or programmed
        instructions. It has immunity to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale
        effects) and automatically fails Intelligence checks.
      </p>

      <p>Mindless creatures do not gain <a href="feats.html">feats</a> or skills, although they may have bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a> or racial skill bonuses.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Wisdom: </i>Any creature that can perceive its environment in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom.
        Anything with no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a Wisdom score also has no Charisma
        score.

        <i>Charisma: </i>Any creature capable of telling the difference between itself and things that are not itself

        <b>Outsider Type: </b>An outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the
        material) of some plane other than <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>. Some creatures start out as some other type and become
        outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence.

      <p>—<a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">Darkvision</a> out to 60 feet.</p>

      <p>
        —Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a dual nature—its soul and body form one unit.
        When an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that restore souls to their bodies, such as

        lighter types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> are not proficient with <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. Outsiders are proficient
        with shields if they are proficient with any form of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        —Outsiders breathe, but do not need to eat or <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> (although they can do so if they <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a>). Native outsiders

      <p>
        <b>Paralysis (Ex or Su): </b>This special attack renders the victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move,
        speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a>, frozen and helpless. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-23">Paralysis</a> works on
        the body, and a character can usually resist it with a Fortitude <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (the DC is given in the creature’s
        description). Unlike <i>hold person </i>and similar effects, a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-23">paralysis</a> effect does not allow a new save each
        round. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A

        <b>Plant Type:</b> This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note that regular plants, such as one finds growing
        in gardens and fields, lack Wisdom and Charisma scores (see Nonabilities, above) and are not creatures, but

        —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
        Die, if the plant creature has an Intelligence score. However, some plant creatures are mindless and gain no

        <i>Traits: </i>A plant creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

      <p>—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p>

      <p>—Immunity to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> effects, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-23">paralysis</a>, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-25">polymorph</a>, and stunning.</p>

      <p>—Not subject to critical hits.</p>

      <p>—Proficient with its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> only.</p>

      <p>—Proficient with no <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.</p>

      <p>—Plants breathe and eat, but do not <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Poison (Ex):</b> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">Poison</a> attacks deal initial <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, such as ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (see page 305) or some other
        effect, to the opponent on a failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted, another <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is required 1
        minute later (regardless of the first save’s result) to avoid secondary <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. A creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>
        provides the details.
      </p>

      <p>A creature with a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> attack is immune to its own <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> and the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> of others of its kind.</p>

      <p>
        The Fortitude save DC against a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 poisoning creature’s racial HD + poisoning
        creature’s Con modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>).
      </p>

      <p>A successful save avoids (negates) the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> When a creature with this special attack makes a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, it can follow with a full
        attack—including rake attacks if the creature also has the rake ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Powerful Charge (Ex):</b> When a creature with this special attack makes a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, its attack deals extra
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>. The amount of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from the attack is given
        in the creature’s description.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">Psionics</a> (Sp):</b> These are spell-like abilities that a creature generates with the power of its mind.
        Psionic abilities are usually usable at will.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Rake (Ex):</b> A creature with this special attack gains extra natural attacks when it grapples its foe.
        Normally, a monster can attack with only one of its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons </a> while grappling, but a monster with the rake
        ability usually gains two additional claw attacks that it can use only against a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>d foe. Rake attacks are
        not subject to the usual –4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon in a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn grappling to use its rake—it can’t begin a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> and rake
        in the same turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ray (Su or Sp):</b> This form of special attack works like a ranged attack. Hitting with a ray attack
        requires a successful ranged touch <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>, ignoring <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, and <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> and using the
        creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>d <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>. Ray attacks have no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> increment. The creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> specifies
        the maximum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, effects, and any applicable <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">Regeneration</a> (Ex): </b>A creature with this ability is difficult to kill. <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a> dealt to the creature is
        treated as <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a>. The creature automatically heals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> at a fixed rate per round, as
        given in the entry. Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal lethal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the creature, which
        doesn’t go away. The creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> describes the details. A regenerating creature that has been
        rendered unconscious through <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> can be killed with a coup de grace. The attack cannot be of a type
        that automatically converts to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attack forms that don’t deal hit point <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> ignore <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">regeneration</a>. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">Regeneration</a> also does not restore <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>
        lost from starvation, thirst, or <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-9">suffocation</a>. Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their bodies
        and can reattach severed limbs or body parts; details are in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>. Severed parts that
        are not reattached wither and die normally.
      </p>

      <p>A creature must have a Constitution score to have the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">regeneration</a> ability.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Reptilian Subtype: </b>These creatures are scaly and usually coldblooded. The reptilian subtype is only used
        to describe a set of humanoid <a href="races.html">races</a>, not all animals and monsters that are truly reptiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-29">Resistance to Energy</a> (Ex):</b> A creature with this special quality ignores some <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> of the indicated type
        each time it takes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> of that kind (commonly acid, cold, fire, or electricity). The entry indicates the
        amount and type of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> ignored.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Scent (Ex):</b> This special quality allows a creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes,
        and <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a> by sense of smell. Creatures with the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> ability can <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> familiar odors just as <a href="races.html#section-1">humans</a> do
        familiar sights.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>
        increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be
        detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or <a href="monsters-t-z.html#section-8">troglodyte</a> stench, can be
        detected at triple normal <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a creature detects a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a>, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere
        within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>. The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Whenever the creature comes within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the source’s location.</p>

      <p>
        A creature with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">Track</a> feat and the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> ability can follow <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a>s by smell, making a Wisdom (or <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-18">Survival</a>)
        check to find or follow a <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a>. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds
        the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a>). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of
        creatures, and the <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-2-1">age</a> of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability
        otherwise follows the rules for the <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">Track</a> feat. Creatures tracking by <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent </a> ignore the effects of surface
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> and poor visibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shapechanger Subtype:</b> A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate forms.
        Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes has the
        shapechanger subtype.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Traits: </i>A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
      </p>

      <p>
        —Proficient with its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, with simple <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, and with any <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons </a> mentioned in the creature’s
        description.
      </p>

      <p>
        —Proficient with any <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> mentioned in the creature’s description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of
        <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient with <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. A shapechanger is proficient with shields if
        it is proficient with any type of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Sonic Attacks (Su):</b> Unless otherwise noted, a sonic attack follows the rules for spreads. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of
        the spread is measured from the creature using the sonic attack. Once a sonic attack has taken effect, deafening
        the subject or stopping its ears does not end the effect. Stopping one’s ears ahead of time allows opponents to
        avoid having to make <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> against mind-affecting sonic attacks, but not other kinds of sonic attacks
        (such as those that deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>). Stopping one’s ears is a full-round action and requires wax or other
        soundproof material to stuff into the ears.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">Special Abilities</a>:</b> A special ability is either extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Extraordinary: </i>Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical, don’t become ineffective in an

        a free action unless otherwise noted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Spell-Like: </i>Spell-like abilities are magical and work just like <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> (though they are not <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and so
        have no verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>). They go away in an <i>antimagic field </i>and are

      <p>
        A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A spell-like ability that can be used at
        will has no use limit. Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so
        while threatened provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. It is possible to make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check to use a
        spell-like ability defensively and avoid provoking an attack of opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A
        spell-like ability can be disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell,
        nor can they be counterspelled.
      </p>

      <p>
        For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> defines how difficult it is to dispel their
        spell-like effects and to define any <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>-dependent variables (such as <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> and <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>) <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-2">the abilities</a> might
        have. The creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> never affects which spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the given
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> is lower than the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the same <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a>. If
        no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> is specified, the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> is equal to the creature’s Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (if any)
        against a spell-like ability is 10 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s
        Cha modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some spell-like abilities duplicate <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that work differently when cast by characters of different classes<i>. </i>A monster’s spell-like abilities are presumed to be the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a>/<a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> versions. If the spell in question is
        not a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a>/<a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> spell, then default to <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a>, <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-4">druid</a>, <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a>, <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-1">paladin</a>, and <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a>, in that order.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Supernatural: </i>Supernatural abilities are magical and go away in an <i>antimagic field </i>but are not
        subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>. Supernatural abilities cannot be dispelled. Using a supernatural ability is a
        standard action unless noted otherwise. Supernatural abilities may have a use limit or be usable at will, just
        like spell-like abilities. However, supernatural abilities do not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> and never
        require <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> checks. Unless otherwise noted, a supernatural ability has an effective <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> equal
        to the creature’s Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (if any) against a supernatural ability is 10 + 1/2 the creature’s
        HD + the creature’s ability modifier (usually Charisma).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell Immunity (Ex): </b>A creature with <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-53">spell immunity</a> avoids the effects of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities
        that directly affect it. This works exactly like <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>, except that it cannot be overcome. Sometimes
        <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-53">spell immunity</a> is conditional or applies to only <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> of a certain kind or <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that do not allow
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> are not affected by <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-53">spell immunity</a>.

      <p>
        <b>Spell Resistance (Ex): </b>A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> can avoid the effects of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells </a> and spell-like
        abilities that directly affect it.To determine if a spell or spell-like ability works against a creature with
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>, the caster must make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"> </a> check (1d20 + <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>). If the result equals or
        exceeds the creature’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>, the spell works normally, although the creature is still allowed a
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a>:</b> Sometimes a creature can cast arcane or <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> just as a member of a spellcasting class
        can (and can activate magic items accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the same spellcasting rules that
        characters are, except as follows.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide any somatic component a spell might require by
        moving its body. Such a creature also does need material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> for its <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. The creature can cast the
        spell by either touching the required component (but not if the component is in another creature’s possession)
        or having the required component on its person. Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize the <a href="feats.html#section-3-31">Eschew Materials</a>
        feat to avoid fussing with noncostly <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any
        class abilities. A creature with access to <a href="spell-list-i.html#section-2">cleric spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> must prepare them in the normal manner and receives
        domain <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> if noted, but it does not receive domain granted powers unless it has at least one <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in the
        <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Summon </i></b><b>(Sp):</b> A creature with the <i>summon </i>ability can summon specific other creatures
        of its kind much as though casting a <i>summon monster </i>spell, but it usually has only a limited chance of
        success (as specified in the creature’s entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons. Summoned
        creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been summoned cannot use
        its own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures with the ability to summon do not use it lightly, since it
        leaves them beholden to the summoned creature. In general, they use it only when necessary to save their own
        lives. An appropriate spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is given for each summoning ability for purposes of <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> checks and
        attempts to dispel the summoned creature. No experience points are awarded for summoned monsters.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> If a creature with this special attack begins its turn with an opponent held in its
        mouth (see Improved Grab), it can attempt a new <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it
        succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be
        up to one size category smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed has various consequences,
        depending on the creature doing the swallowing. A swallowed creature is considered to be grappled, while the
        creature that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>
        slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> required to get free is noted in the creature
        description), or it can just try to escape the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>. The <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> of the interior of a creature that
        swallows whole is normally 10 + 1/2 its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor </a> bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If the
        swallowed creature escapes the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>, success puts it back in the attacker’s mouth, where it may be bitten or
        swallowed again.

        <b><a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">Swarm</a> Subtype:</b> A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single
        creature. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> has a single pool of Hit
        <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, a single <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> modifier, a single <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, and a single <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> makes
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> as a single creature. A single <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures)
        or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In
        order to attack, it moves into an opponent’s space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the
        same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> can move through squares
        occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> provokes an attack of opportunity if
        it does so. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> can move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> of Diminutive
        creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> of Fine creatures consists of
        10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">Swarm</a>s of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than
        could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> are packed
        tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a>s are
        represented by multiples of single <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a>s. The area occupied by a large <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> is completely shapeable, though
        the <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> usually remains in contiguous squares.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Traits: </i>A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical
        hits or <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-4">flanking</a>. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> made up of Tiny creatures takes half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from slashing and piercing <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. A
        <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. Reducing a <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> to 0 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>
        or lower causes it to break up, though <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or
        resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. Also, they cannot be tripped,
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>d, or bull rushed, and they cannot <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> an opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> such as <i>disintegrate</i>), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,
        phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> has an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> takes
        half again as much <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (+50%) from <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or effects that affect an area, such as splash <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and many
        evocation <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a
        <i>gust of wind </i>spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a>, treat the <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> as a
        creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> rendered unconscious by means of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> exceed its <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a>.

        <i><a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">Swarm</a> Attack: </i>Creatures with the <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">swarm</a> subtype don’t make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal

        <a href="monsters-s.html#section-17">Swarm</a> attacks are not subject to a miss chance for <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> or <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>.

        <b><a href="feats.html#section-3-104">Trample</a> (Ex):</b> As a full-round action, a creature with this special attack can move up to twice its <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>
        and literally <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> over any opponents at least one size category smaller than itself. The creature merely has to
        move over the opponents in its path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling creature’s
        space is subject to the <a href="feats.html#section-3-104">trample</a> attack. If a target’s space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered
        trampled if the trampling creature moves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves over
        only some of a target’s space, the target can make an attack of opportunity against the trampling creature at a
        –4 penalty. A trampling creature that accidentally ends its <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> in an illegal space returns to the last
        legal position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="feats.html#section-3-104">trample</a> attack deals bludgeoning <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (the creature’s slam <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> + 1-1/2 times its Str modifier). The
        creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> gives the exact amount.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trampled opponents can attempt <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>, but these take a –4 penalty. If they do not make attacks
        of opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt Reflex saves to take half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The save DC against a creature’s <a href="feats.html#section-3-104">trample</a> attack is 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD + creature’s Str modifier (the exact
        DC is given in the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>). A trampling creature can only deal trampling <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to each
        target once per round, no matter how many times its <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> takes it over a target creature.

        <b><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-32">Tremorsense</a> (Ex): </b>A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-32">tremorsense</a> is sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can
        automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground. Aquatic creatures with
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-32">tremorsense</a> can also sense the location of creatures moving through water. The ability’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is specified in
        the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="treasure.html">Treasure</a>:</b> This entry in a monster description describes how much wealth a creature owns. In most cases, a
        creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a> with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures
        that own useful, portable <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a> (such as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at
        home. <a href="treasure.html">Treasure</a> can include <a href="equipment.html#section-1-1">coins</a>, goods, and items. Creatures can have varying amounts of each, as follows.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Standard: </i>Refer to the <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a> tables<i> </i>and roll d% once for each type of <a href="treasure.html">treasure </a> (<a href="equipment.html#section-1-1">Coins</a>, Goods,
        Items) on the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a> section of the table that corresponds to the creature’s Challenge Rating (for groups of
        creatures, use the Encounter <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a> for the encounter instead). Some creatures have double, triple, or even
        quadruple standard <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a>; in these cases, roll for each type of <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a> two, three, or four times.
      </p>

      <p><i>None: </i>The creature collects no <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a> of its own.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Nonstandard: </i>Some creatures have quirks or habits that affect the types of <a href="treasure.html">treasure </a> they collect. These
        creatures use the same
      </p>

      <p><a href="treasure.html">treasure</a> tables, but with special adjustments.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Fractional <a href="equipment.html#section-1-1">Coins</a>: </i>Roll on the <a href="equipment.html#section-1-1">Coins</a> column in the section corresponding to the creature’s Challenge
        Rating, but divide the result as indicated.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>% Goods or Items: </i>The creature has goods or items only some of the time. Before checking for goods or
        items, roll d% against the given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll on the appropriate Goods or Items
        column (which may still result in no goods or items).
      </p>

      <p><i>Double Goods or Items: </i>Roll twice on the appropriate Goods or Items column.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Parenthetical Notes: </i>Some entries for goods or items include notes that limit the types of <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a> a
        creature collects.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a note includes the word “no,” it means the creature does not collect or cannot keep that thing. If a
        random roll generates such a result, treat the result as “none” instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a note includes the word “only,” the creature goes out of its way to collect <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a> of the indicated
        type. Treat all results from that column as the indicated type of <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a>.
      </p>

      <p>It’s sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort of item appears.</p>

        <b><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-33">Turn Resistance</a> (Ex): </b>A creature with this special quality (usually an undead) is less easily affected by
