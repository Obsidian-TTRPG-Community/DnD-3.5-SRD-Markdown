      <h2 id="section-1">ACQUIRING EPIC FEATS</h2>

      <p>Characters gain epic feats in the following ways:</p>

      <p>
        At 21st level, and every three levels thereafter, the character may select an epic feat in place of a nonepic
        feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each character class gains bonus epic feats according to the class description. These feats must be selected
        from the list of bonus epic feats for that class.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2">PREREQUISITES</h2>

      <p>
        Most epic feats have prerequisites. A character must have the listed ability score, feat, skill, class feature,
        or base attack modifier in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain an epic feat at the same level
        at which he or she gains the prerequisite, just as with regular feats. A prerequisite expressed as a numerical
        value is a minimum; any value higher than the one given also meets the prerequisite. A character can’t use an
        epic feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-3">TYPES OF EPIC FEATS</h2>

      <p>
        Most epic feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others may be item creation
        feats or metamagic feats, which follow all the normal rules for such feats, except as specified in the feat’s
        description. In addition, some feats are defined as divine feats or as wild feats. Such feats are described
        below.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-1">DIVINE FEATS</h3>

      <p>
        The feats in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all have as a prerequisite the ability to
        turn (or, in most cases, rebuke) undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level or higher, and
        any prestige class that has that ability. (An ability to turn other creatures does not qualify a character to
        select one of these feats.) Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to channel positive or
        negative energy to turn or rebuke undead. Each use of a divine feat costs the character one turn/rebuke attempt
        from his or her number of attempts each day. If a character doesn’t have any turn/rebuke attempts left, he or
        she can’t use the feat. Since turning or rebuking is a standard action, activating any of these feats is also a
        standard action.

      <h3 id="section-3-2">WILD FEATS</h3>

      <p>
        The feats in this category share the characteristic of relating to the ability to use <i>wild shape </i>as a
        druid. These feats require the character to have the ability to use <i>wild shape </i>before acquiring the feat.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-3">EPIC PSIONIC FEATS</h3>

      <p>
        Psionic characters can acquire epic “psionically flavored” feats.&nbsp; Some feats require so much translation
        that converted feats are provided. Whenever a feat concerns conferring or altering a spell in some fashion, some
        translation must be done to use it with psionics. Sometimes this translation is as straightforward as changing a
        few names. Translating epic metamagic feats to epic metapsionic feats requires that Spellcraft prerequisites be
        replaced with Psicraft. It also requires a little math—instead of casting a spell at a higher level, a psionic
        character pays more power points. For every spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level the
        metamagic feat requires, the metapsionic feat requires a character to pay a power point cost equal to its
        standard cost +2. Likewise, when a feat allows a spellcaster to “pay” one less level to use a metamagic feat,
        the psionic version allows a character to pay 2 power points less for a given metapsionic feat.
      </p>

        powerful than normal by adding +20 to the DC required to create it and multiplying its price by 5. If the item
        or substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage, double the
        duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage and doesn’t have a specific listed duration
        (or has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn’t fit any
        of these categories, then it cannot be affected by this feat. See the Craft (alchemy) skill description.

        <b>Special:</b> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, the spells
        of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be silenced with no adjustment to their spell slots. This
        feat doesn’t increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in
        metamagic form. However, since bard spells can’t be enhanced with the Silent Spell feat, they can’t be affected
        by this feat either.

        song. The character can choose to exclude any characters from this effect. The character may sing, play, or
        recite a deafening song while taking other mundane actions, but not magical ones (see the bard’s inspire courage
        ability for more details). The character may keep up the deafening song for a maximum of 10 rounds. Using the
        deafening song counts as one of the character’s uses of song or poetics for the day.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-20">DEATH OF ENEMIES <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Bane of Enemies, Survival 30 ranks, five or more favored enemies.</p>

        followers, and so on (round fractions up, except any fraction less than 1 rounds to 0). A character can’t have a

        level.
      </p>

        Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression
        continues infinitely in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level,
        expand the table to follow the same patterns as shown.

      <h3 id="section-5-1">IMPROVED SPELL RESISTANCE <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Must have spell resistance from a feat, class feature, or other permanent effect.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> The character’s spell resistance increases by +2.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.</p>

      <h3 id="section-5-2">IMPROVED STUNNING FIST <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Dex 19, Wis 19, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> Add +2 to the DC of the character’s stunning attack.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> This feat may be taken multiple times. Its effects stack.</p>

      <h3 id="section-5-3">IMPROVED WHIRLWIND ATTACK <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Int 13, Dex 23, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> As a standard action, the character can make one melee attack for every five points of his or
        her base attack bonus (including epic attack bonus, round fractions down).
      </p>

      <p>
        The character cannot attack any one opponent more than once as part of this action.&nbsp; These attacks (as well
        as all other attacks made until the start of the character’s next turn) suffer a –4 penalty.
      </p>

      <p>
        When using the Improved Whirlwind feat, the character also forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other
        spells or abilities (such as Cleave or the haste spell).
      </p>

      <p>
        Since these attacks are made as part of a standard action the character can’t make a 5-foot step between any two
        of the attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, using the Whirlwind Attack feat requires a full attack action, and the
        character can take a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-4">INCITE RAGE <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p>Prerequisites: Cha 25, greater rage class feature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When the character enters a rage, he or she can incite a barbarian rage in any or all allies
        within 60 feet. (Any ally who doesn’t wish to become enraged is unaffected.) The ally gains +4 to Strength, +4
        to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a –2 penalty to AC, for as long as the character
        remains raging. The rage of affected allies lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier,
        regardless of whether they remain within 60 feet of the character. This is otherwise identical with normal
        barbarian rage (including the fatigue at its end).
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <h3 id="section-5-5">INFINITE DEFLECTION <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 25, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> The character may perform any number of deflections each round, as the Deflect Arrows feat.</p>

      <h3 id="section-5-6">INSPIRE EXCELLENCE <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Perform 30 ranks, bardic music class feature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character can use song or poetics to grant a bonus to one ability score to his or her
        allies. To be affected, an ally must hear the bard sing for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the bard
        sings and for 5 rounds after the bard stops singing (or 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the bard).
        While singing, the bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as
        scrolls), or activate magic items by command word (such as wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4
        competence bonus to the same ability score, which the character must choose before he or she begins inspiring.
        Inspire excellence is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability. Use of this feat counts as one of the character’s
        bardic music uses for the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> This feat is treated as a bardic music inspiration ability for purposes of feats that affect
        such abilities.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-7">INSTANT RELOAD <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Weapon Focus (crossbow type to be selected).</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character may fire the selected type of crossbow at his or her full normal attack rate.
        Reloading the crossbow does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a character
        takes the feat, it applies to a different type of crossbow.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-8">INTENSIFY SPELL [METAMAGIC]<small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Prerequisites:</b> Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Spellcraft 30 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or
        divine spells.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> All variable, numeric effects of an intensified spell are maximized, then doubled. An
        intensified spell deals twice maximum damage, cures twice the maximum number of hit points, affects twice the
        maximum number of targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. An
        intensified spell uses up a spell slot seven levels higher than the spell’s actual level. A character can’t
        combine the effects of this feat with any other feat that affects the variable, numeric effects of a spell.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-9">KEEN STRIKE <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 23, Wis 23, Improved Critical (unarmed strike), Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning
        fist, <i>ki </i>strike (adamantine).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character’s unarmed strike has a critical threat range of 18-20 and deals slashing damage
        (at the character’s option any attack can deal bludgeoning damage, but cannot then take advantage of the
        enhanced threat range). This ability doesn’t stack with other abilities that expand that character’s unarmed
        strike’s threat range.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-10">LASTING INSPIRATION <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Perform 25 ranks, bardic music class feature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The effects of the character’s bardic music inspiration abilities last for ten times as long as
        normal after he or she stops singing. This feat has no effect on inspiration abilities that have no duration
        after the character stops singing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-11">LEGENDARY CLIMBER <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 21, Balance 12 ranks, Climb 24 ranks.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character can ignore any check penalties applied for accelerated climbing or rapid climbing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, a character takes a –5 penalty on Climb checks when attempting to cover his or
        her full speed in climbing distance in a round, or a –20 penalty when attempting to cover twice his or her speed
        in climbing distance in a round.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-12">LEGENDARY COMMANDER <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Prerequisites:</b> Cha 25, Epic Leadership, Leadership, Diplomacy 30 ranks, must rule own kingdom and have a
        stronghold.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Multiply the number of followers of each level that the character can lead by 10. This has no
        effect on cohorts.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-13">LEGENDARY LEAPER <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Jump 24 ranks.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> The character need only move 5 feet in a straight line to make a running jump.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, a character must move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting a
        running jump.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-14">LEGENDARY RIDER <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Ride 24 ranks.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character doesn’t take a penalty on Ride checks when riding a mount without a saddle
        (bareback).&nbsp; The character never needs to make a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and even
        controlling a mount not trained for combat doesn’t require an action).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, a character takes a –5 penalty on Ride checks without a saddle, and must make
        a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and controlling a mount not trained for combat requires a move
        action).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-15">LEGENDARY TRACKER <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Wis 25, Track, Knowledge (nature) 30 ranks, Survival 30 ranks.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character can track creatures across water, under-water, or through the air. This adds the
        surfaces of water, underwater, and air to the list of surfaces found under the Track feat:

        <b>Normal:</b> A creature without this feat can make only one attack per round with each extra weapon (or two
        attacks per round with each weapon if it has Multiweapon Fighting, or three attacks per round with each extra

        <b>Benefit:</b> Designate any one of the character’s spells whose area is an emanation from the character. This

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Every undead creature that comes within 15 feet of the character is automatically affected as if
        the character had turned it. This doesn’t cost a turning attempt, and the character doesn’t have to roll turning
        damage (it automatically affects all undead in a 15-foot burst), but it only turns undead with Hit Dice equal to
        or less than the character’s effective cleric level minus 10 (and automatically destroys undead with Hit Dice
        equal to or less than the character’s effective cleric level minus 20). Just as with normal turning, the

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character can begin a countersong at any time, even when it isn’t his or her turn (much like
        a wizard who has readied a counterspell action), though the character doesn’t have to ready an action to do so.
        The character can’t use Reactive Countersong at the same time he or she isusing another bardic music ability
        (though the character could stop the other bardic music ability to begin Reactive Countersong if so desired).

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Attacks against the character have a 10% miss chance, similar to the effect of concealment. The

        dealing normal damage), make a Concentration check rather than a Strength check. The break DC remains the same.

        Shattering Strike to escape bonds (unless he or she is so bound as to allow the character to make an unarmed
        strike against his or her bindings).
      </p>

        uses this magic, the character also immediately gains the magic’s effect as if it had been used on the character
        by the same caster. The character must have direct line of effect to the spellcaster in order to gain the
        benefit of the attuned magic (though the character does not have to know the spellcaster is present, and he or
        she can be flat-footed). The magic’s duration, effect, and other specifics are determined by its original
        caster’s level.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a character

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Spellcraft 15 ranks.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Choose one spell the character knows or spell-like ability the character possesses. Whenever the
        chosen form of magic would otherwise end due to a <i>dispel </i>effect, the magic is instead only suppressed for
        1d4 rounds. The magic still ends when its duration expires, but the suppressed rounds do not count against its
        duration. The character can dismiss his or her own spell or spell-like ability (if dismissible) or dispel his or
        her own tenacious magic normally.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it applies to

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Any weapon the character wields while in a rage is treated as a thundering weapon. The DC of the

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Search 25 ranks, Spot 25 ranks, trapfinding class ability.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> If the character hits an opponent with a weapon in each hand in the same round, he or she may
        automatically rend the opponent. This deals additional damage equal to the base damage of the smaller weapon
        plus 1 1/2 times the character’s Strength modifier. Base weapon damage includes an enhancement bonus on damage,
        if any. The character can only rend once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks he or she makes.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-65">UNCANNY ACCURACY <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

        concealment.&nbsp; The character must aim his or her attacks at the correct square to gain advantage of this
        feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, characters suffer a 50% miss chance when making a ranged attack against a
        target with total concealment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A character with at least 11 levels of ranger can qualify for this feat even if he or she does

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Smite good class feature, any evil alignment.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Any weapon the character wields is treated as an unholy weapon (it is evil-aligned and deals an
        extra 2d6 points of damage against creatures of good alignment). This ability doesn’t stack with similar
        abilities. If the weapon already has an alignment, this feat has no effect on the weapon.
      </p>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Knowledge (nature) 24 ranks, <i>wild shape </i>6/day.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 25, Wis 25, Improved Critical (unarmed strike), Improved Unarmed Strike, Keen Strike,
        Stunning Fist, <i>ki </i>strike (adamantine).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character’s unarmed strike is considered to be a slashing vorpal weapon. (At the character’s
        option, any unarmed strike can do bludgeoning damage instead, but it loses the vorpal quality.) This ability
        doesn’t stack with similar abilities
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-70">WIDEN AURA OF COURAGE <small>[EPIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Cha 25, aura of courage class ability.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The character can use a rebuke or command undead attempt to animate corpses within range of his
        or her rebuke or command attempt. The character animates a total number of HD of undead equal to the number of
        undead that would be commanded by the character’s result (though the character can’t animate more undead than
        there are available corpses within range). The character can’t animate more undead with any single attempt than
        the maximum number he or she can command (including any undead already under his or her command). These undead
        are automatically under the character’s command, though his or her normal limit of commanded undead still
        applies. If the corpses are relatively fresh, the animated undead are zombies. Otherwise, they are skeletons.

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> If the standard action taken by a creature during a round in which it uses Flyby Attack is a

        target.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, a creature making an attack as part of a Flyby Attack maneuver provokes
