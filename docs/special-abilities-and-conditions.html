      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">SPECIAL ABILITIES</a></h2>

      <p>A special ability is either extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural in nature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):</b> Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something
        that just anyone can do or even learn to do without extensive training. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt
        magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):</b> Spell-like abilities, as the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a> implies, are <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and magical abilities
        that are very much like <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. Spell-like abilities are subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> and <i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">dispel magic</a></i>.
        They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-19">antimagic field</a></i>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Supernatural Abilities (Su):</b> Supernatural abilities are magical but not spell-like. Supernatural
        abilities are not subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated
        (such as an <i>antimagic field</i>). A supernatural ability’s effect cannot be dispelled and is not subject to
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-3">counterspells</a>. See the table below for a summary of the types of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>.

      <h3 id="section-1-1"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-1">ABILITY SCORE LOSS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Various attacks cause <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-1">ability score loss</a>, either ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> or ability drain. Points lost to ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>
        return at the rate of 1 point per day (or double that if the character gets complete bed rest) to each damaged
        ability, and the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> <i>lesser <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-70">restoration</a> </i>and <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-70">restoration</a> </i>offset ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as well. Ability
        drain, however, is permanent, though <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-70">restoration</a> </i>can restore even those lost ability score points.
      </p>

      <p>While any loss is debilitating, losing all points in an ability score can be devastating.</p>

      <p>• Strength 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He lies helpless on the ground.</p>

      <p>• Dexterity 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He stands motionless, rigid, and helpless.</p>

      <p>• Constitution 0 means that the character is dead.</p>

      <p>• Intelligence 0 means that the character cannot think and is unconscious in a coma-like stupor, helpless.</p>

      <p>• Wisdom 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a deep <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> filled with nightmares, helpless.</p>

      <p>• Charisma 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a catatonic, coma-like stupor, helpless.</p>

      <p>
        Keeping <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a> of negative ability score points is never necessary. A character’s ability score can’t drop below
        0.
      </p>

      <p>Having a score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score whatsoever.</p>

      <p>
        Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or abilities impose an effective ability score reduction, which is different from ability score
        loss. Any such reduction disappears at the end of the spell’s or ability’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, and the ability score
        immediately returns to its former value.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a character’s Constitution score drops, then he loses 1 hit point per Hit Die for every point by which his
        Constitution modifier drops. A hit point score can’t be reduced by Constitution <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> or drain to less than 1
        hit point per Hit Die.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ability that some creatures have to drain <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> is a supernatural one, requiring some sort of
        attack. Such creatures do not drain abilities from enemies when the enemies strike them, even with unarmed
        attacks or natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-2"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">ANTIMAGIC</a></h3>

      <p>
        An <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-19">antimagic field</a> </i>spell or effect cancels magic altogether. An <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> effect has the following powers
        and characteristics.
      </p>

      <p>
        • No supernatural ability, spell-like ability, or spell works in an area of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> (but extraordinary
        abilities still work).
      </p>

      <p>
        • <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">Antimagic</a> does not <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">dispel magic</a>; it suppresses it. Once a magical effect is no longer affected by the
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> (the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> fades, the center of the effect moves away, and so on), the magic returns. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that
        still have part of their <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> left begin functioning again, magic items are once again useful, and so forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Spell areas that include both an <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> area and a normal area, but are not centered in the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> area,
        still function in the normal area. If the spell’s center is in the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> area, then the spell is suppressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Golems and other constructs, elementals, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still function in an <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> area
        (though the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> area suppresses their spellcasting and their supernatural and spell-like abilities
        normally). If such creatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Summoned or conjured creatures of any type, as well as incorporeal undead, wink out if they enter the area of
        an <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> effect. They reappear in the same <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a> once the field goes away.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Magic items with continuous effects<i> </i>do not function in the area of an <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic </a> effect, but their
        effects are not canceled (so the contents of a <i>bag of holding</i> are unavailable, but neither spill out nor
        disappear forever).
      </p>

      <p>• Two <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a> areas in the same place do not cancel each other out, nor do they stack.</p>

      <p>
        • <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-38">Wall of force</a>, prismatic wall, </i>and <i>prismatic sphere </i>are not affected by <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a>.
        <i>Break enchantment, dispel magic, </i>and <i>greater dispel magic </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> do not dispel <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a>.
        <i><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-3">Mage’s disjunction</a> </i>has a 1% chance per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> of destroying an <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-19">antimagic field</a>. </i>If the
        <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-19">antimagic field</a> </i>survives the <i>disjunction, </i>no items within it are disjoined.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-3"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-3">BLINDSIGHT AND BLINDSENSE</a></h3>

      <p>
        Some creatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense (or a combination of such
        senses) to operate effectively without <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35">vision</a>. Such sense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a>,
        keen hearing, or echolocation. This ability makes <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-20">invisibility</a> and <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> (even magical <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>)
        irrelevant to the creature (though it still can’t see ethereal creatures). This ability operates out to a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>
        specified in the creature description.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with
        blindsight.
      </p>

      <p>• Blindsight does not subject a creature to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">gaze attacks</a> (even though <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">darkvision</a> does).</p>

      <p>• Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight.</p>

      <p>• Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.</p>

      <p>• Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.</p>

      <p>• Blindsight negates <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-45">displacement</a> and <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-48">blur</a> effects.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Blindsense:</b> Other creatures have blindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it
        cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> or <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks to notice and locate creatures within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of its blindsense ability, provided that it
        has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> (50% miss
        chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance
        when attacking foes that have <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>. Visibility still affects the <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> of a creature with blindsense.
        A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> against attacks from creatures it
        cannot see.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-4"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">BREATH WEAPON</a></h3>

      <p>
        A creature attacking with a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a> is actually expelling something from its mouth (rather than conjuring
        it by means of a spell or some other magical effect). Most creatures with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a><a href="equipment.html#section-2">s</a> are limited to a number
        of uses per day or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures are usually smart
        enough to save their <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a> until they really need it.
      </p>

      <p>• Using a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a> is typically a standard action.</p>

      <p>• No <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated area.</p>

      <p>
        • Any character caught in the area must make the appropriate <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> or suffer the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-4">breath weapon</a>’s full
        effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds on his <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> still takes half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> or some other
        reduced effect.
      </p>

      <p>• Breath <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> are supernatural abilities except where noted.</p>

      <p>• Creatures are immune to their own breath <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>.</p>

      <p>• Creatures unable to breathe can still use breath <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. (The term is something of a misnomer.)</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-5"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-5">CHARM AND COMPULSION</a></h3>

      <p>
        Many abilities and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can cloud the minds of characters and monsters, leaving them unable to tell friend
        from foe—or worse yet, deceiving them into thinking that their former friends are now their worst enemies. Two
        general types of enchantments affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Charming another creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and suggest courses of actions to
        his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or mindless. Charms of this type include the various
        <i>charm </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. Essentially, a <i>charmed </i>character retains free will but makes choices according to a
        skewed view of the world.
      </p>

      <p>• A <i>charmed </i>creature doesn’t gain any magical ability to understand his new friend’s language.</p>

      <p>
        • A <i>charmed </i>character retains his original <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> and allegiances, generally with the exception that
        he now regards the <i>charming </i>creature as a dear friend and will give great weight to his suggestions and
        directions.
      </p>

      <p>
        • A <i>charmed </i>character fights his former allies only if they threaten his new friend, and even then he
        uses the least lethal means at his disposal as long as these tactics show any possibility of success (just as he
        would in a fight between two actual friends).
      </p>

      <p>
        • A <i>charmed </i>character is entitled to an opposed Charisma check against his master in order to resist
        instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn’t normally do even for a close friend. If he
        succeeds, he decides not to go along with that order but remains <i>charmed.</i>
      </p>

      <p>• A <i>charmed </i>character never obeys a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to her.</p>

      <p>
        • If the charming creature commands his minion to do something that the influenced character would be violently
        opposed to, the subject may attempt a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw </a> to break free of the influence altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        • A <i>charmed </i>character who is openly attacked by the creature who <i>charmed </i>him or by that creature’s
        apparent allies is automatically freed of the spell or effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compulsion is a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject’s free will in some way or
        simply changes the way the subject’s mind works. A charm makes the subject a friend of the caster; a compulsion
        makes the subject obey the caster.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he won’t volunteer information or tactics that his
        master doesn’t ask for.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-6"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-6">COLD IMMUNITY</a></h3>

      <p>
        A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-6">cold immunity</a> never takes cold <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half
        again as much (+50%) <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as normal from fire, regardless of whether a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is allowed, or if the save
        is a success or failure.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-7"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">DAMAGE REDUCTION</a></h3>

      <p>
        Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">heal</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> or to ignore blows
        altogether as though they were invulnerable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The numerical part of a creature’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> is the amount of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> the creature ignores from normal
        attacks. Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction </a> number by a slash. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">Damage reduction</a> may be overcome by <a href="special-materials.html">special materials</a>, by magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> (any
        weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus, not counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain
        types of <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> (such as slashing or bludgeoning), and <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> imbued with an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. If a dash follows the
        slash then the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> is effective against any attack that does not ignore <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-21">magic weapon</a>
        for the purpose of overcoming <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an
        <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment </a> gains the <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> of that projectile weapon (in addition to any <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> it may already have).
      </p>

      <p>
        Whenever <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> completely negates the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from an attack, it also negates most special effects
        that accompany the attack, such as injury type <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>, a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-6">monk</a>’s stunning, and injury type <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a>. <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a>
        reduction does not negate touch attacks, <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt along with an attack, or <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> drains. Nor does it
        affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.
      </p>

      <p>Attacks that deal no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> because of the target’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> do not disrupt <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a>, spell-like abilities, and <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> attacks (even nonmagical fire) ignore <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Sometimes <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> is instant <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a>. Sometimes <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction </a> represents the creature’s tough <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a>
        or body,. In either case, characters can see that conventional attacks don’t work.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a creature has <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> from more than one source, the two forms of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> do not stack.
        Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the best <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> in a given situation.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-8"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">DARKVISION</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">Darkvision</a> is the extraordinary ability to see with no <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> source at all, out to a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range </a> specified for the
        creature. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">Darkvision</a> is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see
        anything that they could not see otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still
        visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">darkvision</a> subjects a creature to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">gaze attacks</a> normally. The presence
        of <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> does not spoil <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">darkvision</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-9"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-9">DEATH ATTACKS</a></h3>

      <p>
        In most cases, a death attack allows the victim a Fortitude save to avoid the affect, but if the save fails, the
        character dies instantly.
      </p>

      <p>• <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-47">Raise dead</a> </i>doesn’t work on someone killed by a death attack.</p>

      <p>• <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-9">Death attacks</a> slay instantly. A victim cannot be made stable and thereby kept alive.</p>

      <p>• In case it matters, a dead character, no matter how she died, has –10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>.</p>

      <p>• The spell <i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-8">death ward</a> </i>protects a character against these attacks.</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-10"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">DISEASE</a></h3>

      <p>
        When a character is injured by a contaminated attack touches an item smeared with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a>d matter, or consumes
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a>-tainted food or drink, he must make an immediate Fortitude <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. If he succeeds, the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a> has
        no effect—his immune system fought off the infection. If he fails, he takes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> after an incubation period.
        Once per day afterward, he must make a successful Fortitude <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> to avoid repeated <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. Two
        successful <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> in a row indicate that he has fought off the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a> and recovers, taking no more
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        These Fortitude <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> can be rolled secretly so that the player doesn’t know whether the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a> has
        taken hold.
      </p>

      <h4><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">Disease</a> Descriptions</h4>

      <p>
        Diseases have various symptoms and are spread through a number of vectors. The characteristics of several
        typical diseases are summarized on Table: Diseases and defined below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">Disease</a>: </i>Diseases whose names are printed in <i>italic </i>in the table are supernatural in nature. The
        others are extraordinary.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Infection: </i>The <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a>’s method of delivery—ingested, inhaled, via injury, or contact. Keep in mind that
        some injury diseases may be transmitted by as small an injury as a flea bite and that most inhaled diseases can
        also be ingested (and vice versa).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>DC: </i>The Difficulty Class for the Fortitude <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> to prevent infection (if the character has been
        infected), to prevent each instance of repeated <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, and to recover from the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a>.
      </p>

      <p><i>Incubation Period: </i>The time before <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> begins.</p>

      <p><i><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a>: </i>The ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> the character takes after incubation and each day afterward.</p>

      <p><b>Types of Diseases: </b>Typical diseases include the following:</p>

      <p><i>Blinding Sickness: </i>Spread in tainted water.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Cackle Fever: </i>Symptoms include high fever, disorientation, and frequent bouts of <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-16">hideous laughter</a>. Also
        known as “the shrieks.”
      </p>

      <p><i><a href="monsters-d-de.html#section-3">Demon</a> Fever: </i>Night hags spread it. Can cause permanent ability drain.</p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="monsters-d-de.html#section-6">Devil</a> Chills: </i>Barbazu and pit fiends spread it. It takes three, not two, successful saves in a row to
        recover from <a href="monsters-d-de.html#section-6">devil</a> chills.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Filth Fever: </i>Dire rats and otyughs spread it. Those injured while in filthy surroundings might also catch
        it.
      </p>

      <p><i>Mindfire: </i>Feels like your brain is burning. Causes stupor.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Mummy Rot: </i>Spread by mummies. Successful <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> do not allow the character to recover (though they
        do prevent <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> normally).
      </p>

      <p><i>Red Ache: </i>Skin turns red, bloated, and warm to the touch.</p>

      <p><i>The Shakes: </i>Causes involuntary twitches, tremors, and fits.</p>

      <p><i>Slimy <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-54">Doom</a>: </i>Victim turns into infectious goo from the inside out. Can cause permanent ability drain.</p>

      <p>
        Use of the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> skill can help a diseased character. Every time a diseased character makes a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>

        Characters recover points lost to ability score <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> at a rate of 1 per day per ability damaged, and this rule

      <p>
        Some horrible creatures, especially undead monsters, possess a fearsome supernatural ability to drain <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s
        from those they strike in combat. The creature making an <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-61">energy drain</a> attack draws a portion of its victim’s
        life force from her. Most <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-61">energy drain</a> attacks require a successful melee <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>—mere physical contact is
        not enough. Each successful <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-61">energy drain</a> attack bestows one or more negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s on the opponent. A creature
        takes the following penalties for each negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> it has gained.

        each negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If the victim casts <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, she loses access to one spell as if she had cast her highest-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, currently
        available spell. (If she has more than one spell at her highest <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, she chooses which she loses.) In
        addition, when she next prepares <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or regains spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her highest
        spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Negative levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as <i>restoration. </i>After 24 hours,
        the afflicted creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 attacker’s HD + attacker’s Cha modifier). (The
        DC is provided in the attacker’s description.) If the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> succeeds, the negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> goes away with
        no <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm </a> to the creature. The afflicted creature makes a separate <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> for each negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> it has
        gained. If the save fails, the negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> goes away, but the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is also reduced by one.
      </p>

      <p>
        A character with negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s at least equal to her current <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, or drained below 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, is instantly
        slain. Depending on the creature that killed her, she may rise the next night as a monster of that kind. If not,
        she rises as a <a href="monsters-t-z.html#section-14">wight</a>. A creature gains 5 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a> for each negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> it bestows (though not if
        the negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is caused by a spell or similar effect).

      <h3 id="section-1-12"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-12">ETHEREALNESS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Phase spiders and certain other creatures can exist on <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>. While on <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>, a
        creature is called ethereal. Unlike incorporeal creatures, ethereal creatures are not present on the Material
        Plane.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ethereal creatures are invisible, inaudible, insubstantial, and scentless to creatures on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>.
        Even most magical attacks have no effect on them. <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-13">See invisibility</a> </i>and <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-23">true seeing</a> </i>reveal ethereal
        creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        An ethereal creature can see and hear into <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> in a 60-foot radius, though material objects still
        block sight and sound. (An ethereal creature can’t see through a material wall, for instance.) An ethereal
        creature inside an object on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> cannot see. Things on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, however, look gray,
        indistinct, and ghostly. An ethereal creature can’t affect <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, not even magically. An ethereal
        creature, however, interacts with other ethereal creatures and objects the way material creatures interact with
        material creatures and objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if a creature on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> can see an ethereal creature the ethereal creature is on another plane.
        Only force effects can affect the ethereal creatures. If, on the other hand, both creatures are ethereal, they
        can affect each other normally.
      </p>

      <p>
        A force effect originating on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> extends onto <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>, so that a
        <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-38">wall of force</a> </i>blocks an ethereal creature, and a <i>magic missile </i>can strike one (provided the
        spellcaster can see the ethereal target). Gaze effects and abjurations also extend from <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> to
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>. None of these effects extend from <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a> to <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ethereal creatures move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground,
        and material objects don’t block them (though they can’t see while their eyes are within solid material).
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghosts have a power called manifestation that allows them to appear on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> as incorporeal
        creatures. Still, they are on <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>, and another ethereal creature can interact normally with a
        manifesting <a href="monsters-g.html#section-4">ghost</a>. Ethereal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as air. Ethereal creatures do
        not fall or take <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-13"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-13">EVASION AND IMPROVED EVASION</a></h3>

      <p>
        These extraordinary abilities allow the target of an area attack to leap or twist out of the way. Rogues and
        monks have <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-13">evasion and improved evasion</a> as <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a>, but certain other creatures have these abilities,
        too.
      </p>

      <p>
        If subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex save for half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, a character with evasion takes no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on
        a successful save.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with a Reflex save for any creature, a character must have room to move in order to evade. A bound character
        or one squeezing through an area cannot use evasion.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with a Reflex save for any creature, evasion is a reflexive ability. The character need not know that the
        attack is coming to use evasion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rogues and monks cannot use evasion in medium or heavy <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. Some creatures with the evasion ability as an
        innate quality do not have this limitation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Improved evasion is like evasion, except that even on a failed <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> the character takes only half
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-14"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-14">FAST HEALING</a><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6"></a></h3>

      <p>
        A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-14">fast healing</a><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6"></a> has the extraordinary ability to regain <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> at an exceptional rate. Except
        for what is noted here, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-14">fast healing</a><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6"></a> is like natural <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the beginning of each of the creature’s turns, it heals a certain number of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (defined in its
        description).
      </p>

      <p>Unlike <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">regeneration</a>, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-14">fast healing</a><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6"></a> does not allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts.</p>

      <p>A creature that has taken both nonlethal and lethal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> heals the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> first.</p>

      <p><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-14">Fast healing</a><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6"></a> does not restore <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> lost from starvation, thirst, or <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-9">suffocation</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-14">Fast healing</a><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6"></a> does not increase the number of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> regained when a creature polymorphs.</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-15"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">FEAR</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a>, magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>. In most cases, the character makes a
        Will <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> to resist this effect, and a failed roll means that the character is shaken, frightened, or
        panicked.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shaken: </b>Characters who are shaken take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>, and
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-3">ability checks</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Frightened:</b> Characters who are frightened are shaken, and in addition they flee from the source of their
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> as quickly as they can. They can choose the path of their flight. Other than that stipulation, once they
        are out of sight (or hearing) of the source of their <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>, they can act as they want. However, if the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>
        of their <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear </a> continues, characters can be forced to flee once more if the source of their <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear </a> presents itself
        again. Characters unable to flee can fight (though they are still shaken).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Panicked: </b>Characters who are panicked are shaken, and they <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> away from the source of their <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> as
        quickly as they can. Other than running away from the source, their path is random. They flee from all other
        dangers that confront them rather than facing those dangers. Panicked characters cower if they are prevented
        from fleeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Becoming Even More Fearful:</b> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">Fear</a> effects are cumulative. A shaken character who is made shaken again
        becomes frightened, and a shaken character who is made frightened becomes panicked instead. A frightened
        character who is made shaken or frightened becomes panicked instead.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-16"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-16">FIRE IMMUNITY</a></h3>

      <p>
        A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-16">fire immunity</a> never takes fire <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half
        again as much (+50%) <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as normal from cold, regardless of whether a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is allowed, or if the save
        is a success or failure.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-17"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-17">GASEOUS FORM</a></h3>

      <p>Some creatures have the supernatural or spell-like ability to take the form of a cloud of vapor or gas.</p>

      <p>
        Creatures in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-17">gaseous form</a> can’t <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> but can <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a>. A gaseous creature can move about and do the things that a
        cloud of gas can conceivably do, such as flow through the crack under a door. It can’t, however, pass through
        solid matter. Gaseous creatures can’t attack physically or cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> with verbal, somatic, material, or focus
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>. They lose their supernatural abilities (except for the supernatural ability to assume <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-17">gaseous form</a>,
        of course).
      </p>

      <p>
        Creatures in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-17">gaseous form</a> have <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> 10/magic. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a>, spell-like abilities, and supernatural
        abilities affect them normally. Creatures in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-17">gaseous form </a> lose all benefit of material <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> (including natural
        <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>), though size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> bonuses from force <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> still apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gaseous creatures do not need to breathe and are immune to attacks involving breathing (<a href="monsters-t-z.html#section-8">troglodyte</a> stench,
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> gas, and the like).
      </p>

      <p>
        Gaseous creatures can’t enter water or other liquid. They are not ethereal or incorporeal. They are affected by
        winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving.
        However, even the strongest wind can’t disperse or <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> a creature in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-17">gaseous form</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Discerning a creature in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-17">gaseous form</a> from natural mist requires a DC 15 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check. Creatures in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-17">gaseous form</a>
        attempting to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> in an area with mist, smoke, or other gas gain a +20 bonus.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-18"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">GAZE ATTACKS</a></h3>

      <p>
        While the <a href="monsters-m-n.html#section-3">medusa</a>’s gaze is well known, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">gaze attacks</a> can also charm, curse, or even kill. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">Gaze attacks</a> not
        produced by a spell are supernatural.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each character within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of a gaze attack must attempt a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (which can be a Fortitude or Will save)
        each round at the beginning of his turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        An opponent can avert his eyes from the creature’s face, looking at the creature’s body, watching its <a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">shadow</a>, or
        tracking the creature in a reflective surface. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance of not having to make a
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. The creature with the gaze attack gains <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> relative to the opponent. An opponent can shut
        his eyes, turn his back on the creature, or wear a blindfold. In these cases, the opponent does not need to make
        a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. The creature with the gaze attack gains total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> relative to the opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature with a gaze attack can actively attempt to use its gaze as an attack action. The creature simply
        chooses a target within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, and that opponent must attempt a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. If the target has chosen to defend
        against the gaze as discussed above, the opponent gets a chance to avoid the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (either 50% chance for
        averting eyes or 100% chance for shutting eyes). It is possible for an opponent to save against a creature’s
        gaze twice during the same round, once before its own action and once during the creature’s action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the creature’s image (such as in a mirror or as part of an illusion) does not subject the viewer to a
        gaze attack.
      </p>

      <p>A creature is immune to its own gaze attack.</p>

      <p>
        If visibility is limited (by dim lighting, a fog, or the like) so that it results in <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>, there is a
        percentage chance equal to the normal miss chance for that degree of <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> that a character won’t need to
        make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> in a given round. This chance is not cumulative with the chance for averting your eyes, but
        is rolled separately.
      </p>

      <p>Invisible creatures cannot use <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">gaze attacks</a>.</p>

      <p>Characters using <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">darkvision</a> in complete <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a> are affected by a gaze attack normally.</p>

      <p>
        Unless specified otherwise, a creature with a gaze attack can control its gaze attack and “turn it off ” when so
        desired.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-19"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-19">INCORPOREALITY</a></h3>

      <p>
        Spectres, wraiths, and a few other creatures lack physical bodies. Such creatures are insubstantial and can’t be
        touched by nonmagical matter or <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>. Likewise, they cannot manipulate objects or exert physical force on
        objects. However, incorporeal beings have a tangible presence that sometimes seems like a physical attack
        against a corporeal creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incorporeal creatures are present on the same plane as the characters, and characters have some chance to affect
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incorporeal creatures can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, by magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, or by <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>,
        spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. They are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. They are not burned
        by normal fires, affected by natural cold, or harmed by mundane acids.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when struck by magic or magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, an incorporeal creature has a 50% chance to ignore any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from a
        corporeal source—except for a force effect<i> </i>or <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt by a <a href="monsters-g.html#section-4">ghost</a> touch weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incorporeal creatures are immune to critical hits, extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from being favored enemies, and from sneak
        attacks. They move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground. They
        can pass through solid objects at will, although they cannot see when their eyes are within solid matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incorporeal creatures hiding inside solid objects get a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks, because solid
        objects carry sound well. Pinpointing an opponent from inside a solid object uses the same rules as pinpointing
        invisible opponents (<a href="spells-s.html#section-0-13">see Invisibility</a>, below).
      </p>

      <p>Incorporeal creatures are inaudible unless they decide to make noise.</p>

      <p>
        The physical attacks of incorporeal creatures ignore material <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, even magic <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, unless it is made of
        force (such as <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-1">mage armor</a> or bracers of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>) or has the <a href="monsters-g.html#section-4">ghost</a> touch ability.

      <p>
        Incorporeal creatures do not leave footprints, have no <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a>, and make no noise unless they manifest, and even
        then they only make noise intentionally.

      <h3 id="section-1-20"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-20">INVISIBILITY</a></h3>

      <p>
        The ability to move about unseen is not foolproof. While they can’t be seen, invisible creatures can be heard,
        smelled, or felt.
      </p>

      <p><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-20">Invisibility</a> makes a creature undetectable by <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35">vision</a>, including <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">darkvision</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-20">Invisibility</a> does not, by itself, make a creature immune to critical hits, but it does make the creature immune
        to extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from being a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a>’s favored enemy and from sneak attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a>
        check. The observer gains a hunch that “something’s there” but can’t see it or target it accurately with an
        attack. A creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an unliving
        creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature is even harder to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a> (DC 40). It’s practically
        impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature’s location with a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check, and even if a character
        succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature still benefits from total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> (50% miss chance).
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature. A character can make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> check for this purpose
        as a free action each round. A <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> check result at least equal to the invisible creature’s <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-7">Move Silently</a>
        check result reveals its presence. (A creature with no ranks in <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-7">Move Silently</a> makes a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-7">Move Silently</a> check as a
        Dexterity check to which an <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> check penalty applies.) A successful check lets a character hear an invisible
        creature “over there somewhere.” It’s practically impossible to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature.
        A <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the invisible creature’s location.

      <p>
        A creature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A character can make a touch attack with his hands or
        a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard action. If an invisible target is in the designated
        area, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> but
        has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature’s current location. (If the invisible creature moves, its
        location, obviously, is once again unknown.)
      </p>

      <p>
        If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck still knows the location of the creature that
        struck him (until, of course, the invisible creature moves). The only exception is if the invisible creature has
        a reach greater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general location of the creature but
        has not pinpointed the exact location.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally, but
        the invisible creature still benefits from full <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment </a> (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large
        and <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-42">slow</a> creature might get a smaller miss chance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not pinpointed, have the player
        choose the space where the character will direct the attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the
        attack normally. If the enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don’t let the player see
        the result, and tell him that the character has missed. That way the player doesn’t know whether the attack
        missed because the enemy’s not there or because you successfully rolled the miss chance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. One could coat an invisible
        object with flour to at least keep <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a> of its position (until the flour fell off or blew away). An invisible
        creature can pick up a small visible item and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind a cloak) and
        render it effectively invisible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft surfaces
        can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s location.
      </p>

      <p>
        An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The invisible creature, however, is
        still hard to see and benefits from <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>.
      </p>

      <p>A creature with the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a visible one.</p>

      <p>
        A creature with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-11">Blind-Fight</a> feat has a better chance to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance
        twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll rather
        than two 50% miss chance rolls.)
      </p>

      <p>A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures regardless of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-20">invisibility</a>.</p>

      <p>
        An invisible burning torch still gives off <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, as does an invisible object with a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light </a> spell (or similar
        spell) cast upon it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ethereal creatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not materially present, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> checks, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a>
        checks, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">Scent</a>, <a href="feats.html#section-3-11">Blind-Fight</a>, and blindsight don’t help locate them. Incorporeal creatures are often invisible.
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">Scent</a>, <a href="feats.html#section-3-11">Blind-Fight</a>, and blindsight don’t help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal creatures, but
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> checks and possibly <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks can help.
      </p>

      <p>Invisible creatures cannot use <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-18">gaze attacks</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-20">Invisibility</a> does not thwart <i>detect </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be able to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> even when
        invisible.

      <p>
        A character who loses a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> instantly loses one Hit Die. The character’s base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, base <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>
        bonuses, and special class abilities are now reduced to the new, lower <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. Likewise, the character loses any
        ability score gain, skill ranks, and any feat associated with the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> (if applicable). If the exact ability
        score or skill ranks increased from a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> now lost is unknown (or the player has forgotten), lose 1 point from
        the highest ability score or ranks from the highest-ranked skills. If a familiar or companion creature has
        abilities tied to a character who has lost a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, the creature’s abilities are adjusted to fit the character’s
        new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.

        Characters with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-22">low-light vision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a> have eyes that are so sensitive to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> that they can see twice as far as

      <h3 id="section-1-23"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-23">PARALYSIS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Some monsters and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have the supernatural or spell-like ability to paralyze their victims, immobilizing
        them through magical means. (<a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-23">Paralysis</a> from toxins is discussed in the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">Poison</a> section below.)
      </p>

      <p>
        A paralyzed character cannot move, speak, or take any physical action. He is rooted to the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a>, frozen and
        helpless. Not even friends can move his limbs. He may take purely mental actions, such as casting a spell with
        no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim</a>mer can’t <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim</a> and may drown.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-24"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">POISON</a></h3>

      <p>
        When a character takes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from an attack with a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>ed weapon, touches an item smeared with contact
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>, consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise poisoned, he must make a Fortitude <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. If he
        fails, he takes the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>’s initial <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (usually ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>). Even if he succeeds, he typically faces
        more <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a successful Fortitude <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        One dose of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single target. A <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>ed weapon or
        object retains its venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched (unless the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> is wiped off
        before a target comes in contact with it). Any <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> smeared on an object or exposed to the elements in any way
        remains potent until it is touched or used.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although supernatural and spell-like poisons are possible, poisonous effects are almost always extraordinary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poisons can be divided into four basic types according to the method by which their effect is delivered, as
        follows.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Contact:</b> Merely touching this type of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> necessitates a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. It can be actively delivered
        via a weapon or a touch attack. Even if a creature has sufficient <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> to avoid taking any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>
        from the attack, the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> can still affect it. A chest or other object can be smeared with contact <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> as
        part of a trap.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ingested:</b> Ingested poisons are virtually impossible to utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could
        administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into drinking or eating something
        poisoned. Assassins and other characters tend to use ingested poisons outside of combat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Inhaled:</b> Inhaled poisons are usually contained in fragile vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>d attack with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), the
        container releases its <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>. One dose spreads to fill the volume of a 10-foot cube. Each creature within the
        area must make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons; they affect the
        nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Injury:</b> This <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> must be delivered through a wound. If a creature has sufficient <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> to
        avoid taking any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from the attack, the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> does not affect it. <a href="traps.html">Traps</a> that cause <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>,
        needles, and the like sometimes contain injury poisons.
      </p>

      <p>The characteristics of poisons are summarized on Table: Poisons. Terms on the table are defined below.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Type: </i>The <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>’s method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or via an injury) and the Fortitude
        save DC to avoid the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Initial Damage: </i>The <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> the character takes immediately upon failing his <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against this
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>. Ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is temporary unless marked with an asterisk (*), in which case the loss is a permanent
        drain. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-23">Paralysis</a> lasts for 2d6 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Secondary Damage: </i>The amount of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> the character takes 1 minute after exposure as a result of the
        poisoning, if he fails a second <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3 hours. Ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> marked with an
        asterisk is permanent drain instead of temporary <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Price: </i>The cost of one dose (one vial) of the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>. It is not possible to use or apply <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> in any
        quantity smaller than one dose. The purchase and possession of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison </a> is always illegal, and even in big cities
        it can be obtained only from specialized, less than reputable sources.

        A character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> whenever he applies it to a weapon or otherwise
        readies it for use. Additionally, a character who rolls a natural 1 on an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> with a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>ed weapon
        must make a DC 15 Reflex save or accidentally <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> himself with the weapon.
      </p>

      <h4><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">Poison</a> Immunities</h4>

      <p>
        Creatures with natural <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> attacks are immune to their own <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>. Nonliving creatures (constructs and
        undead) and creatures without metabolisms (such as elementals) are always immune to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>. Oozes, plants, and
        certain kinds of outsiders are also immune to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>, although conceivably special poisons could be concocted
        specifically to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> them.

      <h3 id="section-1-25"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-25">POLYMORPH</a></h3>

      <p>
        Magic can cause creatures and characters to change their shapes—sometimes against their will, but usually to
        gain an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retain their own minds but have new physical forms.
      </p>

      <p>The <i><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-25">polymorph</a> </i>spell defines the general <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-25">polymorph</a> effect.</p>

      <p>
        Since creatures do not change types, a slaying or <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-32">bane</a> weapon designed to kill or <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> creatures of a specific
        type affects those creatures even if they are polymorphed. Likewise, a creature polymorphed into the form of a
        creature of a different type is not subject to slaying and <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-32">bane</a> effects directed at that type of creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a>’s favored enemy bonus is based on knowing what the foe is, so if a creature that is a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a>’s favored
        enemy polymorphs into another form, the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a> is denied his bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="monsters-dr-dw.html#section-8">dwarf</a> ’s bonus for fighting <a href="monsters-g.html#section-6">giant</a>s is based on shape and size, so he does not gain a bonus against a <a href="monsters-g.html#section-6">giant</a>
        polymorphed into something else, but does gain the bonus against any creature polymorphed into a <a href="monsters-g.html#section-6">giant</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-26"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">PSIONICS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Telepathy, mental combat and psychic powers—<a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> is a catchall word that describes special mental abilities
        possessed by various creatures. These are spell-like abilities that a creature generates from the power of its
        mind alone—no other outside magical force or ritual is needed. Each psionic creature’s description contains
        details on its psionic abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Psionic attacks almost always allow Will <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> to resist them. However, not all psionic attacks are
        mental attacks. Some psionic abilities allow the psionic creature to reshape its own body, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">heal</a> its wounds, or
        <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-4">teleport</a> great distances. Some <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">psionic creatures</a> can see into the future, the past, and the present (in far-off
        locales) as well as read the minds of others.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-27"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-27">RAYS</a></h3>

      <p>
        All ray attacks require the attacker to make a successful ranged touch attack against the target. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-27">Rays</a> have
        varying <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>s, which are simple maximums. A ray’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll </a> never takes a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> penalty. Even if a ray hits,
        it usually allows the target to make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (Fortitude or Will). <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-27">Rays</a> never allow a Reflex <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>,
        but if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC is high, it might be hard to hit her with the ray in the first place.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-28"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">REGENERATION</a></h3>

      <p>
        Creatures with this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow or reattach severed
        body parts. <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a> dealt to the creature is treated as <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a>, and the creature automatically cures
        itself of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> at a fixed rate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the creature normally; that sort of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> doesn’t
        convert to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> and so doesn’t go away. The creature’s description includes the details.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creatures with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">regeneration</a> can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body
        parts. Severed parts die if they are not reattached.
      </p>

      <p><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">Regeneration</a> does not restore <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> lost from starvation, thirst, or <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-9">suffocation</a>.</p>

      <p>Attack forms that don’t deal hit point <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> ignore <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-28">regeneration</a>.</p>

      <p>
        An attack that can cause instant death only threatens the creature with death if it is delivered by <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> that
        deal it lethal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-29"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-29">RESISTANCE TO ENERGY</a></h3>

      <p>
        A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-29">resistance to energy</a> has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> of a certain
        type each round, but it does not have total immunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> ability is defined by what <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> type it resists and how many points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> are resisted. It
        doesn’t matter whether the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> has a mundane or magical source.
      </p>

      <p>
        When <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> completely negates the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from an <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell. This
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> does not stack with the <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> that a spell<i> </i>might provide.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-30"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">SCENT</a></h3>

      <p>
        This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a> by sense
        of smell.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature with the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the
        opponent is upwind, the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke
        or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or
        <a href="monsters-t-z.html#section-8">troglodyte</a> stench, can be detected at three times these ranges.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> is a move action. If it moves within 5 feet of the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a>’s source, the creature can pinpoint that source.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">Track</a> feat and the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> ability can follow <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a>s by smell, making a Wisdom check to find
        or follow a <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a>. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong
        the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-2-1">age</a> of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold,
        the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">Track</a> feat. Creatures tracking by <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a>
        ignore the effects of surface <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> and poor visibility.
      </p>

      <p>Creatures with the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> ability can <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> familiar odors just as <a href="races.html#section-1">humans</a> do familiar sights.</p>

      <p>
        Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that
        have the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> ability, however, can use it in the water easily.
      </p>

      <p>
        False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the ability
        to properly detect or <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> creatures, and the base <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-18">Survival</a> DC to <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a> becomes 20 rather than 10.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-31"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">SPELL RESISTANCE</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. (Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> also grant spell
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        To affect a creature that has <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>, a spellcaster must make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"> </a> check (1d20 + <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>) at least equal to the creature’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>. (The defender’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> is like an <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a>
        Class against magical attacks.) If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the creature. The
        possessor does not have to do anything special to use <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>. The creature need not even be aware of
        the threat for its <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> to operate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities are subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities
        (including enhancement bonuses on magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> and some that are not. Even some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> ignore <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>; see When <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell Resistance</a>
        Applies, below.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature can voluntarily lower its <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke an
        attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a>, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At
        the beginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> automatically returns unless the
        creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity).
      </p>

      <p>A creature’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> never interferes with its own <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, items, or abilities.</p>

      <p>
        A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> cannot impart this power to others by touching them or standing in their midst.
        Only the rarest of creatures and a few magic items have the ability to bestow <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> upon another.
      </p>

      <p><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> does not stack. It overlaps.</p>

      <h4>When <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell Resistance</a> Applies</h4>

      <p>
        Each spell includes an entry that indicates whether <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> applies to the spell. In general, whether
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> applies depends on what the spell does:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Targeted <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a>:</b> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some individually
        targeted <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can be directed at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a creature’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> applies only to the portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several different
        resistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> separately.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Area <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a>:</b> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> applies if the resistant creature is within the spell’s area. It protects
        the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Effect <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a>:</b> Most effect <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> summon or create something and are not subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>.
        Sometimes, however, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> applies to effect <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, usually to those that act upon a creature more or
        less directly, such as <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-48">web</a>.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast. Check <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> when the
        creature is first affected by the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Check <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a spell-like ability. If <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> fails the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same casting of the spell.
        Likewise, if the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has voluntarily
        lowered its <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist
        that spell later, when its <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> is up.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> has no effect unless the <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> created or released by the spell actually goes to work on the
        resistant creature’s mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and the creature is affected as a
        consequence, no roll is required. Creatures can be harmed by a spell without being directly affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> does not apply if an effect fools the creature’s senses or reveals something about the
        creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Magic actually has to be working for <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> to apply. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that have instantaneous durations but
        lasting results aren’t subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> unless the resistant creature is exposed to the spell the
        instant it is cast.
      </p>

      <p>When in doubt about whether a spell’s effect is direct or indirect, consider the spell’s school:</p>

      <p>
        <b>Abjuration:</b> The target creature must be harmed, changed, or restricted in some manner for <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> to apply. Perception changes aren’t subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Abjurations that block or negate attacks are not subject to an attacker’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>—it is the protected
        creature that is affected by the spell (becoming immune or resistant to the attack).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Conjuration:</b> These <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are usually not subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> unless the spell conjures some form
        of <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a><i>. </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that summon creatures or produce effects that function like creatures are not subject
        to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Divination:</b> These <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> do not affect creatures directly and are not subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>, even
        though what they reveal about a creature might be very damaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Enchantment:</b> Since enchantment <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> affect creatures’ minds, they are typically subject to spell
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Evocation:</b> If an evocation spell deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the creature, it has a direct effect. If the spell
        damages something else, it has an indirect effect.

        <b>Illusion: </b>These <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are almost never subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>. Illusions that entail a direct
        attack are exceptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Necromancy:</b> Most of these <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> alter the target creature’s life force and are subject to spell
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a>. Unusual necromancy <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that don’t affect other creatures directly are not subject to spell
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Transmutation:</b> These <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> if they transform the target creature.
        Transmutation <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are not subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> if they are targeted on a point in space instead of on
        a creature. Some transmutations make objects harmful (or more harmful), such as <i>magic stone</i>. Even these
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are not generally subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> because they affect the objects, not the creatures against
        which the objects are used. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> works against <i>magic stone </i>only if the creature with spell
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> is holding the stones when the <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> casts <i><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-19">magic stone</a> </i>on them.
      </p>

      <h4>Successful <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell Resistance</a></h4>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from affecting or harming the resistant creature, but
        it never removes a magical effect from another creature or negates a spell’s effect on another creature. Spell
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> prevents a spell from disrupting another spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Against an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed check against <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> allows the
        resistant creature to ignore any effect the spell might have. The magic continues to affect others normally.

      <h3 id="section-1-32"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-32">TREMORSENSE</a></h3>

      <p>
        A creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-32">tremorsense</a> automatically senses the location of anything that is in contact with the ground and
        within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to those that it’s sensing, then the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>
        defines the maximum distance of the shortest indirect path. It must itself be in contact with the ground, and
        the creatures must be moving.
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1">casting spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"> </a> with somatic <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>,
        they’re considered moving; they don’t have to move from place to place for a creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-32">tremorsense</a> to detect
        them.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-33"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-33">TURN RESISTANCE</a></h3>

      <p>Some creatures (usually undead) are less easily affected by the turning ability of clerics or paladins.</p>

      <p><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-33">Turn resistance</a> is an extraordinary ability.</p>

      <p>
        When resolving a turn, rebuke, <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a>, or bolster attempt, added the appropriate bonus to the creature’s Hit

      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">CONDITIONS</a></h2>

      <p>
        If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most
        severe effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ability Damaged:</b> The character has temporarily lost 1 or more ability score points. Lost points return at
        a rate of 1 per day unless noted otherwise by the condition dealing the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. A character with Strength 0
        falls to the ground and is helpless. A character with Dexterity 0 is paralyzed. A character with Constitution 0
        is dead. A character with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is unconscious. Ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is different from
        penalties to <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>, which go away when the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions </a> causing them go away.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ability Drained:</b> The character has permanently lost 1 or more ability score points. The character can
        regain these points only through magical means. A character with Strength 0 falls to the ground and is helpless.
        A character with Dexterity 0 is paralyzed. A character with Constitution 0 is dead. A character with
        Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is unconscious.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Blinded:</b> The character cannot see. He takes a –2 penalty to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, loses his Dexterity bonus to AC
        (if any), moves at half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, and takes a –4 penalty on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-12">Search </a> checks and on most Strength- and Dexterity-based
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>. All checks and activities that rely on <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35">vision</a> (such as reading and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> checks) automatically
        fail. All opponents are considered to have total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> (50% miss chance) to the blinded character.
        Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Blown Away:</b> Depending on its size, a creature can be blown away by winds of high velocity. A creature on
        the ground that is blown away is knocked down and rolls 1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> per
        10 feet. A flying creature that is blown away is blown back 2d6 × 10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> due to battering and buffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Checked:</b> Prevented from achieving forward motion by an applied force, such as wind. Checked creatures on
        the ground merely stop. Checked flying creatures move back a distance specified in the description of the
        effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Confused:</i></b><i> </i>A <i>confused </i>character’s actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn: 01–10,
        attack caster with melee or ranged <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> (or close with caster if attacking is not possible); 11–20, act
        normally; 21–50, do nothing but babble incoherently; 51–70, flee away from caster at top possible <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>; 71–100,
        attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject’s self ). A
        <i>confused </i>character who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.
        Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a <i>confused </i>character. Any
        <i>confused </i>character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is
        still <i>confused </i>when its turn comes. A <i>confused </i>character does not make <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>
        against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or
        because it has just been attacked).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Cowering: </b>The character is frozen in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> and can take no actions. A cowering character takes a –2
        penalty to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> and loses her Dexterity bonus (if any).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Dazed:</b> The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty
        to AC.
      </p>

      <p>A dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Dazzled:</b> The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature
        takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-12">Search</a> checks, and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Dead: </b>The character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> are reduced to –10, his Constitution drops to 0, or he is killed
        outright by a spell or effect. The character’s soul leaves his body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal
        or magical <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a>, but they can be restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically
        preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full health or to
        its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need
        not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> that affect dead bodies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Deafened:</b> A deafened character cannot hear. She takes a –4 penalty on <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative </a> checks, automatically
        fails <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks, and has a 20% chance of <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-5">spell failure</a> when <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1">casting spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> with verbal <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>.
        Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Disabled:</b> A character with 0 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, or one who has negative <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> but has become stable and
        conscious, is disabled. A disabled character may take a single move action or standard action each round (but
        not both, nor can she take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">full-round actions</a>). She moves at half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. Taking <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a> doesn’t risk
        further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a> such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> after the completion of the act. Unless
        the action increased the disabled character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, she is now in negative <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> and dying.
      </p>

      <p>
        A disabled character with negative <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> recovers <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> naturally if she is being helped. Otherwise,
        each day she has a 10% chance to start recovering <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points </a> naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, she
        loses 1 hit point. Once an unaided character starts recovering <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> naturally, she is no longer in danger
        of losing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (even if her current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> are negative).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Dying:</b> A dying character is unconscious and near death. She has –1 to –9 current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>. A dying
        character can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round (starting with the round in which the
        character dropped below 0 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>), the character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable. She has a 10%
        chance to become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a dying character reaches –10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>,
        she is dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Energy Drained:</b> The character gains one or more negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s, which might permanently drain the
        character’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s. If the subject has at least as many negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s as Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>, he dies. Each negative
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> gives a creature the following penalties: –1 penalty on attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>, ability
        checks; loss of 5 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>; and –1 to effective <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> (for determining the power, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, DC, and other
        details of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>). In addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the
        highest spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> castable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Entangled:</b> The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, but does not entirely prevent it
        unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature
        moves at half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, cannot <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> or <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, and takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls and a –4 penalty to
        Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration </a> check (DC 15 + the
        spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) or lose the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Exhausted:</b> An exhausted character moves at half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> and takes a –6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity.
        After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted
        by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Fascinated: </b>A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The creature stands or
        sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect
        lasts. It takes a –4 penalty on <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks </a> made as reactions, such as <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> checks. Any potential
        threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw </a> against the
        fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged
        weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated creature’s ally may shake it
        free of the spell as a standard action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Fatigued:</b> A fatigued character can neither <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> nor <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> and takes a –2 penalty to Strength and
        Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted.
        After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Flat-Footed:</b> A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, not yet reacting normally
        to the situation. A flat-footed character loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and cannot make attacks of
        opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Frightened:</b> A frightened creature flees from the source of its <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> as best it can. If unable to flee, it
        may fight. A frightened creature takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>, and
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-3">ability checks</a>. A frightened creature can use <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, including <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, to flee; indeed, the creature
        must use such means if they are the only way to escape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Grappling:</b> Engaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers. A
        grappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions. He does not threaten any squares, and loses
        his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) against opponents he isn’t grappling.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Helpless:</b> A helpless character is paralyzed, <i>held</i>, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise
        completely at an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a Dexterity of 0 (–5 modifier). Melee
        attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks gets
        no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy
        can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and
        scores a critical hit. (A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-3">rogue</a> also gets her sneak attack <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> bonus against a helpless foe when delivering a
        coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> dealt) or die.
      </p>

      <p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, nor do they need to make Fortitude saves
        to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Incorporeal: </b>Having no physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms.
        They can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, spell-like effects,
        or supernatural effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Invisible:</b> Visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted
        opponents, and ignores its opponents’ Dexterity bonuses to AC (if any). (<a href="spells-s.html#section-0-13">See Invisibility</a>, under Special
        Abilities.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Knocked Down:</b> Depending on their size, creatures can be knocked down by winds of high velocity. Creatures
        on the ground are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6 × 10 feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Nauseated:</b> Experiencing stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>,
        concentrate on <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a
        single move action per turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Panicked: </b>A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> from the source of its
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t take any other actions. In
        addition, the creature takes a –2 penalty on all <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>, and <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-3">ability checks</a>. If cornered, a
        panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action in combat. A panicked
        creature can use <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, including <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they
        are the only way to escape.
      </p>

      <p>Panicked is a more extreme state of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> than shaken or frightened.</p>

        <b>Paralyzed:</b> A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has
        effective Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions. A winged
        creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim</a>mer can’t <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim</a> and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature—ally or
        not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Petrified:</b> A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified
        character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is
        unharmed. If the character’s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise
        incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.
      </p>

      <p><b>Pinned:</b> Held immobile (but not helpless) in a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Prone:</b> The character is on the ground. An attacker who is prone has a –4 penalty on melee attack rolls
        and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A defender who is prone gains a +4 bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>
        against ranged attacks, but takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.
      </p>

      <p>Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Shaken: </b>A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>, and ability
        checks.
      </p>

      <p>Shaken is a less severe state of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> than frightened or panicked.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Sickened:</b> The character takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, skill
        checks, and <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-3">ability checks</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Stable:</b> A character who was dying but who has stopped losing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> and still has negative <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>
        is stable. The character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the character has become stable
        because of <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-4">aid</a> from another character (such as a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> check or magical <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a>), then the character no longer
        loses <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>. He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious and disabled (even though his <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>
        are still negative).
      </p>

      <p>
        If the character became stable on his own and hasn’t had help, he is still at risk of losing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>. Each
        hour, he has a 10% chance of becoming conscious and disabled. Otherwise he loses 1 hit point.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Staggered:</b> A character whose <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> exactly equals his current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points </a> is staggered. A
        staggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can she take
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">full-round actions</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        A character whose current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> exceed his <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> is no longer staggered; a character whose
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> exceeds his <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> becomes unconscious.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Stunned: </b>A stunned creature drops everything held, can’t take actions, takes a –2 penalty to AC, and
        loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Turned:</b> Affected by a turn undead attempt. Turned undead flee for 10 rounds (1 minute) by the best and
        fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Unconscious: </b>Knocked out and helpless. Unconsciousness can result from having current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> between
        –1 and –9, or from <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> in excess of current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>.
