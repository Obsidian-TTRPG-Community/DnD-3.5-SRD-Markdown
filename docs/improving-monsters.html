      <h1><a href="improving-monsters.html">IMPROVING MONSTERS</a></h1>

      <p>
        Each of the monster entries describes a typical creature of its kind. However, there are several methods by
        which extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by adding
        character classes, increasing a monster’s Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods are not
        mutually exclusive—it’s possible for a monster with a template to be improved by both increasing its Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>
        and adding character class levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Class Levels:</b> Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most commonly advance by adding
        class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s. Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of “By character class” in their Advancement
        line. When a monster adds a class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> usually represents an increase in experience and learned
        skills and capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Increased Hit Dice:</b> Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in shape, and nonintelligent monsters,
        can advance by increasing their Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>. Creatures with increased Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> are usually superior specimens of
        their race, bigger and more powerful than their <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>-of-the-mill fellows.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">Templates</a>:</b> Both intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an unusual heritage or an inflicted change
        in their essential nature may be modified with a template. <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">Templates</a> usually result in tougher monsters with
        capabilities that differ from those of their common kin.
      </p>

      <p>Each of these three methods for <a href="improving-monsters.html">improving monsters</a> is discussed in more detail below.</p>

      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-1">ABILITY SCORE ARRAYS</a></h2>

      <p>
        Monsters are assumed to have completely average (or standard) <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>—a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as
        modified by their racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are individuals and often have better than normal
        <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>, and usually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>. Monsters
        who improve by adding a template, and monsters who improve by increasing their Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>, may use any of the
        three arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be considered
        elite.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Elite Array: </b>The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. While the monster has one weakness compared to a
        typical member of its race, it is significantly better overall. The elite array is most appropriate for monsters
        who add levels in a player character class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Nonelite Array:</b> The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. The nonelite array does not necessarily make
        a monster better than normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with strengths and weaknesses
        compared to a typical member of its race. The nonelite array is most appropriate for monsters who add class
        levels in a NPC class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ability Score Improvement:</b> Treat monster Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> the same as character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> for determining ability
        score increases. This only applies to Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> increases, monsters do not gain ability score increases for
        levels they “already reached” with their racial Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>, since these adjustments are included in their basic
        <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-2">MONSTERS AND CLASS LEVELS</a></h2>

      <p>If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules for <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-6">multiclass characters</a><i>.</i></p>

      <p>
        The creature’s Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> equal the number of class levels it has plus its racial Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>. A creature’s “monster
        class” is always a <a href="races.html#section-0-1">favored class</a>, and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it. Additional Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>
        gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a creature’s size.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Humanoids and Class Levels:</b> Creatures with 1 or less HD replace their monster levels with their character
        levels. The monster loses the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> bonuses, skills, and <a href="feats.html">feats</a> granted by its 1 monster HD
        and gains the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, save bonuses, skills, <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, and other class abilities of a 1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> character of
        the appropriate class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a> Adjustment and Effective Character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a>:</b> To determine the effective character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> (ECL) of a
        monster character, add its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> adjustment to its racial Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> and character class levels. The monster is
        considered to have experience points equal to the minimum needed to be a character of its ECL.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> for purposes of determining how
        much <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> it can purchase. Generally, only monsters with an Advancement entry of “By character class”
        receive NPC gear; other creatures adding character levels should be treated as monsters of the appropriate CR
        and assigned <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a>, not <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases:</b> A monster’s total Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>, not its ECL, govern its
        acquisition of <a href="feats.html">feats</a> and ability score increases.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-3"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-3">INCREASING HIT DICE</a></h2>

      <p>
        As its Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> increase, a creature’s attack bonuses and <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> modifiers might improve. It gains more
        <a href="feats.html">feats</a> and skills, depending on its type, as shown on Table: Creature Improvement by Type.
      </p>

      <p>Note that if a creature acquires a character class, it improves according to its class, not its type.</p>

        A creature may become larger when its Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> are increased (the new size is noted parenthetically in the
        monster’s Advancement entry).
      </p>

      <p>
        A size increase affects any special ability the creature has that is affected by size. Increased size also
        affects a creature’s <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>, AC, attack bonuses, and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> values as indicated on the tables below.

      <h2 id="section-4"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">TEMPLATES</a></h2>

      <p>
        Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a
        freak of nature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from
        parents of different species.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-1"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4-1">ACQUIRED AND INHERITED TEMPLATES</a><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4"></a></h3>

      <p>
        Some <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> can be added to creatures anytime. <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">Templates</a> such as these are referred to as acquired <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a>,
        indicating that the creature did not always have the attributes of the template.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a>, known as inherited <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a>, are part of a creature from the beginning of its existence.
        Creatures are born with these <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a>.
      </p>

      <p>It’s possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type.</p>

      <h3 id="section-4-2"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4-2">READING A TEMPLATE</a></h3>

      <p>
        A template’s description provides a set of instructions for altering an existing creature, known as the base
        creature. The changes that a template might cause to each line of a creature ’s <a href="monsters-intro-a.html#section-1-1">statistics block</a> are discussed
        below. Generally, if a template does not cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is missing from the
        template description. For clarity, the entry for a statistic or attribute that is not changed is sometimes given
        as “Same as the base creature.”
      </p>

      <p><b>Size and Type:</b> <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">Templates</a> often change a creature’s type, and may change the creature’s size.</p>

      <p>
        If a template changes the base creature’s type, the creature also acquires the augmented subtype unless the
        template description indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original
        type. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the new creature has the traits of the new type but the features of
        the original type.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a template changes a creature’s size, use Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to calculate changes to
        natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, attack rolls, and <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Hit Dice and Hit Points:</b> Most <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> do not change the number of Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> a monster has, but some do.
        Some <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> change the size of a creature’s Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> (usually by changing the creature type). A few <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a>
        change previously acquired Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>, and continue to change Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> gained with class levels, but most
        <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> that change Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> change only the creature’s original HD and leave class Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> unchanged.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> entry in a template description is missing, Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> do not change unless the
        creature’s Constitution modifier changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">Initiative</a>: </b>If a template changes the monster’s Dexterity, or if it adds or removes the Improved
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">Initiative</a> feat, this entry changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">Speed</a>:</b> If a template modifies a creature’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, the template states how that happens. More commonly, a
        template adds a new <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>:</b> If a template changes the creature’s size, see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to
        determine its new <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> and to see whether its natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> changes. In some cases the method of
        determining <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> changes radically; the template description explains how to adjust the creature’s AC.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Base Attack/Grapple:</b> <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">Templates</a> usually do not change a creature’s base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>. If a template
        modifies a creature’s base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, the template description states how that happens. Changes to a
        creature’s Strength score can change a creature’s <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> bonus, as can changes to its size.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Attack and Full Attack:</b> Most <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> do not change a creature’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> or modes of attack, even
        when the creature’s type changes (the creature’s base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> is the same as a creature of the original
        type). Of course, any change in <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> may affect <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>es. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use
        the new modifier to determine <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>es. A change in a monster’s size also changes its <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>; see
        Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a>:</b> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a> changes with Strength. If the creature uses a two-handed weapon or has a single natural
        weapon, it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. If it has more than a single attack then it adds
        its Strength bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls for the primary attack and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all secondary attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Space/Reach:</b> A template may change this entry if it changes the monster’s size. Note that this table does
        not take into account special situations such as exceptional reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">Special Attacks</a>:</b> A template may add or remove <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a>. The template description gives the details
        of any <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a> a template provides, including how to determine <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> DCs, if applicable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special Qualities:</b> A template may add or remove special qualities. The template description gives the
        details of any special qualities a template provides, including how to determine <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> DCs, if
        applicable. Even if the special qualities entry is missing from a template description, the creature still gains
        any qualities associated with its new type.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Base Saves:</b> As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not always change its base <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw </a>
        bonuses. You only need to adjust them for new modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom. A template may,
        however, state that a monster has a different “good” <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Abilities:</b> If a template changes one or more <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>, these changes are noted here.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Skills: </b>As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not always change its skill points. Most
        <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> don’t change the number of Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> a creature has, so you don’t need to adjust skills in that case
        unless the key abilities for those skills have changed, or the template gives a bonus on one or more skills, or
        unless the template gives a feat that provides a bonus on a skill check.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> change how skill points are determined, but this change usually only affects skill points gained
        after the template is applied. Treat skills listed in the base creature’s description as class skills, as well
        as any new skills provided by the template.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Feats:</b> Since most <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> do not change the number of Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> a creature has, a template will not
        change the number of <a href="feats.html">feats</a> the creature has. Some <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> grant one or more bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Environment:</b> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>

      <p><b>Organization:</b> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Challenge Rating:</b> Most <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> increase the creature’s Challenge Rating. A template might provide a
        modifier to be added to the base creature’s CR, or it might specify a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of modifiers depending on the base
        creature’s original Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> or CR.
      </p>

      <p><b><a href="treasure.html">Treasure</a>: </b>Usually the same as the base creature.</p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">Alignment</a>:</b> Usually the same as the base creature, unless the template is associated with a certain
        <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Advancement:</b> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a> Adjustment:</b> This entry is a modifier to the base creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> adjustment. Any <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> adjustment
        is meaningless unless the creature retains a high enough Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain class levels after
        applying the template.
      </p>

      <p>Adding More Than One Template</p>

      <p>
        In theory, there’s no limit to the number of <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> you can add to a creature. To add more than one template,
        just apply each template one at a time. Always apply inherited <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> before applying acquired <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a>.
        Whenever you add multiple <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a>, pay attention to the creature’s type—you may add a template that makes the
        creature ineligible for other <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-4">templates</a> you might want to add.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-5"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5">ADVANCED MONSTER CHALLENGE RATING</a></h2>

      <p>
        When <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-1">adding class levels</a> to a creature with 1 or less HD, you advance the creature like a character. Otherwise,
        use the following guidelines.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-1"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-1">ADDING CLASS LEVELS</a></h3>

      <p>
        If you are advancing a monster by adding player character class levels, decide if the class levels directly
        improve the monster’s existing capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        When <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-1">adding class levels</a> to a creature, you should give it typical <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> appropriate for that class.
        Most creatures are built using the standard array of <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10, adjusted by racial
        modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use the elite array of <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> before racial adjustments:
        15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with <a href="npc-classes.html">NPC classes</a> use the nonelite array of 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. T
      </p>

      <p>Associated Class Levels</p>

      <p>
        Class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s that increase a monster’s existing strengths are known as associated class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s. Each associated
        class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> a monster has increases its CR by 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-1">Barbarian</a>, <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-5">fighter</a>, <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-1">paladin</a>, and <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a> are associated classes for a creature that relies on its fighting
        ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-3">Rogue</a> and <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a> are associated classes for a creature that relies on stealth to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> its foes, or on skill
        use to give itself an advantage.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature that already has the ability to cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> as a
        character of the class in question, since the monster’s levels in the spellcasting class stack with its innate
        spellcasting ability.
      </p>

      <p>Nonassociated Class Levels</p>

      <p>
        If you add a class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> that doesn’t directly play to a creature’s strength the class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is considered
        nonassociated, and things get a little more complicated<i>. </i>Adding a nonassociated class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> to a monster
        increases its CR by 1/2 per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> until one of its nonassociated class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s equals its original Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>. At
        that point, each additional <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the same class or a similar one is considered associated and increases the
        monster’s CR by 1.
      </p>

      <p>Levels in <a href="npc-classes.html">NPC classes</a> are always treated as nonassociated.</p>

      <h3 id="section-5-2"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-2">ADDING HIT DICE</a><a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1"></a></h3>

      <p>
        When you improve a monster by <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-2">adding Hit Dice</a><a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1"></a>, use Table: Improved Monster CR Increase to determine the effect
        on the creature’s CR. Keep in mind that many monsters that advance by <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-2">adding Hit Dice</a><a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1"></a> also increase in size. Do
        not stack this CR increase with any increase from class levels. In general, once you’ve doubled a creature’s CR,
        you should closely watch any additional increases in its abilities. <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-2">Adding Hit Dice</a><a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1"></a> to a creature improves
        several of its abilities, and radical increases might not follow this progression indefinitely. Compare the
        monster’s improved <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw </a> bonuses, and any DCs of its <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a> from the HD increase
        to typical characters of the appropriate <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> and adjust the CR accordingly.

      <h3 id="section-5-3"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-3">INCREASING SIZE</a></h3>

      <p>
        Generally, increasing a monster’s <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-3-1">size increases</a> its combat effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased
        Strength, reach, and other benefits. Apply this modifier if you increase a creature beyond Medium and in
        conjunction with any other increases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size may actually lose effectiveness because of a size
        increase. Monsters that don’t benefit from <a href="improving-monsters.html#section-3-1">size increases</a> don’t advance in that manner for this reason.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-4"><a href="improving-monsters.html#section-5-4">ADDING SPECIAL ABILITIES</a><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1"></a></h3>

      <p>
        You can add any sort of spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary ability to a creature. As with a class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>,
        you should determine how much, or how little, this ability adds to the creature’s existing repertoire. A suite
        of abilities that work together should be treated as a single modifier for this purpose. If the ability (or
        combination of abilities) significantly increases the monster’s combat effectiveness, increase its CR by 2.
        Minor abilities increase the creature’s CR by 1, and truly trivial abilities may not increase CR at all. If the
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a> a monster gains are not tied to a class or Hit Die increase, this CR increase stacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance of incapacitating or crippling a character in one
        round. A significant special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster’s vulnerability to common
        attacks. Do not add this factor twice if a monster has both <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a> and special qualities.
      </p>

      <p>Make sure to “scale” your evaluation of these abilities by the monster’s current CR.</p>
