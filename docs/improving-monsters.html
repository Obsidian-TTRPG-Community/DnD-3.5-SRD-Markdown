      <h1>IMPROVING MONSTERS</h1>

      <p>
        Each of the monster entries describes a typical creature of its kind. However, there are several methods by
        which extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by adding
        character classes, increasing a monster’s Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods are not
        mutually exclusive—it’s possible for a monster with a template to be improved by both increasing its Hit Dice
        and adding character class levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Class Levels:</b> Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most commonly advance by adding
        class levels. Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of “By character class” in their Advancement
        line. When a monster adds a class level, that level usually represents an increase in experience and learned
        skills and capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Increased Hit Dice:</b> Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in shape, and nonintelligent monsters,
        can advance by increasing their Hit Dice. Creatures with increased Hit Dice are usually superior specimens of
        their race, bigger and more powerful than their run-of-the-mill fellows.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Templates:</b> Both intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an unusual heritage or an inflicted change
        in their essential nature may be modified with a template. Templates usually result in tougher monsters with
        capabilities that differ from those of their common kin.
      </p>

      <p>Each of these three methods for improving monsters is discussed in more detail below.</p>

      <h2>ABILITY SCORE ARRAYS</h2>

      <p>
        Monsters are assumed to have completely average (or standard) ability scores—a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as
        modified by their racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are individuals and often have better than normal
        ability scores, and usually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of ability scores. Monsters
        who improve by adding a template, and monsters who improve by increasing their Hit Dice, may use any of the
        three arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be considered
        elite.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Elite Array: </b>The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. While the monster has one weakness compared to a
        typical member of its race, it is significantly better overall. The elite array is most appropriate for monsters
        who add levels in a player character class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Nonelite Array:</b> The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. The nonelite array does not necessarily make
        a monster better than normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with strengths and weaknesses
        compared to a typical member of its race. The nonelite array is most appropriate for monsters who add class
        levels in a NPC class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ability Score Improvement:</b> Treat monster Hit Dice the same as character level for determining ability
        score increases. This only applies to Hit Dice increases, monsters do not gain ability score increases for
        levels they “already reached” with their racial Hit Dice, since these adjustments are included in their basic
        ability scores.
      </p>

      <h2>MONSTERS AND CLASS LEVELS</h2>

      <p>If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules for multiclass characters<i>.</i></p>

      <p>
        The creature’s Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it has plus its racial Hit Dice. A creature’s “monster
        class” is always a favored class, and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it. Additional Hit Dice
        gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a creature’s size.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Humanoids and Class Levels:</b> Creatures with 1 or less HD replace their monster levels with their character
        levels. The monster loses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted by its 1 monster HD
        and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills, feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level character of
        the appropriate class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level:</b> To determine the effective character level (ECL) of a
        monster character, add its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels. The monster is
        considered to have experience points equal to the minimum needed to be a character of its ECL.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its character level for purposes of determining how
        much equipment it can purchase. Generally, only monsters with an Advancement entry of “By character class”
        receive NPC gear; other creatures adding character levels should be treated as monsters of the appropriate CR
        and assigned treasure, not equipment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases:</b> A monster’s total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its
        acquisition of feats and ability score increases.
      </p>

      <h2>INCREASING HIT DICE</h2>

      <p>
        As its Hit Dice increase, a creature’s attack bonuses and saving throw modifiers might improve. It gains more
        feats and skills, depending on its type, as shown on Table: Creature Improvement by Type.
      </p>

      <p>Note that if a creature acquires a character class, it improves according to its class, not its type.</p>

        A size increase affects any special ability the creature has that is affected by size. Increased size also
        affects a creature’s ability scores, AC, attack bonuses, and damage values as indicated on the tables below.

      <h2>TEMPLATES</h2>

      <p>
        Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a
        freak of nature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from
        parents of different species.
      </p>

      <h3>ACQUIRED AND INHERITED TEMPLATES</h3>

      <p>
        Some templates can be added to creatures anytime. Templates such as these are referred to as acquired templates,
        indicating that the creature did not always have the attributes of the template.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other templates, known as inherited templates, are part of a creature from the beginning of its existence.
        Creatures are born with these templates.
      </p>

      <p>It’s possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type.</p>

      <h3>READING A TEMPLATE</h3>

      <p>
        A template’s description provides a set of instructions for altering an existing creature, known as the base
        creature. The changes that a template might cause to each line of a creature ’s statistics block are discussed
        below. Generally, if a template does not cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is missing from the
        template description. For clarity, the entry for a statistic or attribute that is not changed is sometimes given
        as “Same as the base creature.”
      </p>

      <p><b>Size and Type:</b> Templates often change a creature’s type, and may change the creature’s size.</p>

      <p>
        If a template changes the base creature’s type, the creature also acquires the augmented subtype unless the
        template description indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original
        type. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the new creature has the traits of the new type but the features of
        the original type.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a template changes a creature’s size, use Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to calculate changes to
        natural armor, Armor Class, attack rolls, and grapple bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Hit Dice and Hit Points:</b> Most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a monster has, but some do.
        Some templates change the size of a creature’s Hit Dice (usually by changing the creature type). A few templates
        change previously acquired Hit Dice, and continue to change Hit Dice gained with class levels, but most
        templates that change Hit Dice change only the creature’s original HD and leave class Hit Dice unchanged.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the Hit Dice entry in a template description is missing, Hit Dice and hit points do not change unless the
        creature’s Constitution modifier changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Initiative: </b>If a template changes the monster’s Dexterity, or if it adds or removes the Improved
        Initiative feat, this entry changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Speed:</b> If a template modifies a creature’s speed, the template states how that happens. More commonly, a
        template adds a new movement mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Armor Class:</b> If a template changes the creature’s size, see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to
        determine its new Armor Class and to see whether its natural armor changes. In some cases the method of
        determining Armor Class changes radically; the template description explains how to adjust the creature’s AC.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Base Attack/Grapple:</b> Templates usually do not change a creature’s base attack bonus. If a template
        modifies a creature’s base attack bonus, the template description states how that happens. Changes to a
        creature’s Strength score can change a creature’s grapple bonus, as can changes to its size.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Attack and Full Attack:</b> Most templates do not change a creature’s attack bonus or modes of attack, even
        when the creature’s type changes (the creature’s base attack bonus is the same as a creature of the original
        type). Of course, any change in ability scores may affect attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use
        the new modifier to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster’s size also changes its attack bonus; see
        Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Damage:</b> Damage changes with Strength. If the creature uses a two-handed weapon or has a single natural
        weapon, it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to the damage. If it has more than a single attack then it adds
        its Strength bonus to damage rolls for the primary attack and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all secondary attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Space/Reach:</b> A template may change this entry if it changes the monster’s size. Note that this table does
        not take into account special situations such as exceptional reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special Attacks:</b> A template may add or remove special attacks. The template description gives the details
        of any special attacks a template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if applicable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special Qualities:</b> A template may add or remove special qualities. The template description gives the
        details of any special qualities a template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if
        applicable. Even if the special qualities entry is missing from a template description, the creature still gains
        any qualities associated with its new type.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Base Saves:</b> As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not always change its base saving throw
        bonuses. You only need to adjust them for new modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom. A template may,
        however, state that a monster has a different “good” saving throw.
      </p>

      <p><b>Abilities:</b> If a template changes one or more ability scores, these changes are noted here.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Skills: </b>As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not always change its skill points. Most
        templates don’t change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, so you don’t need to adjust skills in that case
        unless the key abilities for those skills have changed, or the template gives a bonus on one or more skills, or
        unless the template gives a feat that provides a bonus on a skill check.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some templates change how skill points are determined, but this change usually only affects skill points gained
        after the template is applied. Treat skills listed in the base creature’s description as class skills, as well
        as any new skills provided by the template.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Feats:</b> Since most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, a template will not
        change the number of feats the creature has. Some templates grant one or more bonus feats.
      </p>

      <p><b>Environment:</b> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>

      <p><b>Organization:</b> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Challenge Rating:</b> Most templates increase the creature’s Challenge Rating. A template might provide a
        modifier to be added to the base creature’s CR, or it might specify a range of modifiers depending on the base
        creature’s original Hit Dice or CR.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treasure: </b>Usually the same as the base creature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Alignment:</b> Usually the same as the base creature, unless the template is associated with a certain
        alignment.
      </p>

      <p><b>Advancement:</b> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Level Adjustment:</b> This entry is a modifier to the base creature’s level adjustment. Any level adjustment
        is meaningless unless the creature retains a high enough Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain class levels after
        applying the template.
      </p>

      <p>Adding More Than One Template</p>

      <p>
        In theory, there’s no limit to the number of templates you can add to a creature. To add more than one template,
        just apply each template one at a time. Always apply inherited templates before applying acquired templates.
        Whenever you add multiple templates, pay attention to the creature’s type—you may add a template that makes the
        creature ineligible for other templates you might want to add.
      </p>

      <h2>ADVANCED MONSTER CHALLENGE RATING</h2>

      <p>
        When adding class levels to a creature with 1 or less HD, you advance the creature like a character. Otherwise,
        use the following guidelines.
      </p>

      <h3>ADDING CLASS LEVELS</h3>

      <p>
        If you are advancing a monster by adding player character class levels, decide if the class levels directly
        improve the monster’s existing capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it typical ability scores appropriate for that class.
        Most creatures are built using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10, adjusted by racial
        modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use the elite array of ability scores before racial adjustments:
        15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with NPC classes use the nonelite array of 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. T
      </p>

      <p>Associated Class Levels</p>

      <p>
        Class levels that increase a monster’s existing strengths are known as associated class levels. Each associated
        class level a monster has increases its CR by 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on its fighting
        ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on stealth to surprise its foes, or on skill
        use to give itself an advantage.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature that already has the ability to cast spells as a
        character of the class in question, since the monster’s levels in the spellcasting class stack with its innate
        spellcasting ability.
      </p>

      <p>Nonassociated Class Levels</p>

      <p>
        If you add a class level that doesn’t directly play to a creature’s strength the class level is considered
        nonassociated, and things get a little more complicated<i>. </i>Adding a nonassociated class level to a monster
        increases its CR by 1/2 per level until one of its nonassociated class levels equals its original Hit Dice. At
        that point, each additional level of the same class or a similar one is considered associated and increases the
        monster’s CR by 1.
      </p>

      <p>Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.</p>

      <h3>ADDING HIT DICE</h3>

      <p>
        When you improve a monster by adding Hit Dice, use Table: Improved Monster CR Increase to determine the effect
        on the creature’s CR. Keep in mind that many monsters that advance by adding Hit Dice also increase in size. Do
        not stack this CR increase with any increase from class levels. In general, once you’ve doubled a creature’s CR,
        you should closely watch any additional increases in its abilities. Adding Hit Dice to a creature improves
        several of its abilities, and radical increases might not follow this progression indefinitely. Compare the
        monster’s improved attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and any DCs of its special abilities from the HD increase
        to typical characters of the appropriate level and adjust the CR accordingly.

      <h3>INCREASING SIZE</h3>

      <p>
        Generally, increasing a monster’s size increases its combat effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased
        Strength, reach, and other benefits. Apply this modifier if you increase a creature beyond Medium and in
        conjunction with any other increases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size may actually lose effectiveness because of a size
        increase. Monsters that don’t benefit from size increases don’t advance in that manner for this reason.
      </p>

      <h3>ADDING SPECIAL ABILITIES</h3>

      <p>
        You can add any sort of spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary ability to a creature. As with a class level,
        you should determine how much, or how little, this ability adds to the creature’s existing repertoire. A suite
        of abilities that work together should be treated as a single modifier for this purpose. If the ability (or
        combination of abilities) significantly increases the monster’s combat effectiveness, increase its CR by 2.
        Minor abilities increase the creature’s CR by 1, and truly trivial abilities may not increase CR at all. If the
        special abilities a monster gains are not tied to a class or Hit Die increase, this CR increase stacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance of incapacitating or crippling a character in one
        round. A significant special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster’s vulnerability to common
        attacks. Do not add this factor twice if a monster has both special attacks and special qualities.
      </p>

      <p>Make sure to “scale” your evaluation of these abilities by the monster’s current CR.</p>
