        Armor Class against attacks by traps.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> If you spend 3 additional power points, this power also gives you the uncanny dodge ability; if
        you spend 6 additional power points, this power gives you the improved uncanny dodge ability as well.
      </p>

      <h3>Darkvision, Psionic</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 3, psychic warrior 2</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> Psion/wilder 5, psychic warrior 3</p>

      <p>As the <i>darkvision </i>spell, except as noted here.</p>

      <h3>Daze, Psionic</h3>

      <p>Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Material and mental</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One humanoid creature that has 4 HD or less</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>As the <i>daze </i>spell, except as noted here.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power can affect a target that has Hit Dice
        equal to 4 + the additional points.
      </p>

      <h3>Death Urge</h3>

      <p>Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 4</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Mental</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One living creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 7</p>

      <p>
        You plant a hidden death-urge impulse in the subject’s unconscious. On the subject’s next turn, it looks for the
        quickest method to end its life and attempts to do so. The subject takes no other action on its turn except
        attempting to harm itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        If armed, the subject attacks itself as a full-round action. The attack automatically succeeds and deals damage
        as a critical hit. If unarmed, the subject moves adjacent to the nearest enemy and provokes an attack of
        opportunity, offering its opponent an opening, which the opponent may or may not choose to take advantage of.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the subject is unarmed and no enemy is nearby, the subject simply does nothing at all. A subject close to an
        immediate and lethal hazard such as a cliff or a fire might hurl itself off the cliff or into the fire instead
        of striking itself with a weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC increases by 2 and its
        duration increases by 1 round.
      </p>

      <h3>Deceleration</h3>

      <p>Psychoportation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory and material</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One Medium or smaller creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        You warp space around an individual, hindering the subject’s ability to move. The subject’s speed (in any
        movement mode it possesses) is halved. A subsequent manifestation of <i>deceleration </i>on the subject does not
        further decrease its speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect a target one size category
        larger.
      </p>

      <h3>Decerebrate</h3>

      <p>Psychoportation [Teleportation]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 7</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Mental</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One living creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 13</p>

      <p>
        With <i>decerebrate, </i>you selectively remove a portion of the subject’s brain stem. The creature loses all
        cerebral function, vision, hearing, and other sensory abilities, and all voluntary motor activity. The subject
        becomes limp and unresponsive. Without extreme measures, such as <i>greater restoration </i>or some other
        suitable effect of 7th level or higher, the creature perishes in 1d4 days.
      </p>

      <h3>Déjà Vu</h3>

      <p>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Mental</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        Your mental impulse forces the subject to repeat the actions it took on its previous turn. If the situation has
        changed in such a way that the subject can’t take the same actions again (if its foe is dead, or the subject has
        run out of power points, and so on), the subject stands still and takes no actions for 1 round. In any event,
        the subject can still defend itself, and it retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even if it stands still.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC increases by 1.</p>

      <h3>Demoralize</h3>

      <p>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Mental and olfactory</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 30 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 30-ft.-radius spread centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        You fill your enemies with self-doubt. Any enemy in the area that fails its save becomes shaken for the duration
        of the power. Allies and creatures without an Intelligence score are unaffected.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s range and the radius of its area
        both increase by 5 feet, and the power’s save DC increases by 1.
      </p>

      <h3>Destiny Dissonance</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Seer 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Material and mental</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> Creature touched</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        Your mere touch grants your foe an imperfect, unfocused glimpse of the many possible futures in store.
        Unaccustomed to and unable to process the information, the subject becomes sickened for 1 round per level of the
        manifester.
      </p>

      <h3>Detect Hostile Intent</h3>

      <p>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 2, psychic warrior 2</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Olfactory</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 30 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 10 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 3</p>

      <p>
        While the duration of this power lasts, you become aware of the presence of any creatures with hostile intent
        within 30 feet of you, and their direction from you (but not their specific location). The power detects active
        aggression, as opposed to vigilance. In addition, while this power is active you cannot be surprised or caught
        flatfooted by creatures that are susceptible to mind-affecting powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        While under the effect of this power, you can make Sense Motive checks as a free action against anyone within 30
        feet of you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The power can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of stone, 3 inches of common metal, 1 inch of lead, or 6 feet of
        wood or dirt blocks it.
      </p>

      <h3>Detect Psionics</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory and visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 60 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> Cone -shaped emanation centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        You detect psionic auras. A psionic aura is given off by any active or permanent power, or during the use of any
        psionic feat. Characters who have levels in a psionic class, creatures with the psionic subtype, and creatures
        with the Wild Talent feat possess psionic auras. The amount of information revealed by the manifestation of this
        power depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
      </p>

      <p><i>1st Round: </i>Presence or absence of psionic auras.</p>

      <p><i>2nd Round: </i>Number of different psionic auras and the strength of the most potent aura.</p>

      <p>
        <i>3rd Round: </i>The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in
        line of sight, you can make Psicraft checks to determine the discipline involved in each aura. (Make one check
        per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 + one-half manifester level for an effect that is not created by a power,
        such as that of a psionic item.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Psionically charged locations, multiple disciplines, or strong local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal
        weaker auras.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Aura Strength: </i>A psionic aura’s strength depends on a functioning power’s level or an item’s manifester
        level. If an aura falls into more than one category, <i>detect psionics </i>indicates the stronger of the two.
        Detection of an overwhelming aura (see the accompanying table) dazes you for 1 round and the power ends.

        <i>Lingering Aura: </i>A psionic aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a power) or
        is destroyed (in the case of a psionic item). If <i>detect psionics </i>is manifested and directed at such a
        location, the power indicates an aura of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this
        dim level depends on its original strength:

      <p>
        Each round, you can turn to detect psionics in a new area. You can tell the difference between magical and
        psionic auras. The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of
        lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
      </p>

      <h3>Detect Remote Viewing</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 4</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Mental and visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 40 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 24 hours</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 7</p>

      <p>
        You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a clairsentience (scrying) power or
        divination (scrying) spell. The power’s effect radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of
        every psionic or magical sensor within the power’s area.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the viewing attempt originates within the area, you also know the viewer’s location. Otherwise, you and the
        remote viewer immediately make opposed manifester level checks (1d20 + manifester level, or viewer’s caster
        level as appropriate). If you at least match the remote viewer’s result, you get a visual image of the remote
        viewer and an accurate sense of the remote viewer’s direction and distance from you.
      </p>

      <h3>Detect Teleportation</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Nomad 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 40 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        You sense the use of any effects of the teleportation subdiscipline within the area. You sense the use of these
        powers whether or not you have line of sight or line of effect (although a force effect prevents this
        detection). When you sense the use of an appropriate power, you know the direction in which the power was used,
        though not the distance or the exact effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> If you spend 2 additional power points, this power’s range increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10
        ft./level).

        of sight. You can bring along possessions that amount to as much as a medium load, including living creatures
        that weigh as much as 20 pounds. Movement caused by the use of <i>dimension slide </i>does not provoke attacks
        of opportunity.

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 20 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> Cone-shaped emanation centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        You broadcast a mental compulsion that convinces one or more creatures of 4 Hit Dice or less that they are
        disabled (see page 307 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among
        creatures with equal Hit Dice, those who are closest to the power’s point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice
        that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Creatures that are rendered helpless or are destroyed
        when they reach 0 hit points cannot be affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creatures affected by this power believe that they have somehow been brought to the brink of unconsciousness and
        must act accordingly. While it’s possible for an important nonplayer character to attempt some sort of “heroic”
        action, common NPCs and creatures under the effect of this power typically cower or retreat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any creature that attempts to take a standard action immediately breaks the compulsion and can act normally. A
        creature that attempts to heal itself or that receives healing is likewise freed of the compulsion, and if it is
        not actually wounded, the healing is wasted. A creature that takes damage is also instantly freed of the
        compulsion (although the damage still counts against its actual current hit points).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s range increases by 5 feet and its
        save DC increases by 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, for every additional power point you spend to increase the range and the save DC, this power can
        affect targets that have Hit Dice equal to 4 + the number of additional points.
      </p>

      <h3>Disintegrate, Psionic</h3>

      <p>Psychoportation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 6</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory, material, and visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> Ray</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial (object)</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 11</p>

      <p>
        A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any
        creature struck by the ray takes 22d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this
        power is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature’s equipment
        is unaffected.
      </p>

      <p>
        When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus,
        the power disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects
        constructed entirely of force, but not psionic effects such as a <i>null psionics field</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of
        damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per
        manifestation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, the damage this power deals to a subject that fails
        its saving throw increases by 2d6 points. Augmenting this power does not change the amount of damage the target
        takes if it succeeds on its saving throw.

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>
        You dismiss creatures, objects, or effects composed of ectoplasm, such as astral constructs or the
        <i>ectoplasmic cocoon </i>power, or that were formerly composed of ectoplasm, such as items created by
        metacreativity (creation) powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        An ectoplasmic creature that fails its Will saving throw dissipates into so much constituent ectoplasm, which
        evaporates immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature under the effect of the <i>ectoplasmic form </i>power that fails its saving throw is either destroyed
        out right or physically shifted to a random location on the Astral Plane (50% chance for either result).
      </p>

      <p>
        Other ongoing powers that create ectoplasmic objects or effects, such as <i>ectoplasmic cocoon, </i>are
        dismissed if you succeed on a manifester level check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +10) against a DC of
        11 + the power’s manifester level.

      <h3>Dispel Psionics</h3>

      <p>Psychokinesis</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 3</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Target or Area:</b> One manifester, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous or 1d4 rounds; see text</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>
        You can use <i>dispel psionics </i>to end ongoing powers that have been manifested on a creature or object, to
        temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item, or to end ongoing powers (or at least their
        effects) within an area. A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some powers, as detailed in
        their descriptions, can’t be defeated by <i>dispel psionics, </i>or can be ended only if you manifest
        <i>dispel psionics </i>at a high enough manifester level. <i>Dispel psionics </i>can end spell-like effects just
        as it does powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already
        over before the <i>dispel psionics </i>can take effect.
      </p>

      <p>You choose to use <i>dispel psionics </i>in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Targeted Dispel: </i>One object, creature, or power is the target of the <i>dispel psionics </i>power. You
        make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +10) against the power or against each ongoing power
        currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the power’s manifester
        level. If you succeed on a particular check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power or is under the effect of an ongoing
        power, you make a dispel check to end the power or its effect. If the object that you target is a psionic item,
        you make a dispel check against the item’s manifester level. If you succeed, all the item’s psionic properties
        are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic
        for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface&nbsp; is temporarily closed. A psionic item’s
        physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact).
        Artifacts and deities are unaffected by
      </p>

      <p>mortal power such as this.</p>

      <p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifested yourself.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Area Dispel: </i>When <i>dispel psionics </i>is used in this way, the power affects everything within a
        20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more powers, you make a dispel
        check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against
        progressively weaker powers until you dispel one power (which discharges the <i>dispel psionics </i>power so far
        as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s psionic items are not affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each object within the area that is the target of one or more powers, you make dispel checks as with
        creatures. Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the
        <i>dispel psionics </i>power, you can make a dispel check to dispel the power.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel psionics </i>power, you can make a dispel check
        to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power is in the area, you can make a dispel check to
        end the power that created that object or construct in addition to attempting to dispel powers targeting the
        creature or object. You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have
        manifested.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, the bonus on your dispel check increases by 2 (to a
        maximum bonus of +20 for a 5-point expenditure).
      </p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless, object)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 11</p>

      <p>
        You create a psychokinetic shield around the subject that improves the chance that any powers affecting the
        subject will resist a <i>dispel psionics </i>power (or a <i>dispel magic </i>spell) or a negation effect that
        targets a specific power (such as <i>shatter mind blank</i>). When <i>dispelling buffer </i>is manifested on a
        creature or object, add +5 to the DC of the dispel check for each ongoing effect that is subject to being
        dispelled.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Dispel psionics </i>can negate <i>dispelling buffer</i>, but against a targeted dispel,
        <i>dispelling buffer </i>is always checked last (with the same +5 bonus). Against an area dispel,
        <i>dispelling buffer </i>is checked in the order according to its level (with the same +5 bonus).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> When a psychic warrior manifests this power, the range is personal and the target is the
        manifester.

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        Your mere touch can disperse the surface material of a foe or object, sending a tiny portion of it far away.
        This effect is disruptive; thus, your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by 1d6 points.</p>

        Your touch, claw, or bite is corrosive, and sizzling moisture visibly oozes from your natural weapon or hand.
        You deal 4d6 points of acid damage to any creature or object you touch with your successful melee touch attack.
        Acid you secrete denatures 1 round after use, losing all efficacy and ability to deal damage. You are immune to
        your own acid.

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes (foils diversion)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 13</p>

      <p>
        Similar to <i>detect teleportation</i>, except that you know the intended destination, and you can divert the
        final destination of any teleportation attempt made by others within the area. This is an immediate action, like
        manifesting a quickened power, and counts toward the limit of one quickened power per round. You can manifest
        this power even if it is not your turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can divert the destination of both incoming and outgoing teleportations, psionic and magical. You must
        overcome the power resistance of creatures that possess it to make a successful diversion, and the teleporting
        creature can make a Will save to foil the diversion as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the purpose of this power, “divert” means you choose the actual destination of any teleportation attempt you
        can affect, as if you yourself were teleporting to that location, regardless of the teleportation range of the
        effect you are diverting. The destination you choose must be a location with which you are very familiar or that
        you have studied carefully.

      <h3>Dream Travel</h3>

      <p>Psychoportation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Nomad 7</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> You and touched creature or creatures (up to one/level)</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 13</p>

      <p>
        You and any creature you touch are drawn along a crystal arc of reverie to the edge of conscious thought and
        into the region of dreams. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but
        each one must be touching another one. You physically enter the land of dreams, leaving nothing behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the region of dreams, you move through a menagerie of thoughts, desires, and phantoms created by the minds of
        dreamers everywhere. For every minute you move through dream, you can “wake” to find yourself five miles
        displaced in the waking world. Thus, a character can use this power to travel rapidly by physically entering
        where only dreams normally prowl, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back into the waking world. You
        know where you will come out in the waking world.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Dream travel </i>can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this
        requires crossing into the dreams of outsiders, where you are subject to the vagaries of many dream realities—a
        potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to another plane of existence in this fashion requires 1d4 hours
        of uninterrupted travel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any creatures that come along when <i>dream travel </i>is manifested also make the transition to the borders of
        unconscious thought. A creature separated from you wanders off into the dreamscape. When the duration ends, all
        affected creatures return to the waking world as much as 1,000 miles (d%x10) from their starting point. If a
        creature remains in the dreamscape, it is powerless to leave unless it can manifest the
        <i>dream travel </i>power itself or someone who manifests the power seeks out the lost creature.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC increases by 1.</p>

      <p>
        If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as
        <i>claws of the beast</i>), you can use this power to improve that weapon. One of your claws becomes
        two-dimensional, making it razorsharp. The weapon is now psionically keen, increasing its threat range from 20
        to 19–20. This benefit does not stack with other effects that improve a weapon’s threat range.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third spatial component of your hand still exists but is temporarily shunted into the Ethereal Plane, so
        against ethereal or incorporeal targets this power is ineffective.

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        This power reinforces an astral construct created by the <i>astral construct </i>power, giving you a +1 bonus on
        any manifester level checks you make to protect it against <i>dispel psionics </i>or a similar effect, and a +1
        bonus on its saving throw to resist <i>dismiss ectoplasm. </i>This power can be manifested as a swift action in
        the same round that you manifest an astral construct, as long as the power points you spend to perform both
        actions does not exceed your manifester level.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, your bonus on manifester level checks to protect
        your astral construct increases by 1, and your astral construct’s bonus on its saving throw to resist
        <i>dismiss ectoplasm </i>increases by 1.

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>
        You draw writhing strands of ectoplasm from the Astral Plane that wrap up the subject like a mummy. The subject
        can still breathe but is otherwise helpless, unable to see outside the cocoon, speak, or take any physical
        actions. The subject’s nostrils are clear (air passes through the cocoon normally). The subject can execute
        purely mental actions (such as manifesting powers or casting spells with no verbal, somatic, or material
        components).
      </p>

      <p>
        Cutting or damaging the cocoon can free a victim. The cocoon has hardness 8 and 20 hit points. Teleportation and
        other forms of travel provide a means of escape, but the cocoon extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking
        ethereal travel. An <i>ectoplasmic cocoon </i>can’t be affected by <i>dispel psionics</i>, but it can be
        dismissed with <i>dismiss ectoplasm, </i>or otherwise destroyed by extreme measures or items.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creature within the cocoon is visible only as a vague shape (substantial enough to interrupt line of sight)
        and cannot be directly harmed or interacted with unless the cocoon is destroyed. The cocooned creature can be
        moved normally (the weight of the cocoon is negligible).
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature that is cocooned while aloft begins to fall immediately, and a creature that is cocooned while
        swimming or underwater may drown.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>

      <p>1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC increases by 1.</p>

      <p>2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect a target one size category larger.</p>

      <p>
        As <i>ectoplasmic cocoon</i>, except you can cocoon several creatures (or a single big creature that fits in a
        20-footradius sphere or hemisphere) in a mass of writhing ectoplasm. Targets entirely within the area who fail
        their save are caught and cocooned. If a creature’s body is only partially within the area, this power does not
        affect that creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, the radius of this power’s area increases by 5

      <h3>Ectoplasmic Form</h3>

      <p>
        You and all your gear become a partially translucent mass of rippling ectoplasm that generally conforms to your
        normal shape. You gain damage reduction 10/psionics, and you gain immunity to poison and critical hits. Your
        material armor (including <i>inertial armor</i>) becomes meaningless, although your size, Dexterity, deflection
        bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects (such as those gained by <i>inertial armor</i>) still apply to
        your Armor Class.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can manifest powers while in <i>ectoplasmic form</i>, but you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + power
        level) for each power you attempt to manifest.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot physically attack, you lose supernatural abilities (if any), and you can’t speak while in
        <i>ectoplasmic form</i>. You can’t run, but you can fly at a speed of 20 feet (perfect). You can pass through
        small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all you were wearing or holding in your hands. You are
        subject to the effects of wind, and you can’t enter water or other liquid. You also can’t manipulate objects or
        activate items, even those carried along with you. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases
        their effects may be moot (such as items that provide armor or natural armor bonuses).

      <h3>Ectoplasmic Shambler</h3>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> One ectoplasmic manifestation of a size equal to ten 10-ft. cubes (S)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 9</p>

      <p>
        You fashion an ephemeral, manylegged mass of pseudo-living ectoplasm called an ectoplasmic shambler. You can
        direct the shambler as a free action. It has a speed of 10 feet. It can completely surround objects (and
        opponents) over which it is manifested or onto which it moves, because it has the consistency of thick mist. The
        vision of those within the shambler is limited to 5 feet, and manifesting powers (or casting spells) within the
        shambler is difficult due to the constant turbulence felt by those caught in the shambler’s form.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creatures enveloped by the shambler, regardless of Armor Class, take 1 point of damage for every two manifester
        levels you have in each round they become or remain within the roiling turbulence of the shambler. Anyone trying
        to manifest a power must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + power’s or spell’s level) to successfully manifest
        a power or cast a spell inside the shambler.
      </p>

      <p>
        A wind stronger than 20 miles per hour that blows against the shambler reduces its speed to 0 feet during the
        first round, and in subsequent rounds moves it in the direction of the wind at a speed of 5 feet. A wind
        stronger than 20 miles per hour that blows in the direction the shambler travels increases its speed to 15 feet.

      <p>
        Your rapid mental lashings assault the ego of your enemy, debilitating its confidence. The target takes 1d4
        points of Charisma damage, or half that amount (minimum 1 point) on a successful save. A target that fails its
        save is also dazed for 1 round.
      </p>

      <p>
        You gain low-light vision (as an elf ) for the duration of the power, as well as a +2 bonus on Search and Spot
        checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, you gain the ability to notice secret or concealed doors by merely passing within 5 feet of one,
        getting to make a Search check as if you were actively looking for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        If <i>elfsight </i>is used in conjunction with <i>my light</i>, the cone of light extends out to 40 feet instead

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> Psion/wilder 7, psychic warrior 5</p>

      <p>
        You empathically share your pain and suffering with your attacker. Each time a creature strikes you in melee, it
        takes damage equal to the amount it dealt to you or 5 points, whichever is less. This damage is empathic in
        nature, so powers and abilities the attacker may have such as damage reduction and regeneration do not lessen or
        change this damage. The damage from <i>empathic feedback </i>has no type, so even if you took fire damage from a
        creature that has immunity to fire, <i>empathic feedback </i>will damage your attacker.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage potential increases by 1 point.

      <p>
        You heal another creature’s wounds, transferring some of its damage to yourself. When you manifest this power,
        you can heal as much as 2d10 points of damage. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the dice
        result, and you lose hit points equal to half of that amount. (This loss can bring you to 0 or fewer hit
        points.) Powers and abilities you may have such as damage reduction and regeneration do not lessen or change
        this damage, since you are taking the target’s pain into yourself in an empathic manner. The damage transferred
        by this power has no type, so even if you have immunity to the type of damage the target originally took, the
        transfer occurs normally and deals hit point damage to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, you can use this power to absorb one poison or one disease afflicting the target creature into
        yourself. When you absorb a poison or disease, you do not take any of the damage previously dealt to the target
        by the affliction, but you do assume the burden of making the secondary and/or continuing Fortitude saves to
        combat the affliction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, you can use this power to transfer up to 1 point of ability damage per manifester level from the target
        to yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, you can heal an additional 2d10 points of damage (to
        a maximum of 10d10 points per manifestation).

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>
        You transfer your hurt to another. When you manifest this power and then make a successful touch attack, you can
        transfer 50 points of damage (or less, if you choose) from yourself to the touched creature. You immediately
        regain hit points equal to the amount of damage you transfer.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot use this power to gain hit points in excess of your full normal total. The transferred damage is
        empathic in nature, so powers and abilities the subject may have such as damage reduction and regeneration do
        not lessen or change this damage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The damage transferred by this power has no type, so even if the subject has immunity to the type of damage you
        originally took, the transfer occurs normally and deals hit point damage to the subject.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>

      <p>
        1. For every additional power point you spend, you can transfer an additional 10 points of damage (maximum 90
        points per manifestation).
      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
        When you absorb damage, you can choose to radiate visible light that illuminates a 60-foot radius for a number
        of rounds equal to the points of damage you successfully resisted, or merely dissipate the energy without giving
        off a visual display.

      <p>
        As <i>energy adaptation</i>, except that instead of radiating away energy as light, you store up the energy and
        can later discharge it as a ray. To discharge a ray requires a standard action. You can choose to fire any
        number of rays during the power’s duration. The ray you fire must be of one of the energy types you have stored
        (if you have stored more than one type, you can choose what kind of energy to use for each ray). If a ray
        successfully strikes its target (requiring a ranged touch attack), the target takes damage equal to the amount
        of energy damage of that type you have stored, up to a maximum of three times your manifester level. As long as
        this power remains in effect, you can continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays using the stored
        damage.

      <p><b>Target:</b> Any two creatures no more than 15 ft. apart</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 round/level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half or Fortitude half; see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 9</p>

      <p>
        Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Your body’s psionically fueled
        bioenergetic currents produce an arc of energy of the chosen type that targets a creature you designate as the
        primary foe for 9d6 points of damage in every round when the power remains in effect. Energy also arcs off the
        primary foe to strike one additional foe that is initially within 15 feet of the primary foe, or that
        subsequently moves within 15 feet of the primary foe while the duration lasts. Secondary foes take half the
        damage that the primary foe takes in every round while the duration lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Should either the primary or secondary foe fall to less than 0 hit points (or should a target completely evade
        the effect with a special ability or power), the <i>energy current </i>’s arc randomly retargets another primary
        and/or secondary foe while the duration lasts. Targeted foes can move normally, possibly moving out of range of
        the effect, but each round they are targeted and remain in range they must make a saving throw to avoid taking
        full damage in that round.
      </p>

      <p>
        Concentrating to maintain <i>energy current </i>is a full-round action. If you take damage while maintaining
        <i>energy current</i>, you must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid losing
        your concentration on the power.

        dice of damage, this power’s save DC increases by 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional secondary target. Any

        of the chosen type at a target, dealing it 2d6 points of damage. In addition, if a subject of up to one size
        category larger than you fails a Strength check (DC equal to the save DC of this power), the driving force of
        the energy blast pushes it back 5 feet plus another 5 feet for every 5 points of damage it takes. If a wall or
        other solid object prevents the subject from being pushed back, the subject instead slams into the object and

        abilities). An “ectoburst” discharges from the field, targeting the source of the attack and dealing 4d6 points
        of damage of the chosen energy type. To be affected, a target must be within close range, you must have line of
        sight and line of effect to it, and you must be able to identify the source of the attack. The ectoburst is a
        ranged touch attack made using your base attack bonus plus your key ability modifier for your manifesting class.

        You throw off a faux ectoplasmic shell, allowing you to slide out of range of a damaging effect. When you
        manifest this power in conjunction with making a successful Reflex save against an attack that normally deals
        half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly come
        within range of a dangerous effect. Manifesting this power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened
        power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You can even manifest this power
        when it isn’t your turn.

      <h3>Expansion</h3>

      <p>Psychometabolism</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psychic warrior 1</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        This power causes instant growth, doubling your height, length, and width and multiplying your weight by 8. This
        increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Strength, a –2 size
        penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum effective Dexterity score of 1), a –1 size penalty on attack rolls, and a –1
        size penalty to Armor Class due to your increased size.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your new size is Large or larger, you have a space of at least 10 feet and a natural reach of at least 10
        feet. This power doesn’t change your speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain
        the maximum possible size and can make a Strength check (using your increased Strength score) to burst any
        enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you—you
        cannot crush yourself to death by increasing your size.
      </p>

      <p>
        All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly expanded by this power. Melee and projectile weapons deal more
        damage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves your
        possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that
        thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired
        them). Multiple effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a
        second manifestation of this power to further expand yourself.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.</p>

      <p>
        1. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power increases your size by two size categories instead of one.
        You gain a +4 size bonus to Strength, a –4 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum effective Dexterity score of
        1), a –2 size penalty on attack rolls, and a –2 size penalty to Armor Class due to your increased size.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action instead of a standard
        action.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power’s duration is 1 minute per level rather than 1 round per
        level.

      <p>
        You have a limited ability to falsify one of the subject’s senses. The subject thinks she sees, hears, smells,
        tastes, or feels something other than what her senses actually report. You can’t create a sensation where none
        exists, nor make the subject completely oblivious to a sensation, but you can replace the specifics of one
        sensation with different specifics. For instance, you could make a human look like a dwarf (or one human look
        like another specific human), a closed door look like it is open, a vat of acid smell like rose water, a parrot
        look like a bookend, stale rations taste like fresh fruit, a light pat feel like a dagger thrust, a scream sound
        like the howling wind, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can switch between senses you falsify round by round. You can’t alter the size of an object by more than 50%
        by using this power. Thus, you couldn’t make a castle look like a hovel, but you could make it look like a
        different castle, or a rough hillock of approximately the same size. If this power is used to distract an enemy
        manifester who is attempting to use his powers, the enemy must make a Concentration check as if being grappling
        or pinned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because you override a victim’s senses, you can fool a victim who is using <i>true seeing </i>or some other
        method of gathering information, assuming you know that the victim is actively using such an effect and you can
        maintain concentration.
      </p>

        <b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any

        You temporarily link the fates of any two creatures, if both fail their saving throws. If either linked creature
        experiences pain, both feel it. When one loses hit points, the other loses the same amount. If one takes
        nonlethal damage, so does the other. If one creature is subjected to an effect to which it is immune (such as a
        type of energy damage), the linked creature is not subjected to it either. If one dies, the other must
        immediately succeed on a Fortitude save against this power’s save DC or gain two negative levels.
      </p>

      <p>No other effects are transferred by the <i>fate link.</i></p>

        Your limited omniscience allows you to reroll a saving throw, attack roll, or skill check. Whatever the result
        of the reroll, you must use it even if it is worse than the original roll.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting this
        power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one
        quickened power per round. If you use the power to reroll a saving throw, you can manifest this power even when
        it is not your turn.

      <p>
        You can use another’s psionic or metapsionic feats for yourself. You make a melee touch attack against a target.
        If successful, you immediately are familiar with the target’s psionic and metapsionic feats, if any, and you can
        choose a number of these feats to “leech” equal to your Wisdom modi- fier (minimum one).
      </p>

      <p>
        While the power lasts, you are treated as if you possessed the stolen feats, despite the fact that you have more
        feats than normally allowed. During this same period, the target can make no use of the stolen feats. When the
        power’s duration expires, you lose access to the feats, and the target gains immediate use of them. This
        transfer occurs regardless of the distance between you and the target.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the duration of <i>feat leech </i>is extended by the use of a metapsionic feat, the target gains a Will
        saving throw every 10 minutes beyond the normal duration. If this save succeeds, the power’s duration ends. If
        the target is killed before the duration expires, you immediately lose the benefit of the stolen feats.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot steal a feat for which you do not meet the prerequisites, if any. However, you can use a stolen feat
        as the prerequisite for another stolen feat.

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 9</p>

      <p>
        You use your mastery of energy to cheat death. If you are within 30 feet of an open flame, you can use this
        power. Any damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points or lower instead has a chance to discorporate you. You
        attempt a Will save (DC 5 + damage dealt); if it succeeds, you simply break apart into dozens of flitting
        tongues of flame and vanish, along with all your gear and anything you are holding or carrying.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day later, you reappear adjacent to an open flame nearest to the place where you discorporated, seeming to
        materialize from the fire (you choose where you appear along the perimeter of that open flame). While
        discorporated, you do not exist—you can do nothing, nor can any of your enemies do anything to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 3 additional power points you spend, you gain a +1 bonus on your Will save to
        determine whether you discorporate.

      <h3>Fission</h3>

      <p>Psychometabolism</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Egoist 7</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Olfactory</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> Duplicate of yourself</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 13</p>

      <p>
        You can divide yourself, creating a duplicate that comes into existence 5 feet away. Your duplicate thinks and
        acts exactly as you do and follows your orders, although it will not do anything you wouldn’t do yourself. Your
        duplicate has all your abilities but none of your psionic or magical equipment (it does possess a duplicate of
        all your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well as mundane versions of any psionic or
        magical equipment you have). You and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining usages of
        pertinent special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when
        this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with two negative levels for the purpose of
        determining the powers to which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative
        levels cannot be removed by any means). Your duplicate has all other physical traits you had at the time you
        manifest this power. Powers, spells, or other effects affecting you when you manifest this power do not transfer
        to your duplicate.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from
        each other you are. You gain back any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining, you
        take half of the damage your duplicate has taken since this power was manifested. This damage could potentially
        leave you with negative hit points, but it can’t reduce your hit points to less than –9.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain one negative level. If you
        die, your duplicate remains in existence, and is for all intents you, but with two negative levels. (Once the
        duration expires, one of the negative levels immediately converts to one lost level; the other negative level
        can be removed by standard means.)
      </p>

      <p>
        You can have only one <i>fissioned </i>duplicate in existence at one time; your duplicate cannot use this power.
        You cannot use <i>fusion </i>or <i>metaconcert </i>with a duplicate, or share any other power or effect that
        pools abilities (the sum of you and you is still just you). Similarly, attempting to use powers such as
        <i>claws of the vampire </i>or <i>vampiric blade </i>to hurt your duplicate only damages your duplicate; these
        powers do not heal you. <i>Empathic transfer </i>and similar powers are likewise ineffective (transferring
        wounds to yourself isn’t a good healing strategy).
      </p>

      <p>
        All powers affecting a <i>fissioned </i>creature, either the original or the duplicate, end when the
        <i>fission </i>ends. All damage, including hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, and ability burn
        damage, is added together.

        shield bonus to Armor Class (which applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since the <i>force screen </i>is a
        force effect). Since it hovers in front of you, the effect has no armor check penalty associated with it.

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 11</p>

      <p>
        You wrench from your subconscious a terrifying visage of deadly hunger and become one with it. You are
        transformed into a nightmarish version of yourself, complete with an ooze-sleek skin coating, lashing tentacles,
        and a fright-inducing countenance. You effectively gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks, though you retain your
        basic shape and can continue to use your equipment. This power cannot be used to impersonate someone; while
        horrible, your form is recognizably your own.
      </p>

      <p>
        You gain the frightful presence extraordinary ability, which takes effect automatically when you charge a foe.
        Opponents within 30 feet of you that have fewer Hit Dice or levels than you and that witness your charge become
        shaken for 5d6 rounds if they fail a Will save (DC 16 + your Cha modifier). An opponent that succeeds on the
        saving throw is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear
        effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your horrific form grants you a natural armor bonus of +5, damage reduction 5/–, and a +4 bonus to your Strength
        score. In addition, you gain +10 feet to your land speed as well as a +10 bonus on Climb and Jump checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        A nest of violently flailing black tentacles sprout from your hair and back. You can make up to four additional
        attacks with these tentacles in addition to your regular melee attacks in each round that you take a full attack
        action. You can make tentacle attacks within the space you normally threaten. If you make your tentacle attacks
        in addition to you regular melee attacks, each tentacle attacks at your highest base attack bonus with a –5
        penalty. If you forgo all your other attacks, making only tentacle attacks, you make your tentacle attacks at
        your highest base attack bonus with no penalty. These tentacles deal 2d8 points of damage plus one-half your
        Strength bonus on each successful strike.
      </p>

      <p>
        This power functions only while you inhabit your base form (for instance, you can’t be metamorphed or
        polymorphed into another form, though you can use <i>breath of the black dragon, claws of the beast</i>, and
        <i>bite of the wolf </i>in conjunction with this power for your regular attacks), and while your mind resides
        within your own body.

      <p>
        You cause the touched subject’s flesh to ripple, grow together, and fuse into a nearly seamless whole. The
        subject is forced into a fetal position (if humanoid), with only the vaguest outline of its folded arms and legs
        visible below the all-encompassing wave of flesh. The subject retains the ability to breathe, eat, and excrete,
        but may lose the use of its senses (see below). If the sudden transformation would prove fatal to the creature
        (such as fusing a swimming airbreathing subject, or a flying subject), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.
        Unless it loses the use of its senses (see below), the creature can still perform purely mental actions, such as
        manifesting powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the target fails its Fortitude save to avoid the power’s effect, the subject must immediately attempt a
        second Fortitude save. If this second save is failed, the creature’s eyes and ears fuse over, effectively
        blinding and deafening it. Moreover, it loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, as well
        as its ability to manifest powers (if any), and is generally in sorry shape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incorporeal or gaseous creatures and creatures not composed of flesh are immune to <i>fuse flesh</i>, and a
        shapechanger can revert to its unfused form as a standard action.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC increases by 1.</p>

      <h3>Fusion</h3>

      <p>Psychometabolism</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Egoist 8</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory, material, and visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> You and one touched willing creature of your type and your size or smaller</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 15, XP</p>

      <p>
        You and another willing, corporeal, living creature of the same or smaller size fuse into one being. As the
        manifester, you control the actions of the fused being. However, you can give up this control to the other
        creature. Once you give up control, you cannot regain it unless the other creature relinquishes it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fused being has your current hit points plus the other creature’s current hit points. The fused being knows
        all the powers you and the other creature know, has the sum of your and the other creature’s power points, and
        knows or has prepared any spells you or the other creature possesses (if any). Likewise, all feats, racial
        abilities, and class features are pooled (if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being gains it only
        once). For each of the six ability scores, the fused being’s score is the higher of yours and the other
        creature’s, and the fused being also has the higher Hit Dice or manifester level—this effectively means the
        fused being uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and skill modifiers of either member, and it manifests
        powers at the higher of the manifester levels that you or the other creature possessed before becoming fused.
      </p>

      <p>
        You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being and what equipment remains available for use. These
        fused items are restored once the power ends.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the power ends, the fused being separates. The other creature appears in an area adjacent to you that you
        determine. If separation occurs in a cramped space, the other creature is expelled through the Astral Plane,
        finally coming to rest materially in the nearest empty space and taking 1d6 points of damage for each 10 feet of
        solid material passed through.
      </p>

      <p>
        Damage taken by the fused being is split evenly between you and the other creature when the power ends. You do
        not leave the <i>fusion </i>with more hit points than you entered it with, unless you were damaged prior to the
        <i>fusion </i>and the fused being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the fused being’s remaining power
        points are split between you and the other creature (you can leave with more points than you entered with, as
        long as you don’t exceed the maximum power points for your level and ability score). Ability damage and negative
        levels are also split between you and the other creature. (If an odd number of negative levels or ability score
        reductions must be split, you decide whether you or the other creature receives the additional loss.)
      </p>

      <p>
        If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent creatures, both ofwhich are also dead. You cannot
        use <i>fission </i>on a fused being.
