      <h1><a href="magic-overview.html">MAGIC OVERVIEW</a></h1>

      <p>
        A spell is a one-time magical effect. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> come in two types: arcane (cast by bards, sorcerers, and wizards)
        and divine (cast by clerics, druids, and experienced paladins and rangers). Some spellcasters select their
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> from a limited list of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most spellcasters prepare their <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> in advance—whether from a spellbook or through devout prayers and
        meditation— while some cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> spontaneously without preparation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite these different ways that characters use to learn or prepare their <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, when it comes to casting
        them, the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are very much alike.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cutting across the categories of arcane and <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> are the eight schools of magic. These schools
        represent the different ways that <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> take effect.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-1">CASTING SPELLS</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a></h2>

      <p>
        Whether a spell is arcane or divine, and whether a character prepares <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> in advance or chooses them on the
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a>, casting a spell works the same way.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-1"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-1">CHOOSING A SPELL</a></h3>

      <p>
        First you must choose which spell to cast. If you’re a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a>, <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-4">druid</a>, experienced <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-1">paladin</a>, experienced <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a>,
        or <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>, you select from among <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> prepared earlier in the day and not yet cast (see Preparing <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">Wizard</a>
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> and <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4-1">Preparing Divine Spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> or <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a>, you can select any spell you know, provided you are capable of <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1">casting spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> of
        that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher.
      </p>

      <p>
        To cast a spell, you must be able to speak (if the spell has a verbal component), gesture (if it has a somatic
        component), and manipulate the material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> or focus (if any). Additionally, you must concentrate to cast
        a spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a spell has multiple versions, you choose which version to use when you cast it. You don’t have to prepare
        (or learn, in the case of a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> or <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a>) a specific version of the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you’ve cast a prepared spell, you can’t cast it again until you prepare it again. (If you’ve prepared
        multiple copies of a single spell, you can cast each copy once.) If you’re a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> or <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a>, casting a spell
        counts against your daily limit for <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> of that spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, but you can cast the same spell again if you
        haven’t reached your limit.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-2"><a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">CONCENTRATION</a></h3>

      <p>
        To cast a spell, you must concentrate. If something interrupts your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration </a> while you’re casting, you must
        make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check or lose the spell. The more distracting the interruption and the higher the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of
        the spell you are trying to cast, the higher the DC is. If you fail the check, you lose the spell just as if you
        had cast it to no effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Injury:</b> If while trying to cast a spell you take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, you must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 10 +
        points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> taken + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting). If you fail the check, you lose the spell
        without effect. The interrupting event strikes during spellcasting if it comes between when you start and when
        you complete a spell (for a spell with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in response to
        your casting the spell (such as an attack of opportunity provoked by the spell or a contingent attack, such as a
        readied action).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are taking continuous <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> half the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is considered to take place while you are casting a spell.
        You must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 10 + 1/2 the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> that the continuous source last dealt + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of
        the spell you’re casting). If the last <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt was the last <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> that the effect could deal then the
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> is over, and it does not <a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-27">distract</a> you.
      </p>

      <p>Repeated <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> does not count as continuous <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell: </b>If you are affected by a spell while attempting to cast a spell of your own, you must make a
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check or lose the spell you are casting. If the spell affecting you deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, the DC is 10 +
        points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the spell interferes with you or distracts you in some other way, the DC is the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> DC + the
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting. For a spell with no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>, it’s the DC that the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>
        would have if a save were allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Grappling or Pinned:</b> The only <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> you can cast while grappling or pinned are those without somatic
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> and whose material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> (if any) you have in hand. Even so, you must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check
        (DC 20 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Vigorous Motion:</b> If you are riding on a moving <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>, taking a bouncy <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">ride</a> in a wagon, on a small boat in
        rough water, below-decks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 10 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Violent Motion: </b>If you are on a galloping <a href="monsters-animals.html#section-21">horse</a>, taking a very rough <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">ride</a> in a wagon, on a small boat in
        rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you
        must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting) or lose the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Violent <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">Weather</a>: </b>You must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check if you try to cast a spell in violent <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">weather</a>. If
        you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting. If
        you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting. In either
        case, you lose the spell if you fail the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check. If the <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">weather</a> is caused by a spell, use the rules
        in the Spell subsection above.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Casting Defensively:</b> If you want to cast a spell without provoking any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>, you must
        make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell you’re casting) to succeed. You lose the spell if you
        fail.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Entangled:</b> If you want to cast a spell while entangled in a net or by a tanglefoot bag or while you’re
        affected by a spell with similar effects, you must make a DC 15 <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check to cast the spell. You lose
        the spell if you fail.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-3"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-3">COUNTERSPELLS</a></h3>

      <p>
        It is possible to cast any spell as a counterspell. By doing so, you are using the spell’s <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> to disrupt the
        casting of the same spell by another character. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other
        arcane.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>How Counterspells Work: </b>To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the target of the
        counterspell. You do this by choosing the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> action. In doing so, you elect to wait to complete your action
        until your opponent tries to cast a spell. (You may still move your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, since <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> is a standard action.)
      </p>

      <p>
        If the target of your counterspell tries to cast a spell, make a <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> check (DC 15 + the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>).
        This check is a free action. If the check succeeds, you correctly <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> the opponent’s spell and can attempt
        to counter it. If the check fails, you can’t do either of these things.
      </p>

      <p>
        To complete the action, you must then cast the correct spell. As a general rule, a spell can only counter
        itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you have it prepared (if you prepare <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>), you cast it,
        altering it slightly to create a counterspell effect. If the target is within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, both <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> automatically
        negate each other with no other results.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Counterspelling Metamagic <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a>:</b> <a href="feats.html#section-2-3">Metamagic feats</a> are not taken into account when determining whether a
        spell can be countered
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Specific Exceptions:</b> Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> specifically counter each other, especially when they have diametrically
        opposed effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">Dispel Magic</a> </i></b><b>as a Counterspell:</b> You can use <i>dispel magic </i>to counterspell another
        spellcaster, and you don’t need to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> the spell he or she is casting. However, <i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">dispel magic</a> </i>doesn’t
        always work as a counterspell (see the spell description).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-4"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">CASTER LEVEL</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a></h3>

      <p>
        A spell’s power often depends on its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>, which for most spellcasting characters is equal to your class
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in the class you’re using to cast the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can cast a spell at a lower <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> than normal, but the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> you choose must be high enough
        for you to cast the spell in question, and all <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>-dependent features must be based on the same <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the event that a class feature, domain granted power, or other special ability provides an adjustment to your
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>, that adjustment applies not only to effects based on <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> (such as <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, and
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt) but also to your <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> check to overcome your target’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> and to the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-5"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-5">SPELL FAILURE</a></h3>

      <p>
        If you ever try to cast a spell in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> where the characteristics of the spell cannot be made to conform,
        the casting fails and the spell is wasted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> also fail if your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> is broken and might fail if you’re wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor </a> while casting a spell
        with somatic <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-6"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-6">THE SPELL’S RESULT</a></h3>

      <p>
        Once you know which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those creatures have made
        successful <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> (if any were allowed), you can apply whatever results a spell entails.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-7"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-7">SPECIAL SPELL EFFECTS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Many <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-7">special spell effects</a> are handled according to the school of the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> in question Certain other special
        spell features are found across spell schools.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Attacks:</b> Some <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2">spell descriptions</a> refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even those that don’t
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> opponents are considered attacks. Attempts to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-12">turn or rebuke undead</a> count as attacks. All <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that
        opponents resist with <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, that deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, or that otherwise <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> or hamper subjects are attacks.
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that summon monsters or other allies are not attacks because the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> themselves don’t <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Types:</b> Usually, a bonus has a type that indicates how the spell grants the bonus. The important
        aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a>
        bonuses, most circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see Combining Magical
        Effects, below). The same principle applies to penalties—a character taking two or more penalties of the same
        type applies only the worst one.
      </p>

      <p><b>Bringing Back the Dead:</b> Several <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have the power to restore slain characters to life.</p>

      <p>
        When a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, travels through the Astral
        Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature did not worship a
        deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. Bringing someone back from the dead means
        retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-21">Level Loss</a>: </i>Any creature brought back to life usually loses one <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of experience. The character’s new
        XP total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> and the minimum needed for the
        next one. If the character was 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of Constitution instead
        of losing a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-21">level loss</a> or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> </i>or
        <i><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-37">miracle</a>. </i>A revived character can regain a lost <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived
        character who was 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> at the time of death can regain lost points of Constitution by improving his or her
        Constitution score when he or she attains a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> that allows an ability score increase.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Preventing Revivification: </i>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be
        returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-47">raise dead</a> </i>or <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-73">resurrection</a> </i>to
        restore the slain character to life. Casting <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-19">trap the soul </a> </i>prevents any sort of revivification unless the
        soul is first released.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Revivification against One’s Will: </i>A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish </a> to be. A soul
        knows the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a>, <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to
        return on that basis.

      <h3 id="section-1-8"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-8">COMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> or magical effects usually work as described, no matter how many other <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells </a> or magical effects happen
        to be operating in the same area or on the same recipient. Except in special cases, a spell does not affect the
        way another spell operates. Whenever a spell has a specific effect on other <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, the spell description
        explains that effect. Several other general rules apply when <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or magical effects operate in the same
        place:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Stacking Effects:</b> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>,
        and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don’t
        stack even if they come from different <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> (or from effects other than <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>; see Bonus Types, above).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Different Bonus Names: </i>The bonuses or penalties from two different <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> stack if the modifiers are of
        different types. A bonus that isn’t named stacks with any bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths: </i>In cases when two or more identical <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are
        operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one applies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Same Effect with Differing Results: </i>The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to
        the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the series trumps the others. None of the previous
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the
        series lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </i>Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell irrelevant. Both
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are still active, but one has rendered the other useless in some fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Multiple Mental Control Effects: </i>Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control render each
        other irrelevant, such as a spell that removes the subjects ability to act. Mental controls that don’t remove
        the recipient’s ability to act usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental
        control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the
        control each effect allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing
        controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> with Opposite Effects:</b> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties,
        or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells </a> negate or counter each other. This is a special
        effect that is noted in a spell’s description.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Instantaneous Effects:</b> Two or more <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect
        the same target.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2">SPELL DESCRIPTIONS</a></h2>

      <p>
        The description of each spell is presented in a standard format. Each category of information is explained and
        defined below.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-1"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">NAME</a></h3>

      <p>The first line of every spell description gives the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a> by which the spell is generally known.</p>

      <h3 id="section-2-2"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-2">SCHOOL (SUBSCHOOL)</a></h3>

      <p>
        Beneath the spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a> is a line giving the school of magic (and the subschool, if appropriate) that the spell
        belongs to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Almost every spell belongs to one of eight schools of magic. A school of magic is a group of related <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that
        work in similar ways. A small number of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> (<i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-24">arcane mark</a>, <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-68">limited wish</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54"></a>, <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-3">permanency</a>, <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-26">prestidigitation</a>, </i>and <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a></i>) are universal, belonging to no school.
      </p>

      <h4>Abjuration</h4>

      <p>
        Abjurations are protective <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical
        abilities, <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence.
      </p>

      <p>
        If one abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more, the magical fields interfere
        with each other and create barely visible <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> fluctuations. The DC to find such <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> with the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-12">Search</a> skill
        drops by 4.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used to
        push away those creatures. If you force the barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible pressure
        against the barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.
      </p>

      <h4>Conjuration</h4>

      <p>
        Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools. Conjurations bring manifestations of objects,
        creatures, or some form of <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> to you (the summoning subschool), actually <a href="equipment.html#section-4-7">transport</a> creatures from another
        plane of existence to your plane (calling), <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">heal</a> (<a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a>), <a href="equipment.html#section-4-7">transport</a> creatures or objects over great distances
        (teleportation), or create objects or effects on the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a> (creation). Creatures you conjure usually, but not
        always, obey your commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a conjuration spell cannot appear
        inside another creature or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open
        location on a surface capable of supporting it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creature or object must appear within the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, but it does not have to remain within the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Calling:</b> A calling spell transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The spell
        grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the spell may limit the
        circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do
        not disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> of a calling spell
        is instantaneous, which means that the called creature can’t be dispelled.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Creation: </b>A creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place the
        spellcaster designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the spell has a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> other than
        instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object
        vanishes without a trace. If the spell has an instantaneous <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, the created object or creature is merely
        assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on magic for its existence.
      </p>

      <p><b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">Healing</a>: </b>Certain divine conjurations <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">heal</a> creatures or even bring them back to life.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Summoning:</b> A summoning spell instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the
        spell ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from, but a summoned
        object is not sent back unless the spell description specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes
        away if it is killed or if its <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> drop to 0 or lower. It is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the
        creature to reform, during which time it can’t be summoned again.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> it has cast expire. A
        summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have, and it refuses to cast any <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that
        would cost it XP, or to use any spell-like abilities that would cost XP if they were <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Teleportation:</b> A teleportation spell transports one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The
        most powerful of these <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, the transportation is
        (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teleportation is instantaneous travel through <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks
        teleportation.
      </p>

      <h4><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-48">Divination</a></h4>

      <p>
        <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-48">Divination</a> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to find hidden things, and
        to foil deceptive <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-48">divination</a> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in the direction you look. The
        cone defines the area that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple rounds, you can
        often gain additional information, as noted in the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> for the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Scrying:</b> A <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-6">scrying</a> spell creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted
        otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of acuity includes any
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or effects that target you, but not <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is
        treated as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus it functions normally even if you have been
        blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence
        check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell.
      </p>

      <p>Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks a <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-6">scrying</a> spell, and you sense that the spell is so blocked.</p>

      <h4>Enchantment</h4>

      <p>Enchantment <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.</p>

      <p>
        All enchantments are mind-affecting <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. Two types of enchantment <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> grant you influence over a subject
        creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Charm:</b> A charm spell changes how the subject views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Compulsion:</b> A compulsion spell forces the subject to act in some manner or changes the way her mind
        works. Some compulsion <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> determine the subject’s actions or the effects on the subject, some compulsion
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> allow you to determine the subject’s actions when you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control
        over the subject.
      </p>

      <h4>Evocation</h4>

      <p>
        Evocation <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> manipulate <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired end. In effect, they
        create something out of nothing. Many of these <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells </a> produce spectacular effects, and evocation <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can deal
        large amounts of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Illusion</h4>

      <p>
        Illusion <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, not
        see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that never happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Figment:</b> A figment spell creates a false sensation. Those who perceive the figment perceive the same
        thing, not their own slightly different versions of the figment. (It is not a personalized mental impression.)
        Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A figment that includes audible effects cannot
        duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell description specifically says it can. If intelligible speech is
        possible, it must be in a language you can speak. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot speak, the image
        produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of something unless you know what it looks like.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because figments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they cannot produce real effects the way that other types
        of illusions can. They cannot cause <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to objects or creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or
        provide protection from the elements. Consequently, these <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are useful for confounding or delaying foes,
        but useless for attacking them directly.
      </p>

      <p>A figment’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Glamer:</b> A glamer spell changes a subject’s sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or
        sound like something else, or even seem to disappear.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Pattern:</b> Like a figment, a pattern spell creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects
        the minds of those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Phantasm: </b>A phantasm spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the subject (or
        subjects) of the spell can perceive. This impression is totally in the minds of the subjects. It is a
        personalized mental impression. (It’s all in their heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually
        see.) Third parties viewing or studying the scene don’t notice the phantasm. All phantasms are mind-affecting
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">Shadow</a>:</b> A <a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">shadow</a> spell creates something that is partially real from extradimensional <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>. Such
        illusions can have real effects. <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a> dealt by a <a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">shadow</a> illusion is real.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">Saving Throws</a> and Illusions (Disbelief ): </b>Creatures encountering an illusion usually do not receive
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        A successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a
        translucent outline.
      </p>

      <p>
        A failed <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> indicates that a character fails to notice something is amiss. A character faced with
        proof that an illusion isn’t real needs no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. If any viewer successfully disbelieves an illusion and
        communicates this fact to others, each such viewer gains a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> with a +4 bonus.
      </p>

      <h4>Necromancy</h4>

      <p>
        Necromancy <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life force. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells </a> involving undead creatures
        make up a large part of this school.
      </p>

      <h4>Transmutation</h4>

      <p>Transmutation <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition.</p>

      <h3 id="section-2-3"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-3">[DESCRIPTOR]</a></h3>

      <p>
        Appearing on the same line as the school and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor that further
        categorizes the spell in some way. Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have more than one descriptor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The descriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>, death, earth, electricity, evil, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>, fire, force,
        good, language-dependent, lawful, <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, mind-affecting, sonic, and water.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the spell interacts with other
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, with unusual creatures, with <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot
        understand or cannot hear what the caster of a language-dependant spell says the spell fails.
      </p>

      <p>A mind-affecting spell works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.</p>

      <h3 id="section-2-4"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">LEVEL</a></h3>

      <p>
        The next line of a spell description gives the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a number between 0 and 9 that defines the spell’s
        relative power. This number is preceded by an abbreviation for the class whose members can cast the spell. The
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a> entry also indicates whether a spell is a domain spell and, if so, what its domain and its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> as a
        domain spell are. A spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> affects the DC for any save allowed against the effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Names of spellcasting classes are abbreviated as follows: <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> Brd; <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> Clr; <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-4">druid </a> Drd; <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-1">paladin</a> Pal; <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a>

      </p>

      <p>
        The domains a spell can be associated with include Air, Animal, Chaos, Death, <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-16">Destruction</a>, Earth, Evil, Fire,
        Good, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">Healing</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">Knowledge</a>, Law, Luck, Magic, Plant, Protection, Strength, Sun, Travel, Trickery, War, and Water.

      <h3 id="section-2-5"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">COMPONENTS</a></h3>

      <p>
        A spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> are what you must do or possess to cast it. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">Components </a> entry in a spell description
        includes abbreviations that tell you what type of <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> it has. Specifics for material, focus, and XP
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> are given at the end of the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a>. Usually you don’t worry about <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>, but when you
        can’t use a component for some reason or when a material or focus component is expensive, then the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>
        are important.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Verbal (V):</b> A verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you must be able
        to speak in a strong voice. A <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-36">silence</a> </i>spell or a gag spoils the incantation (and thus the spell). A
        spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal component that he or she
        tries to cast.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Somatic (S):</b> A somatic component is a measured and precise <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> of the hand. You must have at least
        one hand free to provide a somatic component.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Material (M):</b> A material component is one or more physical substances or objects that are annihilated by
        the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is given for a material component, the cost is
        negligible. Don’t bother to keep <a href="feats.html#section-3-103">track</a> of material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need
        as long as you have your spell component pouch.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Focus (F): </b>A focus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus is not consumed
        when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>, the cost for a focus is negligible unless
        a price is given. Assume that focus <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Divine Focus (DF):</b> A divine focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The divine focus for a
        <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> or a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-1">paladin</a> is a holy symbol appropriate to the character’s faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">Components</a> line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the spell has a focus component or a
        material component (the abbreviation before the slash) and the divine version has a divine focus component (the
        abbreviation after the slash).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>XP Cost (XP):</b> Some powerful <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> entail an <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> to you. No spell can restore the XP
        lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, so you cannot cast the spell unless you
        have enough XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, use those XP for casting
        a spell rather than keeping them and advancing a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The XP are treated just like a material
        component—expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting succeeds.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-6"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">CASTING TIME</a></h3>

      <p>
        Most <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a
        free action.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the beginning of
        your turn in the round after you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of
        those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action, just as noted above for 1- round casting
        times). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> from the
        current round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> before the
        casting is complete, you lose the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spell with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of 1 free action doesn’t count against your normal limit of one spell per round.
        However, you may cast such a spell only once per round. Casting a spell with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of 1 free action
        doesn’t provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You make all pertinent decisions about a spell (<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, target, area, effect, version, and so forth) when the
        spell comes into effect.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-7"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">RANGE</a></h3>

      <p>
        A spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">Range</a> entry of the spell description.
        A spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is the maximum distance from you that the spell’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum
        distance at which you can designate the spell’s point of origin. If any portion of the spell’s area would extend
        beyond this <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, that area is wasted. Standard ranges include the following.
      </p>

      <p><b>Personal:</b> The spell affects only you.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Touch:</b> You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch spell that deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> can score a
        critical hit just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals
        double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on a successful critical hit. Some touch <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch
        as many willing targets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all targets of the spell must be touched in
        the same round that you finish casting the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Close:</b> The spell reaches as far as 25 feet away from you. The maximum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range </a> increases by 5 feet for every
        two full caster levels.
      </p>

      <p><b>Medium:</b> The spell reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>.</p>

      <p><b>Long:</b> The spell reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>.</p>

      <p><b>Unlimited:</b> The spell reaches anywhere on the same plane of existence.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Range Expressed in Feet:</b> Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have no standard <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> category, just a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range </a> expressed in feet.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-8"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-8">AIMING A SPELL</a></h3>

      <p>
        You must make some choice about whom the spell is to affect or where the effect is to originate, depending on
        the type of spell. The next entry in a spell description defines the spell’s target (or targets), its effect, or
        its area, as appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Target or Targets:</b> Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a><i> </i>have a target or targets. You cast these <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> on creatures or
        objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must specifically
        choose that target. You do not have to select your target until you finish casting the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the target of a spell is yourself (the spell description has a line that reads Target: You), you do not
        receive a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>, and <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> does not apply. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a> and <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell Resistance</a> lines are
        omitted from such <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can
        be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or it isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically
        considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is bound,
        cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the spell. Redirecting a
        spell is a move action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.</p>

      <p>
        You must designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">Range</a>
        determines how far away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile it can move regardless of the spell’s
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Ray: </i>Some effects are <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-27">rays</a>. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged
        touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an
        invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as you
        do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> for the creature you’re aiming at.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a ray spell has a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, it’s the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the
        ray itself persists.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a ray spell deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a
        critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on a successful critical hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Spread: </i>Some effects, notably clouds and fogs, spread out from a point of origin, which must be a grid
        intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can’t see. Figure distance by actual
        distance traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread
        effects, count around <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-3">walls</a>, not through them. As with <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, do not trace diagonals across corners. You must
        designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all
        portions of the effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Area:</b> Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> affect an area. Sometimes a spell description specifies a specially defined area, but
        usually an area falls into one of the categories defined below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point where the spell originates, but otherwise you don’t
        control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell is always a grid
        intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance
        from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> for a
        ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of
        the next, you count from intersection to intersection.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of
        distance. If the far edge of a square is within the spell’s area, anything within that square is within the
        spell’s area. If the spell’s area only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square
        is unaffected by the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Burst, Emanation, or Spread: </i>Most <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that affect an area function as a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>, an emanation, or a
        spread. In each case, you select the spell’s point of origin and measure its effect from that point.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> spell affects whatever it catches in its area, even including creatures that you can’t see. It can’t
        affect creatures with total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around
        corners). The default shape for a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> effect is a sphere, but some <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are specifically described as
        cone-shaped. A <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>’s area defines how far from the point of origin the spell’s effect extends.
      </p>

      <p>
        An emanation spell functions like a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> spell, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point of
        origin for the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spread spell spreads out like a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the spell
        spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure the area the spell effect fills by taking into account
        any turns the spell effect takes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere: </i>Most <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that affect an area have a particular shape, such as a cone,
        cylinder, line, or sphere.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from any
        corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and
        thus won’t go around corners.
      </p>

      <p>
        When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell’s point of origin. This point is the center of a
        horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell
        ignores any obstructions within its area.
      </p>

      <p>
        A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of
        your square and extends to the limit of its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A
        line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through.
      </p>

      <p>
        A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts,
        emanations, or spreads.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Creatures: </i>A spell with this kind of area affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell), but it
        affects all creatures in an area of some kind rather than individual creatures you select. The area might be a
        spherical <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> , a cone-shaped <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>, or some other shape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> affect “living creatures,” which means all creatures other than constructs and undead. Creatures in
        the spell’s area that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the creatures affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Objects: </i>A spell with this kind of area affects objects within an area you select (as Creatures, but
        affecting objects instead).
      </p>

      <p><i>Other: </i>A spell can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</p>

      <p>
        <i>(S) Shapeable: </i>If an Area or Effect entry ends with “(S),” you can shape the spell. A shaped effect or
        area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or areas are given as cubes to make it easy to
        model irregular shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater effects
        and areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Line of Effect:</b> A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can affect. A
        line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It’s like line of sight for ranged <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, except that it’s not
        blocked by fog, <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>, and other factors that limit normal sight.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you cast a spell on or to any space in which you <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> to
        create an effect. You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any spell you cast<i>.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an area, creatures, or objects to which it has line of
        effect from its origin (a spherical <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>’s center point, a cone-shaped <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>’s starting point, a cylinder’s
        circle, or an emanation’s point of origin).
      </p>

      <p>
        An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a spell’s line of
        effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a
        barrier for purposes of a spell’s line of effect.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-9"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">DURATION</a></h3>

      <p>A spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">Duration</a> entry tells you how long the magical <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> of the spell lasts.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Timed Durations: </b>Many <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>s are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment. When the
        time is up, the magic goes away and the spell ends. If a spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> is variable the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> is rolled
        secretly (the caster doesn’t know how long the spell will last).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Instantaneous:</b> The spell <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> comes and goes the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences
        might be long-lasting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Permanent: </b>The <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable to
        <i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">dispel magic</a></i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a>:</b> The spell lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a
        standard action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. Anything that could break your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> when
        casting a spell can also break your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> while you’re maintaining one, causing the spell to end.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can’t cast a spell while concentrating on another one. Sometimes a spell lasts for a short time after you
        cease concentrating.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Subjects, Effects, and Areas:</b> If the spell affects creatures directly the result travels with the
        subjects for the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>. If the spell creates an effect, the effect lasts for the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>. The effect
        might move or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> ends. If the spell
        affects an area then the spell stays with that area for its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creatures become subject to the spell when they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.

        <b>Touch <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> and Holding the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">Charge</a>:</b> In most cases, if you don’t dis<a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> a touch spell on the round you
        cast it, you can hold the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> (postpone the discharge of the spell) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks
        round after round. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some touch <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a><i> </i>allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can’t hold the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> of
        such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.
      </p>

      <p><b>Discharge:</b> Occasionally a <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> lasts for a set <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> or until triggered or discharged.</p>

      <p>
        <b>(D) Dismissible:</b> If the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">Duration</a> line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the spell at will. You must be
        within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of the spell’s effect and must speak words of <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-38">dismissal</a>, which are usually a modified form of the
        spell’s verbal component. If the spell has no verbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a gesture.
        Dismissing a spell is a standard action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spell that depends on <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an
        action, since all you have to do to end the spell is to stop concentrating on your turn.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-10"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">SAVING THROW</a></h3>

      <p>
        Usually a harmful spell allows a target to make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> to avoid some or all of the effect. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a> entry in a spell description defines which type of <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> the spell allows and describes how saving
        throws against the spell work.
      </p>

      <p><b>Negates: </b>The spell has no effect on a subject that makes a successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Partial:</b> The spell causes an effect on its subject. A successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> means that some lesser
        effect occurs.
      </p>

      <p><b>Half:</b> The spell deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, and a successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> halves the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> taken (round down).</p>

      <p><b>None:</b> No <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is allowed.</p>

      <p><b>Disbelief:</b> A successful save lets the subject ignore the effect.</p>

      <p>
        <b>(object):</b> The spell can be cast on objects, which receive <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> only if they are magical or if
        they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell, in which case the object
        uses the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> bonus unless its own bonus is greater. (This notation does not mean that a
        spell can be cast only on objects. Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.) A magic item’s
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>(harmless):</b> The spell is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving
        throw if it desires.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Saving Throw Difficulty Class:</b> A <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against your spell has a DC of 10 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell
        + your bonus for the relevant ability (Intelligence for a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>, Charisma for a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a> or <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a>, or Wisdom for
        a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a>, <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-4">druid</a>, <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-1">paladin</a>, or <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a>). A spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> can vary depending on your class. Always use the spell
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> applicable to your class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Succeeding on a Saving Throw: </b>A creature that successfully saves against a spell that has no obvious
        physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack. Likewise,
        if a creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> succeeds against a targeted spell you sense that the spell has failed. You do not
        sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect and area <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Automatic Failures and Successes:</b> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw </a> is always a failure,
        and the spell may cause <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to exposed items (see Items Surviving after a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a>, below). A natural 20
        (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Voluntarily Giving up a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a>:</b> A creature can voluntarily forego a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> and willingly
        accept a spell’s result. Even a character with a special <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance </a> to magic can suppress this quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Items Surviving after a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a>:</b> Unless the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> for the spell specifies otherwise, all
        items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a magical attack. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on
        its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against the effect, however, an exposed item is <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a>ed (if the attack can <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> objects). Refer
        to Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature are
        most likely to be affected and roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>
        against the attack form and take whatever <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> the attack deal.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. It simply is dealt the
        appropriate <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> is a special defensive ability. If your spell is being resisted by a creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>, you must make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> check (1d20 + <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>) at least equal to the creature’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> for the spell to affect that creature. The defender’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> is like an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> against
        magical attacks. Include any adjustments to your <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> to this <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell Resistance</a> entry and the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> of a spell description tell you whether <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>
        protects creatures from the spell. In many cases, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> applies only when a resistant creature is
        targeted by the spell, not when a resistant creature encounters a spell that is already in place.
      </p>

      <p>
        The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> as they do for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>. A
        creature with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> must voluntarily lower the <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> (a standard action) in order to be affected
        by a spell noted as harmless. In such a case, you do not need to make the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> check described above.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-3"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-3">ARCANE SPELLS</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a></h2>

      <p>
        Wizards, sorcerers, and bards cast <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3">arcane spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>. Compared to <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3">arcane spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> are more likely to
        produce dramatic results.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-1"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-3-1">PREPARING WIZARD SPELLS</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a></h3>

      <p>
        A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> limits the number of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> she can prepare and cast. Her high Intelligence score might allow
        her to prepare a few extra <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. She can prepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as
        one spell toward her daily limit. To prepare a spell the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 +
        the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Rest: </b>To prepare her daily <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> must first <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> for 8 hours. The <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard </a> does not have to
        slumber for every minute of the time, but she must refrain from <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, combat, spellcasting, skill use,
        conversation, or any other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If her rest is
        interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time she has to rest in order to clear her
        mind, and she must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing her <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. If the
        character does not need to <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> for some reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful calm before preparing
        any <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Recent Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</b> If a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> has cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> recently, the drain on her resources
        reduces her capacity to prepare <a href="divine-domains-and-spells.html#section-14">new spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>. When she prepares <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> for the coming day, all the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> she has
        cast within the last 8 hours count against her daily limit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Preparation Environment:</b> To prepare any spell, a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to
        allow for proper <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>. The <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from
        overt distractions. Exposure to inclement <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">weather</a> prevents the necessary <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>, as does any injury or
        failed <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> the character might experience while studying. <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">Wizard</a>s also must have access to their
        spellbooks to study from and sufficient <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> to read them by. There is one major exception: A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> can
        prepare a <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-51">read magic</a> </i>spell even without a spellbook.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell Preparation Time:</b> After resting, a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> must study her spellbook to prepare any <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that day.
        If she wants to prepare all her <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, the process takes 1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily
        capacity takes a proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time
        required to achieve the proper mental state.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell Selection and Preparation:</b> Until she prepares <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> from her spellbook, the only <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>
        has available to cast are the ones that she already had prepared from the previous day and has not yet used.
        During the study period, she chooses which <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> to prepare. If a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> already has <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> prepared (from the
        previous day) that she has not cast, she can abandon some or all of them to make room for <a href="divine-domains-and-spells.html#section-14">new spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When preparing <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> for the day, a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> can leave some of these spell slots open. Later during that day, she
        can repeat the preparation process as often as she likes, time and circumstances permitting. During these extra
        sessions of preparation, the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon a previously
        prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because she has cast a spell in the
        meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day, this
        preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> prepares more than one-quarter of her
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell Slots:</b> The various character class tables show how many <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> of each <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> a character can cast
        per day. These openings for daily <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a
        higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> spell slot with a lower-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> of lower

        <b>Prepared Spell Retention:</b> Once a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> prepares a spell, it remains in her mind as a nearly cast spell
        until she uses the prescribed <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> to complete and trigger it or until she abandons it. Certain other
        events, such as the effects of magic items or <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3">special attacks</a> from monsters, can wipe a prepared spell from a
        character’s mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Death and Prepared Spell Retention:</b> If a spellcaster dies, all prepared <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> stored in his or her mind
        are wiped away. Potent magic (such as <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-47">raise dead</a>, <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-73">resurrection</a>, </i>or <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-22">true resurrection</a></i>) can recover
        the lost <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> when it recovers the character.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-2"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-3-2">ARCANE MAGICAL WRITINGS</a></h3>

      <p>
        To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical forces
        involved in the spell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native language or culture. However,
        each character uses the system in her own way. Another person’s magical writing remains incomprehensible to even
        the most powerful <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> until she takes time to study and decipher it.
      </p>

      <p>
        To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in written form in another’s spellbook or on a
        scroll), a character must make a <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> check (DC 20 + the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>). If the skill check fails, the
        character cannot attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-51">read magic</a> </i>spell
        automatically deciphers a magical writing without a skill check. If the person who created the magical writing
        is on hand to help the reader, success is also automatic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering a
        magical writing allows the reader to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the
        spell description). If the magical writing was a scroll and the reader can cast <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3">arcane spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>, she can attempt
        to use the scroll.
      </p>

      <p><a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">Wizard</a> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> and Borrowed Spellbooks</p>

      <p>
        A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she already knows and has recorded in her own
        spellbook, but preparation success is not assured. First, the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> must decipher the writing in the book (see
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3-2">Arcane Magical Writings</a>, above). Once a spell from another spellcaster’s book is deciphered, the reader must
        make a <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> check (DC 15 + spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) to prepare the spell. If the check succeeds, the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> can
        prepare the spell. She must repeat the check to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has
        prepared it before. If the check fails, she cannot try to prepare the spell from the same source again until the
        next day. (However, as explained above, she does not need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.)
      </p>

      <p>Adding <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> to a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">Wizard</a>’s Spellbook</p>

      <p>
        <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">Wizard</a>s can add <a href="divine-domains-and-spells.html#section-14">new spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> to their spellbooks through several methods. If a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard </a> has chosen to specialize in
        a school of magic, she can learn <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> only from schools whose <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> she can cast.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b><a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">Wizard</a>s <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each
        time a character attains a new <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, she gains two <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> of her choice to add to her spellbook. The two
        free <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> must be of spell levels she can cast. If she has chosen to specialize in a school of magic, one of
        the two free <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> must be from her specialty school.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells Copied from Another’s Spellbook or a Scroll:</b> A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> can also add a spell to her book whenever
        she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>’s spellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, the
        <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> must first decipher the magical writing (see <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3-2">Arcane Magical Writings</a>, above). Next, she must spend a day
        studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must make a <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> check (DC 15 + spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>). A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>
        who has specialized in a school of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> gains a +2 bonus on the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> check if the new spell is from her
        specialty school. She cannot, however, learn any <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> from her prohibited schools. If the check succeeds, the
        <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> understands the spell and can copy it into her spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook,
        below). The process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied from a
        magic scroll disappears from the parchment.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the check fails, the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> cannot understand or copy the spell. She cannot attempt to learn or copy that
        spell again until she gains another rank in <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a>. A spell that was being copied from a scroll does not
        vanish from the scroll.
      </p>

      <p>
        In most cases, wizards <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> a fee for the privilege of copying <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> from their spellbooks. This fee is
        usually equal to the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> × 50 gp.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Independent Research:</b> A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> also can research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell or
        creating an entirely new one.
      </p>

      <p>Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook</p>

      <p>Once a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> understands a new spell, she can record it into her spellbook.</p>

      <p><b>Time:</b> The process takes 24 hours, regardless of the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Space in the Spellbook:</b> A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. Even a 0-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> spell
        (cantrip) takes one page. A spellbook has one hundred pages.
      </p>

      <p><b>Materials and Costs:</b> Materials for writing the spell cost 100 gp per page.</p>

      <p>
        Note that a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> she gains for free at each
        new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Replacing and Copying Spellbooks</p>

      <p>
        A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If she already has a
        particular spell prepared, she can write it directly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page (as noted in
        Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, above). The process wipes the prepared spell from her mind, just as
        casting it would. If she does not have the spell prepared, she can prepare it from a borrowed spellbook and then
        write it into a new book.
      </p>

      <p>
        Duplicating an existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, but the task is much easier. The time
        requirement and cost per page are halved.
      </p>

      <p>Selling a Spellbook</p>

      <p>
        Captured spellbooks can be sold for a gp amount equal to one-half the cost of purchasing and inscribing the
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> within (that is, one-half of 100 gp per page of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>). A spellbook entirely filled with <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> (that
        is, with one hundred pages of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> inscribed in it) is worth 5,000 gp.
      </p>

His
        high Charisma score might allow him to cast a few extra <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. A member of either class must have a Charisma
        score of at least 10 + a spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> to cast the spell.

        their <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a> or <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> needs 8 hours of rest (just like a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a>), after which he spends 15 minutes
        concentrating. (A <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> must sing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During this
        period, the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a> or <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> readies his mind to cast his daily allotment of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. Without such a period to
        refresh himself, the character does not regain the spell slots he used up the day before.
      </p>

        Clerics, druids, experienced paladins, and experienced rangers can cast <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>. Unlike <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3">arcane spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>,
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> draw power from a divine source. Clerics gain spell power from deities or from divine forces. The

      <h3 id="section-4-1"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-4-1">PREPARING DIVINE SPELLS</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a></h3>

      <p>
        Divine spellcasters prepare their <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> in largely the same manner as wizards do, but with a few differences.
        The relevant ability for <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> is Wisdom. To prepare a divine spell, a character must have a Wisdom
        score of 10 + the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. Likewise, bonus <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are based on Wisdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Time of Day:</b> A divine spellcaster chooses and prepares <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> ahead of time, just as a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> does.
        However, a divine spellcaster does not require a period of rest to prepare <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. Instead, the character
        chooses a particular part of the day to pray and receive <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. The time is usually associated with some daily
        event. If some event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, he must do so as soon as possible. If
        the character does not stop to pray for <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> at the first opportunity, he must wait until the next day to
        prepare <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell Selection and Preparation:</b> A divine spellcaster selects and prepares <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells </a> ahead of time through
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-25">prayer</a> and meditation at a particular time of day. The time required to prepare <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> is the same as it is for
        a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> (1 hour), as is the requirement for a relatively peaceful environment. A divine spellcaster does not
        have to prepare all his <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> at once. However, the character’s mind is considered fresh only during his or her
        first daily spell preparation, so a divine spellcaster cannot fill a slot that is empty because he or she has
        cast a spell or abandoned a previously prepared spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Divine spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a character’s spell selection is limited to the
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> on the list for his or her class. <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">Cleric</a>s, druids, paladins, and rangers have separate spell lists. A
        <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> also has access to two domains determined during his character creation. Each domain gives him access to
        a domain spell at each spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> from 1st to 9th, as well as a special granted power. With access to two
        domain <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> at each spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>—one from each of his two domains—a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> must prepare, as an extra domain
        spell, one or the other each day for each <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of spell he can cast. If a domain spell is not on the <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a>
        spell list, it can be prepared only in a domain spell slot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell Slots:</b> The character class tables show how many <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> of each <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> a character can cast per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        These openings for daily <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a
        higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> spell slot with a lower <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> of lower
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.

        the spell that the <i>summon nature’s ally </i>spell substitutes for is converted into the <i>summon </i>spell
        as if that spell had been prepared all along.

      <p>
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">Divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> can be written down and deciphered just as <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3">arcane spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> can (see <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3-2">Arcane Magical Writings</a>, above).
        Any character with the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> skill can attempt to decipher the divine magical writing and <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> it.
        However, only characters who have the spell in question (in its divine form) on their class spell list can cast
        a divine spell from a scroll.

      <h3 id="section-4-3"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-4-3">NEW DIVINE SPELLS</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a></h3>

      <p>Divine spellcasters most frequently gain <a href="divine-domains-and-spells.html#section-14">new spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> in one of the following two ways.</p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> Gained at a New Level: </b>Characters who can cast <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> undertake a certain amount of study
        between adventures. Each time such a character receives a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>, he or she learns new
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> from that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Independent Research:</b> A divine spellcaster also can research a spell independently, much as an arcane
        spellcaster can. Only the creator of such a spell can prepare and cast it, unless he decides to share it with
        others.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-5"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">SPECIAL ABILITIES</a></h2>

      <p>
        <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> Usually, a spell-like ability works just like the spell of that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a>. A few
        spell-like abilities are unique; these are explained in the text where they are described.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spell-like ability has no verbal, somatic, or material component, nor does it require a focus or have an XP
        cost. The user activates it mentally. <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a> never affects a spell-like ability’s use, even if the ability
        resembles an arcane spell with a somatic component.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spell-like ability has a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in the ability or spell
        description. In all other ways, a spell-like ability functions just like a spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spell-like abilities are subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a> and to being dispelled by <i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">dispel magic</a></i>. They do not
        function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor
        can they be counterspelled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some creatures are actually sorcerers of a sort. They cast <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3">arcane spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> as sorcerers do, using <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> when
        required. In fact, an individual creature could have some spell-like abilities and also cast other <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> as a
        <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Supernatural Abilities:</b> These abilities cannot be disrupted in combat, as <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can, and they generally
        do not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. Supernatural abilities are not subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>,
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-3">counterspells</a>, or to being dispelled by <i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">dispel magic</a></i>, and do not function in areas where magic is
        suppressed or negated.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Extraordinary Abilities:</b> These abilities cannot be disrupted in combat, as <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can, and they generally
        do not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on
        extraordinary abilities. They are not subject to dispelling, and they function normally in an
        <i><a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-19">antimagic field</a>. </i>Indeed, extraordinary abilities do not qualify as magical, though they may break the
        laws of physics.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Natural Abilities:</b> This category includes abilities a creature has because of its physical nature.
        Natural abilities are those not otherwise designated as extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like.
