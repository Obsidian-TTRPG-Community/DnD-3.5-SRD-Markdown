      <h1><a href="combat-i-basics.html">COMBAT I (BASICS)</a></h1>

      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-1">HOW COMBAT WORKS</a></h2>

      <p>Combat is cyclical; everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle of rounds. Combat follows this sequence:</p>

      <p>1. Each combatant starts out flat-footed. Once a combatant acts, he or she is no longer flat-footed.</p>

      <p>
        2. Determine which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the battle. If some but not all of
        the combatants are aware of their opponents, a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round happens before regular rounds of combat begin. The
        combatants who are aware of the opponents can act in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round, so they roll for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a>. In
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative </a> order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take one
        action (either a standard action or a move action) during the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise </a> round. Combatants who were unaware do not
        get to act in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round. If no one or everyone starts the battle aware, there is no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Combatants who have not yet rolled <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> do so. All combatants are now <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready </a> to begin their first
        regular round of combat.
      </p>

      <p>4. Combatants act in <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> order (highest to lowest).</p>

      <p>
        5. When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat
        until combat ends.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2">COMBAT STATISTICS</a></h2>

      <p>This section summarizes the statistics that determine success in combat, and then details how to use</p>

      <h3 id="section-2-1"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">ATTACK ROLL</a></h3>

      <p>
        An <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> represents your attempt to strike your opponent on your turn in a round. When you make an attack
        roll, you roll a d20 and add your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>. (Other modifiers may also apply to this roll.) If your result
        equals or beats the target’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, you hit and deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Automatic Misses and Hits:</b> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> is always a miss. A natural
        20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a possible critical hit.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-2"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">ATTACK BONUS</a></h3>

      <p>Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> with a melee weapon is:</p>

      <p>Base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> + Strength modifier + size modifier</p>

      <p>With a ranged weapon, your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> is:</p>

      <p>Base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> + Dexterity modifier + size modifier + <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> penalty</p>

      <h3 id="section-2-3"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">DAMAGE</a></h3>

      <p>
        When your attack succeeds, you deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. The type of weapon used determines the amount of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> you deal.
        Effects that modify weapon <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> apply to unarmed strikes and the natural physical attack forms of creatures.
      </p>

      <p><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a> reduces a target’s current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Minimum <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a>:</b> If penalties reduce the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> result to less than 1, a hit still deals 1 point of
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strength Bonus: When you hit with a melee or thrown weapon, including a sling, add your Strength modifier to the
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> result. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies on attacks made with a bow that is not a composite
        bow.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Off-Hand Weapon: </i>When you deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> with a weapon in your off hand, you add only 1/2 your Strength
        bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Wielding a Weapon Two-Handed: </i>When you deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> with a weapon that you are wielding two-handed, you
        add 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. However, you don’t get this higher Strength bonus when using a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> weapon
        with two hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-3">Multiplying</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a>:</b> Sometimes you multiply <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> by some factor, such as on a critical hit. Roll the
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (with all modifiers) multiple times and total the results. <i>Note: </i>When you multiply <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> more
        than once, each multiplier works off the original, unmultiplied <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p><i>Exception: </i>Extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a> over and above a weapon’s normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> are never multiplied.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a>:</b> Certain creatures and magical effects can cause temporary ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (a reduction to
        an ability score).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-4"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">ARMOR CLASS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> (AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to land a solid, damaging blow on you. It’s the
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> result that an opponent needs to achieve to hit you. Your AC is equal to the following: 10 + <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>
        bonus + <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> bonus + Dexterity modifier + size modifier
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> limits your Dexterity bonus, so if you’re wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, you might not be able to apply your
        whole Dexterity bonus to your AC.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes you can’t use your Dexterity bonus (if you have one). If you can’t react to a blow, you can’t use your
        Dexterity bonus to AC. (If you don’t have a Dexterity bonus, nothing happens.)
      </p>

      <p>Other Modifiers: Many other factors modify your AC.</p>

      <p><i>Enhancement Bonuses: </i>Enhancement effects make your <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> better.</p>

      <p><i>Deflection Bonus: </i>Magical deflection effects ward off attacks and improve your AC.</p>

      <p><i>Natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a>: </i>Natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> improves your AC.</p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="feats.html#section-3-27">Dodge</a> Bonuses: </i>Some other AC bonuses represent actively avoiding blows. These bonuses are called <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a>
        bonuses. Any situation that denies you your Dexterity bonus also denies you <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonuses. (Wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>,
        however, does not limit these bonuses the way it limits a Dexterity bonus to AC.) Unlike most sorts of bonuses,
        <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonuses stack with each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Touch Attacks:</b> Some attacks disregard <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, including <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a>s and natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>. In these cases, the
        attacker makes a touch <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> (either ranged or melee). When you are the target of a touch attack, your AC
        doesn’t include any <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> bonus, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield </a> bonus, or natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> bonus. All other modifiers, such as your size
        modifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) apply normally.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-5"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">HIT POINTS</a></h3>

      <p>
        When your hit point total reaches 0, you’re disabled. When it reaches –1, you’re dying. When it gets to –10,
        you’re dead.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-6"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">SPEED</a></h3>

      <p>
        Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> tells you how far you can move in a round and still do something, such as attack or cast a spell.
        Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> depends mostly on your race and what <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> you’re wearing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="races.html#section-2">Dwarves</a>, <a href="races.html#section-4">gnomes</a>, and <a href="races.html#section-7">halflings</a> have a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> of 20 feet (4 squares), or 15 feet (3 squares) when wearing medium
        or heavy <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> (except for <a href="races.html#section-2">dwarves</a>, who move 20 feet in any <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="races.html#section-1">Humans</a>, <a href="races.html#section-3">elves</a>, <a href="races.html#section-5">half-elves</a>, and <a href="races.html#section-6">half-orcs</a> have a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> of 30 feet (6 squares), or 20 feet (4 squares) in medium
        or heavy <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you use two <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a> in a round (sometimes called a “double move” action), you can move up to double your
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. If you spend the entire round to <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> all out, you can move up to quadruple your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (or triple if you
        are in heavy <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-7"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">SAVING THROWS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> to avoid or reduce the
        effect. Like an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>, a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is a d20 roll plus a bonus based on your class, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, and an
        ability score. Your <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw </a> modifier is: Base save bonus + ability modifier
      </p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw Types:</b> The three different kinds of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will:</p>

      <p>
        <i>Fortitude: </i>These saves measure your ability to stand up to physical punishment or attacks against your
        vitality and health. Apply your Constitution modifier to your Fortitude <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Reflex: </i>These saves test your ability to <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> area attacks. Apply your Dexterity modifier to your Reflex
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Will: </i>These saves reflect your <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> to mental influence as well as many magical effects. Apply your
        Wisdom modifier to your Will <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a> Difficulty Class:</b> The DC for a save is determined by the attack itself.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Automatic Failures and Successes:</b> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw </a> is always a failure
        (and may cause <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to exposed items; see Items Surviving after a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a>). A natural 20 (the d20 comes
        up 20) is always a success.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-3"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">INITIATIVE</a></h2>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">Initiative</a> Checks:</b> At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> check. An <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a>
        check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her Dexterity modifier to the roll. Characters act in
        order, counting down from highest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same
        order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> changing; see Special <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">Initiative</a>
        Actions).
      </p>

      <p>
        If two or more combatants have the same <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> check result, the combatants who are tied act in order of
        total <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> modifier (highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should roll again to
        determine which one of them goes before the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Flat-Footed:</b> At the start of a battle, before you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your
        first regular turn in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> order), you are flat-footed. You can’t use your Dexterity bonus to AC (if
        any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues have the uncanny <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> extraordinary ability, which allows them to
        avoid losing their Dexterity bonus to AC due to being flat-footed.
      </p>

      <p>A flat-footed character can’t make <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Inaction:</b> Even if you can’t take actions, you retain your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> score for the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> of the
        encounter.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-1"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">SURPRISE</a></h3>

      <p>When a combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of you, you’re surprised.</p>

      <p>Determining Awareness</p>

      <p>
        Sometimes all the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some
        of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side are
        unaware.
      </p>

      <p>Determining awareness may call for <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> checks, or other checks.</p>

      <p>
        <b>The <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">Surprise</a> Round:</b> If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round
        happens before regular rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the opponents can act in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round, so
        they roll for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a>. In <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of
        their opponents each take a standard action during the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round. You can also take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a> during the
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round. If no one or everyone is <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a>d, no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round occurs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Unaware Combatants:</b> Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don’t get to act in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a>
        round. Unaware combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted yet, so they lose any Dexterity bonus to
        AC.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-4"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY</a></h2>

      <p>
        Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of
        her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Threatened Squares:</b> You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it is not
        your action. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An
        enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If
        you’re unarmed, you don’t normally threaten any squares and thus can’t make <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Reach <a href="equipment.html#section-2">Weapons</a>: </i>Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they
        can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures
        wielding reach <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons </a> threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than
        Medium have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Provoking an Attack of Opportunity: </b>Two kinds of actions can provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>: moving out
        of a threatened square and performing an action within a threatened square.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Moving: </i>Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes an attack of opportunity from the threatening
        opponent. There are two common methods of avoiding such an attack—the 5-foot-step and the withdraw action (see
        below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Performing a Distracting Act: </i>Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> as you divert your attention from the battle. Table: <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5">Actions in Combat</a> notes many of the actions
        that provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Remember that even actions that normally provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> may have exceptions to this rule.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Making an Attack of Opportunity:</b> An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and you can only make
        one per round. You don’t have to make an attack of opportunity if you don’t want to.
      </p>

      <p>
        An experienced character gets additional regular melee attacks (by using the full attack action), but at a lower
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>. You make your attack of opportunity, however, at your normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>—even if you’ve already
        attacked in the round.
      </p>

      <p>
        An attack of opportunity “interrupts” the normal flow of actions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is
        provoked, immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the next character’s turn (or
        complete the current turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character’s turn).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="feats.html#section-3-16">Combat Reflexes</a> and Additional Attacks of Opportunity: </i>If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-16">Combat Reflexes</a> feat you can add
        your Dexterity modifier to the number of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> you can make in a round. This feat does not let
        you make more than one attack for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> from you, you could make two separate <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> (since each one represents a different
        opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn’t count
        as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-5"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5">ACTIONS IN COMBAT</a></h2>

      <h3 id="section-5-1"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-1">THE COMBAT ROUND</a></h3>

      <p>
        Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world. A round presents an opportunity for each character involved
        in a combat situation to take an action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each round’s activity begins with the character with the highest <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> result and then proceeds, in order,
        from there. Each round of a combat uses the same <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative </a> order. When a character’s turn comes up in the
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> sequence, that character performs his entire round’s worth of actions. (For exceptions, see Attacks
        of Opportunity and <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4">Special Initiative Actions</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        For almost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a round or the beginning of a round. A round can be
        a segment of game time starting with the first character to act and ending with the last, but it usually means a
        span of time from one round to the same <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> count in the next round. Effects that last a certain number
        of rounds end just before the same <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> count that they began on.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-2"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-2">ACTION TYPES</a></h3>

      <p>
        An action’s type essentially tells you how long the action takes to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> (within the framework of the
        6-second combat round) and how <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> is treated. There are four types of actions: <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-3">standard actions</a>, move
        actions, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">full-round actions</a>, and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a normal round, you can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> a standard action and a move action, or you can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> a full-round action.
        You can also <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> one or more <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a>. You can always take a move action in place of a standard action.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some situations (such as in a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise</a> round), you may be limited to taking only a single move action or
        standard action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Standard Action:</b> A standard action allows you to do something, most commonly make an attack or cast a
        spell. See Table: <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5">Actions in Combat</a> for other <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-3">standard actions</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Move Action:</b> A move action allows you to move your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> or <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> an action that takes a similar amount
        of time. See Table: <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5">Actions in Combat</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can take a move action in place of a standard action. If you move no actual distance in a round (commonly
        because you have swapped your move for one or more equivalent actions), you can take one 5-foot step either
        before, during, or after the action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Full-Round Action:</b> A full-round action consumes all your effort during a round. The only <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> you can
        take during a full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or after the action. You can also <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> free
        actions (see below).
      </p>

      <p>Some <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">full-round actions</a> do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.</p>

      <p>
        Some <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">full-round actions</a> can be taken as <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-3">standard actions</a>, but only in situations when you are limited to
        performing only a standard action during your round. The descriptions of specific actions, below, detail which
        actions allow this option.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Free Action:</b> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">Free actions</a> consume a very small amount of time and effort. You can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> one or more
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a> while taking another action normally. However, there are reasonable limits on what you can really
        do for free.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Not an Action:</b> Some activities are so minor that they are not even considered <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a>. They
        literally don’t take any time at all to do and are considered an inherent part of doing something else.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Restricted Activity:</b> In some situations, you may be unable to take a full round’s worth of actions. In
        such cases, you are restricted to taking only a single standard action or a single move action (plus free
        actions as normal). You can’t take a full-round action (though you can start or complete a full-round action by
        using a standard action; see below).

      <h4>Attack</h4>

      <p>Making an attack is a standard action.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Melee Attacks: </b>With a normal melee weapon, you can strike any opponent within 5 feet. (Opponents within 5
        feet are considered adjacent to you.) Some melee <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons </a> have reach, as indicated in their descriptions. With a
        typical reach weapon, you can strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can’t strike adjacent foes (those within 5
        feet).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Unarmed Attacks:</b> Striking for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> with punches, kicks, and head butts is much like attacking with a
        melee weapon, except for the following:
      </p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">Attacks of Opportunity</a>: </i>Attacking unarmed provokes an attack of opportunity from the character you
        attack, provided she is armed. The attack of opportunity comes before your attack. An unarmed attack does not
        provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> from other foes nor does it provoke an attack of opportunity from an unarmed foe.
      </p>

      <p>An unarmed character can’t take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> (but see “Armed” Unarmed Attacks, below).</p>

      <p>
        <i>“Armed” Unarmed Attacks: </i>Sometimes a character’s or creature’s unarmed attack counts as an armed attack.
        A <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-6">monk</a>, a character with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-60">Improved Unarmed Strike </a> feat, a spellcaster delivering a touch attack spell, and a
        creature with natural physical <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> all count as being armed.
      </p>

      <p>Note that being armed counts for both offense and defense (the character can make <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>)</p>

      <p>
        <i>Unarmed Strike Damage: </i>An unarmed strike from a Medium character deals 1d3 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (plus your
        Strength modifier, as normal). A Small character’s unarmed strike deals 1d2 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, while a Large
        character’s unarmed strike deals 1d4 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. All <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from unarmed strikes is <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a>.
        Unarmed strikes count as <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> (for purposes of two-weapon attack penalties and so on).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Dealing Lethal Damage: </i>You can specify that your unarmed strike will deal lethal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> before you make
        your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>, but you take a –4 penalty on your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>. If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-60">Improved Unarmed Strike</a> feat,
        you can deal lethal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> with an unarmed strike without taking a penalty on the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ranged Attacks:</b> With a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>d weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the weapon’s
        maximum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> and in line of sight. The maximum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> for a thrown weapon is five <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> increments. For
        projectile <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, it is ten <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range </a> increments. Some ranged <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> have shorter maximum ranges, as specified in
        their descriptions.
      </p>

      <p><b>Attack Rolls:</b> An <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> represents your attempts to strike your opponent.</p>

      <p>
        Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> is 1d20 + your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> with the weapon you’re using. If the result is at least as high as
        the target’s AC, you hit and deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Automatic Misses and Hits:</b> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> is always a miss. A
        natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a possible critical hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Damage Rolls:</b> If the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> result equals or exceeds the target’s AC, the attack hits and you deal
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. Roll the appropriate <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> for your weapon. <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a> is deducted from the target’s current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Multiple Attacks:</b> A character who can make more than one attack per round must use the full attack action
        (see <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">Full-Round Actions</a>, below) in order to get more than one attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shooting or Throwing into a Melee:</b> If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee
        with a friendly character, you take a –4 penalty on your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>. Two characters are engaged in melee if
        they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized
        character is not considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)
      </p>

      <p>
        If your target (or the part of your target you’re aiming at, if it’s a big target) is at least 10 feet away from
        the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the –4 penalty, even if the creature you’re aiming at is engaged
        in melee with a friendly character.
      </p>

      <p><i><a href="feats.html#section-3-78">Precise Shot</a>: </i>If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-78">Precise Shot</a> feat you don’t take this penalty.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Fighting Defensively as a Standard Action:</b> You can choose to fight defensively when attacking. If you do
        so, you take a –4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonus to AC for the same round.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Critical Hits:</b> When you make an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> and get a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), you hit regardless
        of your target’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, and you have scored a threat. The hit might be a critical hit (or “crit”). To find
        out if it’s a critical hit, you immediately make a critical roll—another <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> with all the same modifiers
        as the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll </a> you just made. If the critical roll also results in a hit against the target’s AC, your
        original hit is a critical hit. (The critical roll just needs to hit to give you a crit. It doesn’t need to come
        up 20 again.) If the critical roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        A critical hit means that you roll your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> more than once, with all your usual bonuses, and add the rolls
        together. Unless otherwise specified, the threat <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> for a critical hit on an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> is 20, and the
        multiplier is x2.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Exception:</i><b> </b>Extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> over and above a weapon’s normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is not multiplied when you score a
        critical hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Increased Threat <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">Range</a>:</i><b> </b>Sometimes your threat <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is greater than 20. That is, you can score a
        threat on a lower number. In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit. Any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> that
        doesn’t result in a hit is not a threat.
      </p>

      <p><i>Increased Critical Multiplier:</i><b> </b>Some <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> deal better than double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on a critical hit.</p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> and Critical Hits: </i>A spell that requires an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a><i> </i>can score a critical hit. A spell
        attack that requires no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a><i> </i>cannot score a critical hit.
      </p>

      <h4>Cast a Spell</h4>

      <p>
        Most <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> require 1 standard action to cast. You can cast such a spell either before or after you take a move
        action.
      </p>

      <p><i>Note: </i>You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while casting.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">Components</a>:</b> To cast a spell with a verbal (V) component, your character must speak in a firm voice.
        If you’re gagged or in the area of a <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-36">silence</a> </i>spell, you can’t cast such a spell. A spellcaster who has
        been deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has a verbal component.
      </p>

      <p>
        To cast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture freely with at least one hand. You can’t cast a
        spell of this type while bound, grappling, or with both your hands full or occupied.
      </p>

      <p>
        To cast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine focus (DF) component, you have to have the proper
        materials, as described by the spell. Unless these materials are elaborate<i> </i>preparing these materials is a
        free action. For material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components </a> and focuses whose costs are not listed, you can assume that you have them
        if you have your spell component pouch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have an experience point (XP) component and entail an <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> to you. No spell can
        restore the lost XP. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, so you cannot cast the spell unless you
        have enough XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to achieve a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, immediately spend the XP
        on casting the spell rather than keeping it to advance a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The XP are expended when you cast the spell,
        whether or not the casting succeeds.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Concentration:</b> You must concentrate to cast a spell. If you can’t concentrate you can’t cast a spell. If
        you start casting a spell but something interferes with your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> you must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check
        or lose the spell. The check’s DC depends on what is threatening your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> (see the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a>
        skill). If you fail, the spell fizzles with no effect. If you prepare <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, it is lost from preparation. If
        you cast at will, it counts against your daily limit of <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> even though you did not cast it successfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Concentrating to Maintain a Spell:</b> Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> require continued <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> to keep them going.
        Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. Anything
        that could break your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration </a> when casting a spell can keep you from concentrating to maintain a spell. If
        your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> breaks, the spell ends.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Casting Time:</b> Most <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of 1 standard action. A spell cast in this manner
        immediately takes effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Attacks of Opportunity:</b> Generally, if you cast a spell, you provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> from
        threatening enemies. If you take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from an attack of opportunity, you must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC
        10 + points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> taken + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) or lose the spell. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that require only a free action to cast
        don’t provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Casting on the Defensive:</b> Casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an attack of
        opportunity. It does, however, require a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) to pull off. Failure means
        that you lose the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Touch <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> in Combat:</b> Many <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> have a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of touch. To use these <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, you cast the spell and
        then touch the subject, either in the same round or any time later. In the same round that you cast the spell,
        you may also touch (or attempt to touch) the target. You may take your move before casting the spell, after
        touching the target, or between casting the spell and touching the target. You can automatically touch one
        friend or use the spell on yourself, but to touch an opponent, you must succeed on an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Touch Attacks: </i>Touching an opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed attack and therefore
        does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. However, the act of casting a spell does provoke an attack of
        opportunity. Touch attacks come in two types: melee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks. You can score
        critical hits with either type of attack. Your opponent’s AC against a touch attack does not include any <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>
        bonus, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> bonus, or natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> bonus. His size modifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if
        any) all apply normally.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Holding the Charge: </i>If you don’t dis<a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> the spell in the round when you cast the spell, you can hold
        the dis<a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> of the spell (hold the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>) indefinitely. You can continue to make touch attacks round after
        round. You can touch one friend as a standard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. If you touch
        anything or anyone while holding a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, even unintentionally, the spell dis<a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>s. If you cast another
        spell, the touch spell dissipates. Alternatively, you may make a normal unarmed attack (or an attack with a
        natural weapon) while holding a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>. In this case, you aren’t considered armed and you provoke attacks of
        opportunity as normal for the attack. (If your unarmed attack or natural weapon attack doesn’t provoke attacks
        of opportunity, neither does this attack.) If the attack hits, you deal normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> for your unarmed attack or
        natural weapon and the spell dis<a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>s. If the attack misses, you are still holding the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Dismiss a Spell:</b> Dismissing an active spell is a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of
        opportunity.
      </p>

      <h4>Activate Magic Item</h4>

      <p>
        Many magic items don’t need to be activated. However, certain magic items need to be activated, especially
        potions, <a href="magic-items-iv-scrolls-staffs-and-wands.html#section-1">scrolls</a>, <a href="magic-items-iv-scrolls-staffs-and-wands.html#section-3">wands</a>, <a href="magic-items-iii-potions-rings-and-rods.html#section-3">rods</a>, and <a href="magic-items-iv-scrolls-staffs-and-wands.html#section-2">staffs</a>. Activating a magic item is a standard action (unless the item
        description indicates otherwise).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell Completion Items: </b>Activating a spell completion item is the equivalent of casting a spell. It
        requires <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> and provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. You lose the spell if your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> is broken,
        and you can attempt to activate the item while on the defensive, as with casting a spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell Trigger, Command Word, or Use-Activated Items: </b>Activating any of these kinds of items does not
        require <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> and does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Use Special Ability</h4>

      <p>
        Using a special ability is usually a standard action, but whether it is a standard action, a full-round action,
        or not an action at all is defined by the ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> Using a spell-like ability works like casting a spell in that it requires
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> and provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. Spell-like abilities can be disrupted. If your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>
        is broken, the attempt to use the ability fails, but the attempt counts as if you had used the ability. The
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of a spell-like ability is 1 standard action, unless the ability description notes otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Using a Spell-Like Ability on the Defensive: </i>You may attempt to use a spell-like ability on the
        defensive, just as with casting a spell. If the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) fails, you can’t use
        the ability, but the attempt counts as if you had used the ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Supernatural Abilities:</b> Using a supernatural ability is usually a standard action (unless defined
        otherwise by the ability’s description). Its use cannot be disrupted, does not require <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>, and does
        not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Extraordinary Abilities:</b> Using an extraordinary ability is usually not an action because most
        extraordinary abilities automatically happen in a reactive fashion. Those extraordinary abilities that are
        actions are usually <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-3">standard actions</a> that cannot be disrupted, do not require <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>, and do not provoke
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Total Defense</h4>

      <p>
        You can defend yourself as a standard action. You get a +4 <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonus to your AC for 1 round. Your AC improves
        at the start of this action. You can’t combine total defense with fighting defensively or with the benefit of
        the <a href="feats.html#section-3-15">Combat Expertise</a> feat (since both of those require you to declare an attack or full attack). You can’t make
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> while using total defense.
      </p>

      <h4>Start/Complete Full-Round Action</h4>

      <p>
        The “start full-round action” standard action lets you start undertaking a full-round action, which you can
        complete in the following round by using another standard action. You can’t use this action to start or complete
        a full attack, <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>, or withdraw.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-4"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">MOVE ACTIONS</a></h3>

      <p>With the exception of specific <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>-related skills, most <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a> don’t require a check.</p>

      <h4>Move</h4>

      <p>
        The simplest move action is moving your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. If you take this kind of move action during your turn, you can’t
        also take a 5-foot step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many nonstandard modes of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> are covered under this category, including climbing (up to one-quarter of
        your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>) and swimming (up to one-quarter of your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Accelerated Climbing:</b> You can <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">climb</a> one-half your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> as a move action by accepting a –5 penalty on
        your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">Climb</a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Crawling:</b> You can crawl 5 feet as a move action. Crawling incurs <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> from any
        attackers who threaten you at any point of your crawl.
      </p>

      <h4>Draw or Sheathe a Weapon</h4>

      <p>
        Drawing a weapon so that you can use it in combat, or putting it away so that you have a free hand, requires a
        move action. This action also applies to weapon-like objects carried in easy reach, such as <a href="magic-items-iv-scrolls-staffs-and-wands.html#section-3">wands</a>. If your
        weapon or weapon-like object is stored in a pack or otherwise out of easy reach, treat this action as retrieving
        a stored item.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have a base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> of +1 or higher, you may draw a weapon as a free action combined with a regular
        move. If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-106">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat, you can draw two <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> or one-handed <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> in the time it
        would normally take you to draw one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Drawing ammunition for use with a ranged weapon (such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, or shuriken) is a free
        action.
      </p>

      <h4><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">Ready</a> or Loose a <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">Shield</a></h4>

      <p>
        Strapping a <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> to your arm to gain its <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> bonus to your AC, or unstrapping and dropping a <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> so you
        can use your <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> hand for another purpose, requires a move action. If you have a base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> of +1 or
        higher, you can <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> or loose a <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> as a free action combined with a regular move.
      </p>

      <p>Dropping a carried (but not worn) <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> is a free action.</p>

      <h4>Manipulate an Item</h4>

      <p>In most cases, moving or manipulating an item is a move action.</p>

      <p>
        This includes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a heavy object, and opening a
        door. Examples of this kind of action, along with whether they incur an attack of opportunity, are given in
        Table: <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5">Actions in Combat</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Direct or Redirect a Spell</h4>

      <p>
        Some <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a><i> </i>allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the spell.
        Redirecting a spell requires a move action and does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> or require <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Stand Up</h4>

      <p>Standing up from a prone position requires a move action and provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>

      <h4><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">Mount</a>/Dismount a Steed</h4>

      <p>Mounting or dismounting from a steed requires a move action.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Fast Mount or Dismount:</b> You can <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> or dismount as a free action with a DC 20 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> check (your <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>
        check penalty, if any, applies to this check). If you fail the check, <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>ing or dis<a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>ing is a move action
        instead. (You can’t attempt a fast <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> or fast dismount unless you can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> or dismount as a move
        action in the current round.)
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-5"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">FULL-ROUND ACTIONS</a></h3>

      <p>
        A full-round action requires an entire round to complete. Thus, it can’t be coupled with a standard or a move
        action, though if it does not involve moving any distance, you can take a 5-foot step.
      </p>

      <h4>Full Attack</h4>

      <p>
        If you get more than one attack per round because your base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> is high enough, because you fight with
        two <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> or a double weapon or for some special reason you must use a full-round action to get your
        additional attacks. You do not need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can see how the
        earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> you can take during a full attack is a 5-foot step. You may take the step before, after, or
        between your attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you get multiple attacks because your base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> is high enough, you must make the attacks in order
        from highest bonus to lowest. If you are using two <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, you can strike with either weapon first. If you are
        using a double weapon, you can strike with either part of the weapon first.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Deciding between an Attack or a Full Attack:</b> After your first attack, you can decide to take a move
        action instead of making your remaining attacks, depending on how the first attack turns out. If you’ve already
        taken a 5-foot step, you can’t use your move action to move any distance, but you could still use a different
        kind of move action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Fighting Defensively as a Full-Round Action:</b> You can choose to fight defensively when taking a full
        attack action. If you do so, you take a –4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonus to AC for
        the same round.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Cleave:</b> The extra attack granted by the <a href="feats.html#section-3-13">Cleave</a> feat or <a href="feats.html#section-3-37">Great Cleave</a> feat can be taken whenever they
        apply. This is an exception to the normal limit to the number of attacks you can take when not using a full
        attack action.
      </p>

      <h4>Cast a Spell</h4>

      <p>
        A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the beginning of
        your turn in the round after you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of
        those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action). These actions must be consecutive and
        uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the invocations, gestures, and
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> from one round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>
        after starting the spell and before it is complete, you lose the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        You only provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> when you begin casting a spell, even though you might continue casting
        for at least one full round. While casting a spell, you don’t threaten any squares around you.
      </p>

      <p>This action is otherwise identical to the cast a spell action described under <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-3">Standard Actions</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Casting a Metamagic Spell:</b> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-3-3">Sorcerers and bards</a> must take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one
        enhanced by a metamagic feat) than a regular spell. If a spell’s normal <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> is 1 standard action,
        casting a metamagic version of the spell is a full-round action for a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a> or <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a>. Note that this isn’t the
        same as a spell with a 1-round <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a>—the spell takes effect in the same round that you begin casting, and
        you aren’t required to continue the invocations, gestures, and <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration </a> until your next turn. For <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>
        with a longer <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a>, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the metamagic spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clerics must take more time to spontaneously cast a metamagic version of a <i>cure </i>or
        <i>inflict </i>spell.<i> </i>Spontaneously casting a metamagic version of a spell with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time </a> of 1
        standard action is a full-round action, and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> with longer casting times take an extra full-round action to
        cast.
      </p>

      <h4>Use Special Ability</h4>

      <p>
        Using a special ability is usually a standard action, but some may be <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">full-round actions</a>, as defined by the
        ability.
      </p>

      <h4>Withdraw</h4>

      <p>
        Withdrawing from melee combat is a full-round action. When you withdraw, you can move up to double your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>.
        The square you start out in is not considered threatened by any opponent you can see, and therefore visible
        enemies do not get <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> against you when you move from that square. (Invisible enemies still
        get <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> against you, and you can’t withdraw from combat if you’re blinded.) You can’t take a
        5-foot step during the same round in which you withdraw.
      </p>

      <p>
        If, during the process of withdrawing, you move out of a threatened square (other than the one you started in),
        enemies get <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> as normal.
      </p>

      <p>You may not withdraw using a form of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> for which you don’t have a listed <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that despite the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a> of this action, you don’t actually have to leave combat entirely.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Restricted Withdraw:</b> If you are limited to taking only a standard action each round you can withdraw as a
        standard action. In this case, you may move up to your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed </a> (rather than up to double your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>).
      </p>

      <h4><a href="feats.html#section-3-84">Run</a></h4>

      <p>
        You can <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> as a full-round action. (If you do, you do not also get a 5-foot step.) When you <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>, you can move
        up to four times your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> in a straight line (or three times your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> if you’re in heavy <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>). You lose
        any Dexterity bonus to AC unless you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">Run</a> feat
      </p>

      <p>
        You can <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score, but after that you must make a DC 10
        Constitution check to continue <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>ning. You must check again each round in which you continue to <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>, and the DC
        of this check increases by 1 for each check you have made. When you fail this check, you must stop <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>ning. A
        character who has <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> to his limit must rest for 1 minute (10 rounds) before running again. During a rest
        period, a character can move no faster than a normal move action.
      </p>

      <p>You can’t <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> across difficult terrain or if you can’t see where you’re going.</p>

      <p>A <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> represents a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> of about 12 miles per hour for an unencumbered human.</p>

      <h4>Move 5 Feet through Difficult Terrain</h4>

      <p>
        In some situations, your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> may be so hampered that you don’t have sufficient <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> even to move 5 feet (a
        single square). In such a case, you may spend a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction,
        even diagonally. Even though this looks like a 5-foot step, it’s not, and thus it provokes attacks of
        opportunity normally.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-6"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">FREE ACTIONS</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">Free actions</a> don’t take any time at all, though there may be limits to the number of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a> you can
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> in a turn. <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">Free actions</a> rarely incur <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. Some common <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a> are described
        below.
      </p>

      <h4>Drop an Item</h4>

      <p>Dropping an item in your space or into an adjacent square is a free action.</p>

      <h4>Drop Prone</h4>

      <p>Dropping to a prone position in your space is a free action.</p>

      <h4>Speak</h4>

      <p>
        In general, speaking is a free action that you can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> even when it isn’t your turn. Speaking more than few
        sentences is generally beyond the limit of a free action.
      </p>

      <h4>Cease <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> on Spell</h4>

      <p>You can stop concentrating on an active spell as a free action.</p>

      <h4>Cast a Quickened Spell</h4>

      <p>
        You can cast a quickened spell (see the <a href="feats.html#section-3-80">Quicken Spell</a> feat) or any spell whose <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> is designated as a
        free action as a free action. Only one such spell can be cast in any round, and such <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> don’t count toward
        your normal limit of one spell per round. Casting a spell with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of a free action doesn’t incur an
        attack of opportunity.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-5-7"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-7">MISCELLANEOUS ACTIONS</a></h3>

      <h4>Take 5-Foot Step</h4>

      <p>
        You can move 5 feet in any round when you don’t <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> any other kind of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>. Taking this 5-foot step
        never provokes an attack of opportunity. You can’t take more than one 5-foot step in a round, and you can’t take
        a 5-foot step in the same round when you move any distance.
      </p>

      <p>You can take a 5-foot step before, during, or after your other actions in the round.</p>

      <p>
        You can only take a 5-foot-step if your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> isn’t hampered by difficult terrain or <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>. Any creature
        with a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> of 5 feet or less can’t take a 5-foot step, since moving even 5 feet requires a move action for
        such a <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-42">slow</a> creature.
      </p>

      <p>You may not take a 5-foot step using a form of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> for which you do not have a listed <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>.</p>

      <h4>Use Feat</h4>

      <p>
        Certain <a href="feats.html">feats</a> let you take special <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5">actions in combat</a>. Other <a href="feats.html">feats</a> do not require actions themselves, but they
        give you a bonus when attempting something you can already do. Some <a href="feats.html">feats</a> are not meant to be used within the
        framework of combat. The individual <a href="feats.html#section-3">feat descriptions</a> tell you what you need to know about them.
      </p>

      <h4>Use Skill</h4>

      <p>
        Most skill uses are <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-3">standard actions</a>, but some might be <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a>, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">full-round actions</a>, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a>, or
        something else entirely.
      </p>

      <p>The individual <a href="skills-i.html#section-3">skill descriptions</a> tell you what sorts of actions are required to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> skills.</p>

      <p>
        Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> measure how hard you are to kill. No matter how many <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> you lose, your character isn’t
        hindered in any way until your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> drop to 0 or lower.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-6-1"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-1">LOSS OF HIT POINTS</a></h3>

      <p>The most common way that your character gets hurt is to take lethal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and lose <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a></p>

      <p>
        <b>What <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">Hit Points</a> Represent:</b> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">Hit points</a> mean two things in the game world: the ability to take physical
        punishment and keep going, and the ability to turn a serious blow into a less serious one.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Effects of Hit Point Damage:</b> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a> doesn’t <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-42">slow</a> you down until your current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> reach 0 or lower.

      </p>

      <p>At from –1 to –9 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, you’re dying.</p>

      <p>At –10 or lower, you’re dead.</p>

        <b>Massive Damage: </b>If you ever sustain a single attack deals 50 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> or more and it doesn’t kill
        you outright, you must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. If this <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> fails, you die regardless of your
        current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>. If you take 50 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> or more from multiple attacks, no one of which dealt 50 or
        more points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> itself, the massive <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rule does not apply.

      <p>
        You can only take a single move or standard action each turn (but not both, nor can you take full-round
        actions). You can take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a> without further injuring yourself, but if you <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> any standard action

        increased your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, you are now at –1 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, and you’re dying.

      </p>

      <p>
        You can also become disabled when recovering from dying. In this case, it’s a step toward recovery, and you can

        d% to see whether the dying character becomes stable. He has a 10% chance of becoming stable. If he doesn’t, he
        loses 1 hit point. (A character who’s unconscious or dying can’t use any special action that changes the

      </p>

      <p>If the character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> drop to –10 or lower, he’s dead.</p>

        A stable character who has been tended by a healer or who has been magically healed eventually regains

        still in danger, and he may yet slip away.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Recovering with Help:</b> One hour after a tended, dying character becomes stable, roll d%. He has a 10%
        chance of becoming conscious, at which point he is disabled (as if he had 0 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>). If he remains
        unconscious, he has the same chance to revive and become disabled every hour. Even if unconscious, he recovers
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> naturally. He is back to normal when his <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> rise to 1 or higher.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Recovering without Help:</b> A severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance,
        however, of recovering on his own.
      </p>

      <p>
        A character who becomes stable on his own (by making the 10% roll while dying) and who has no one to tend to him
        still loses <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, just at a slower rate. He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious. Each time he
        misses his hourly roll to become conscious, he loses 1 hit point. He also does not recover <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> through
        natural <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even once he becomes conscious and is disabled, an unaided character still does not recover <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>
        naturally. Instead, each day he has a 10% chance to start recovering <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> naturally (starting with that
        day); otherwise, he loses 1 hit point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once an unaided character starts recovering <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> naturally, he is no longer in danger of naturally losing
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (even if his current hit point total is negative).

      <h3 id="section-6-6"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">HEALING</a></h3>

      <p>
        After taking <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, you can recover <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> through natural <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a> or through magical <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a>. In any case,
        you can’t regain <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> past your full normal hit point total.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Natural Healing:</b> With a full night’s rest (8 hours of <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> or more), you recover 1 hit point per
        character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. Any significant interruption during your rest prevents you from <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a> that night.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you undergo complete bed rest for an entire day and night, you recover twice your character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in hit
        points.
      </p>

      <p><b>Magical Healing:</b> Various abilities and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can restore <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Healing Limits:</b> You can never recover more <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> than you lost. Magical <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing </a> won’t raise your
        current <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> higher than your full normal hit point total.

        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">Healing</a> Ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">Damage</a>:</b> Ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is temporary, just as hit point <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is. Ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> returns
        at the rate of 1 point per night of rest (8 hours) for each affected ability score. Complete bed rest restores 2
        points per day (24 hours) for each affected ability score.

      <h3 id="section-6-7"><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">TEMPORARY HIT POINTS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Certain effects give a character <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a>. When a character gains <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a>, note his
        current hit point total. When the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points </a> go away the character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> drop to his current
        hit point total. If the character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> are below his current hit point total at that time, all the
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a> have already been lost and the character’s hit point total does not drop further.
      </p>

      <p>When <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a> are lost, they cannot be restored as real <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> can be, even by magic.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Increases in Constitution Score and Current Hit Points: </b>An increase in a character’s Constitution score,
        even a temporary one, can give her more <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (an effective hit point increase), but these are not
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a>. They can be restored and they are not lost first as <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a> are.
