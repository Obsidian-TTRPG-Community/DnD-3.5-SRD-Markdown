      <h2 id="section-1">ALIGNMENT</h2>

      <p>
        A creature’s general moral and personal attitudes are represented by its alignment: lawful good, neutral good,
        chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alignment is a tool for developing your character’s identity. It is not a straitjacket for restricting your
        character. Each alignment represents a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies, so two
        characters of the same alignment can still be quite different from each other. In addition, few people are
        completely consistent.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-1">GOOD VS. EVIL</h3>

      <p>
        Good characters and creatures protect innocent life. Evil characters and creatures debase or destroy innocent
        life, whether for fun or profit.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Good” implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good characters
        make personal sacrifices to help others.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Evil” implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others
        and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or out of duty
        to some evil deity or master.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent but lack the
        commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed to others by personal
        relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being good or evil can be a conscious choice. For most people, though, being good or evil is an attitude that
        one recognizes but does not choose. Being neutral on the good–evil axis usually represents a lack of commitment
        one way or the other, but for some it represents a positive commitment to a balanced view. While acknowledging
        that good and evil are objective states, not just opinions, these folk maintain that a balance between the two
        is the proper place for people, or at least for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral rather than good or evil. Even deadly vipers
        and tigers that eat people are neutral because they lack the capacity for morally right or wrong behavior.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-2">LAW VS. CHAOS</h3>

      <p>
        Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall
        short of their duties.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and
        do what they promise if they feel like it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Law” implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can
        include close-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, judgmentalness, and a lack of adaptability. Those
        who consciously promote lawfulness say that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can depend on
        each other and make the right decisions in full confidence that others will act as they should.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Chaos” implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the downside, chaos can include recklessness,
        resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote chaotic
        behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows people to express themselves fully and lets society
        benefit from the potential that its individuals have within them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a normal respect for authority and feels neither a
        compulsion to obey nor a compulsion to rebel. She is honest but can be tempted into lying or deceiving others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Devotion to law or chaos may be a conscious choice, but more often it is a personality trait that is recognized
        rather than being chosen. Neutrality on the lawful–chaotic axis is usually simply a middle state, a state of not
        feeling compelled toward one side or the other. Some few such neutrals, however, espouse neutrality as superior
        to law or chaos, regarding each as an extreme with its own blind spots and drawbacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral. Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited,
        but they do not have the moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-3">THE NINE ALIGNMENTS</h3>

      <p>
        Nine distinct alignments define all the possible combinations of the lawful–chaotic axis with the good–evil
        axis. Each alignment description below depicts a typical character of that alignment. Remember that individuals
        vary from this norm, and that a given character may act more or less in accord with his or her alignment from
        day to day. Use these descriptions as guidelines, not as scripts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first six alignments, lawful good through chaotic neutral, are the standard alignments for player
        characters. The three evil alignments are for monsters and villains.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Lawful Good, “Crusader”: </b>A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act.
        She combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. She tells the truth, keeps
        her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty
        go unpunished.
      </p>

      <p>Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and compassion.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Neutral Good, “Benefactor”:</b> A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is
        devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them..
      </p>

      <p>
        Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias for or against
        order.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Chaotic Good, “Rebel”:</b> A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for
        what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he’s kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right
        but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what
        to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.
      </p>

      <p>Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Lawful Neutral, “Judge”: </b>A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs
        her. Order and organization are paramount to her. She may believe in personal order and live by a code or
        standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you are reliable and honorable without being a
        zealot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Neutral, “Undecided”:</b> A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn’t feel strongly
        one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of
        conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than
        evil—after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she’s not personally
        committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good,
        evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the
        best, most balanced road in the long run.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Chaotic Neutral, “Free Spirit”:</b> A chaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an individualist
        first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn’t strive to protect others’ freedom. He avoids authority,
        resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt
        organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a
        desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic neutral
        character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge
        as to cross it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it represents true freedom from both society’s
        restrictions and a do-gooder’s zeal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Lawful Evil, “Dominator”:</b> A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his
        code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He cares about tradition, loyalty, and order but not about
        freedom, dignity, or life. He plays by the rules but without mercy or compassion. He is comfortable in a
        hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their actions but
        according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. He is loath to break laws or promises.
      </p>

      <p>
        This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from
        those who oppose him on moral grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in
        cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They
        imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to
        good. Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end
        unto itself. They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master.
      </p>

      <p>Lawful evil is sometimes called “diabolical,” because devils are the epitome of lawful evil.</p>

      <p>
        Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents methodical, intentional, and frequently
        successful evil.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Neutral Evil, “Malefactor”:</b> A neutral evil villain does whatever she can get away with. She is out for
        herself, pure and simple. She sheds no tears for those she kills, whether for profit, sport, or convenience. She
        has no love of order and holds no illusion that following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any better
        or more noble. On the other hand, she doesn’t have the restless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil
        villain has.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake. Most often, such villains
        are devoted to evil deities or secret societies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neutral evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents pure evil without honor and without
        variation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Chaotic Evil, “Destroyer”: </b>A chaotic evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for
        destruction drive him to do. He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If he is
        simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and
        chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly
        organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts
        only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.
      </p>

      <p>Chaotic evil is sometimes called “demonic” because demons are the epitome of chaotic evil.</p>

      <p>
        Chaotic evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents the destruction not only of beauty and life
        but also of the order on which beauty and life depend.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2">VITAL STATISTICS</h2>

      <h3 id="section-2-1">AGE</h3>

      <p>
        You can choose or randomly generate your character’s age. If you choose it, it must be at least the minimum age
        for the character’s race and class (see Table: Random Starting Ages). Your character’s minimum starting age is
        the adulthood age of his or her race plus the number of dice indicated in the entry corresponding to the
        character’s race and class on Table: Random Starting Ages.
      </p>

      <p>Alternatively, refer to Table: Random Starting Ages and roll dice to determine how old your character is.</p>

      <p>
        With age, a character’s physical ability scores decrease and his or her mental ability scores increase (see
        Table: Aging Effects). The effects of each aging step are cumulative. However, none of a character’s ability
        scores can be reduced below 1 in this way.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a character reaches venerable age, secretly roll his or her maximum age, which is the number from the
        Venerable column on Table: Aging Effects plus the result of the dice roll indicated on the Maximum Age column on
        that table, and records the result, which the player does not know. A character who reaches his or her maximum
        age dies of old age at some time during the following year.
      </p>

      <p>
        The maximum ages are for player characters. Most people in the world at large die from pestilence, accidents,
        infections, or violence before getting to venerable age.
