      <p>
        <i>First Aid: </i>You usually use first <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-4">aid</a> to save a dying character. If a character has negative <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>
        and is losing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable.
        A stable character regains no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> but stops losing them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Long-Term Care: </i>Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a>
        check is successful, the patient recovers <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> or ability score points (lost to ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>) at twice
        the normal rate: 2 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points </a> per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> for each
        full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points
        for each full day of complete rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on)
        that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> activity for the healer. You
        cannot give long-term care to yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Treat Wound from Caltrop, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-59">Spike Growth</a>, or <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-60">Spike Stones</a>: </i>A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop
        moves at one-half normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. A successful <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> check removes this <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> penalty.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature wounded by a <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-59">spike growth</a> </i>or <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-60">spike stones</a> </i>spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take
        injuries that reduce his <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to
        dress the victim’s injuries and succeeding on a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> check against the spell’s save DC.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Treat Poison: </i>To treat <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> means to tend a single character who has been <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>ed and who is going to
        take more <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>, you make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>, whichever is higher.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Treat Disease: </i>To treat a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a> means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a> effects, you make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> check. The diseased character uses your check result or
        his or her <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>, whichever is higher.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Providing first <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-4">aid</a>, treating a wound, or treating <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a> is a standard action. Treating a
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease </a> or tending a creature wounded by a <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-59">spike growth</a> </i>or <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-60">spike stones</a> </i>spell takes 10 minutes of
        work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Try Again:</b> Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> check again without proof of the original
        check’s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-4">aid</a>, assuming the target of the previous attempt
        is still alive.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A character with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-86">Self-Sufficient</a> feat gets a +2 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> checks.</p>

      <p>A <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">heal</a>er’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a> checks.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-2"><a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">HIDE</a> <small>(DEX; <a href="equipment.html#section-3">ARMOR</a> CHECK PENALTY)</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Check:</b> Your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check is opposed by the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to
        one-half your normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> at no penalty. When moving at a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> greater than one-half but less than
        your normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, you take a –5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> while attacking,
        running or charging.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> checks depending on its size
        category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.
      </p>

      <p>
        You need <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> or <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> in order to attempt a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check. Total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> or total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment </a> usually (but
        not always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check, since nothing can see you anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        If people are observing you, even casually, you can’t <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a>. You can <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> around a corner or behind <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> so that
        you’re out of sight and then <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a>, but the others then know at least where you went.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check; see below), though, you can attempt to
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a>. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check if you can get to a hiding
        place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a>.) This check, however, is made at a –10 penalty because you have to move fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Sniping: </i>If you’ve already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged
        attack, then immediately <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> again. You take a –20 penalty on your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check to conceal yourself after the
        shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Creating a Diversion to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a>: </i>You can use <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> to help you <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a>. A successful <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check can give you
        the momentary diversion you need to attempt a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check while people are aware of you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Usually none. Normally, you make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check as part of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, so it doesn’t take a separate
        action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> checks if you’re moving.
      </p>

      <p>If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-98">Stealthy</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> checks.</p>

      <p>
        A 13th-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a> can attempt a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn’t grant <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> or
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>. A 17thlevel <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a> can do this even while being observed.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-3"><a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">INTIMIDATE</a> <small>(CHA)</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Check:</b> You can change another’s behavior with a successful check. Your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">Intimidate</a> check is opposed by the
        target’s modified <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> check (1d20 + character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> + target’s Wisdom bonus [if any] + target’s
        modifiers on saves against <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>). If you beat your target’s check result, you may treat the target as friendly,
        but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal
        attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-9">Diplomacy</a> skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your
        presence, and for 1d6×10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target’s default attitude toward you shifts to
        unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise
        frustrates your efforts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Demoralize Opponent: </i>You can also use <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">Intimidate</a> to weaken an opponent’s resolve in combat. To do so,
        make an <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">Intimidate</a> check opposed by the target’s modified <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> check (see above). If you win, the target
        becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-3">ability checks</a>, and saving
        throws. You can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">intimidate</a> only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Varies. Changing another’s behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in
        combat is a standard action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Try Again:</b> Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check
        succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn’t help. If the initial check
        fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is
        futile.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You gain a +4 bonus on your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">Intimidate</a> check for every size category that you are larger than
        your target. Conversely, you take a –4 penalty on your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">Intimidate</a> check for every size category that you are
        smaller than your target.
      </p>

      <p>A character immune to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> can’t be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.</p>

      <p>If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-75">Persuasive</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">Intimidate</a> checks.</p>

      <p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a>, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-3">Intimidate</a> checks.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-4"><a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">JUMP</a> <small>(STR; <a href="equipment.html#section-3">ARMOR</a> CHECK PENALTY)</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Check:</b> The DC and the distance you can <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> vary according to the type of <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a> you are attempting (see
        below).
      </p>

      <p>
        Your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> check is modified by your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. If your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> is 30 feet then no modifier based on <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed </a> applies to
        the check. If your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> is less than 30 feet, you take a –6 penalty for every 10 feet of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed </a> less than 30
        feet. If your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        All <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a
        straight line before attempting the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a>. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump </a> is doubled.
      </p>

      <p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> in a round.</p>

      <p>
        If you have ranks in <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> and you succeed on a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you
        attempt a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Long <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a>: </i>A long <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a> is a horizontal <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a>, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of
        the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a>, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a> is
        equal to the distance jumped (in feet).
      </p>

      <p>
        If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don’t
        clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>
        grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a
        DC 15 <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">Climb</a> check.

        <i>High <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a>: </i>A high <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a> is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something
        overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.

      <p>
        If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you

        you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a> from which you <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a>ed. As with a long
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a>, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.

        Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature.
        The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given
        size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Quadrupedal creatures don’t have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size
        category smaller.

        <i>Hop Up: </i>You can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a> up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC
        10 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, so if your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then
        hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not
        get a running start.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Jumping Down: </i>If you intentionally <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a> from a height, you take less <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> than you would if you just
        fell. The DC to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a> down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump </a> down, so the DC is
        not doubled if you do not get a running start.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you succeed on the check, you take <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> None. A <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> check is included in your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, so it is part of a move action. If you <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run </a> out
        of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> mid-<a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a>, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be a move

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> Effects that increase your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> also increase your jumping distance, since your check is

        Like the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-7">Craft</a> and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-10">Profession</a> skills, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">Knowledge</a> actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">Knowledge</a>
        represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>

      <p>
        • Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical
        beasts)
      </p>

      <p>• Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)</p>

      <p>• Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</p>

      <p>• Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</p>

      <p>• History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)</p>

      <p>• Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)</p>

      <p>• Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">weather</a>, vermin)</p>

      <p>• Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)</p>

      <p>• Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)</p>

      <p>
        • The <a href="planes.html">planes</a> (the Inner <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>, the Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>, <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>, <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>, outsiders, elementals,
        magic related to the <a href="planes.html">planes</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Check:</b> Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15
        (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).
      </p>

      <p>
        In many cases, you can use this skill to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In
        general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of
        useful information about that monster.
      </p>

      <p>
        For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Usually none. In most cases, making a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">Knowledge</a> check doesn’t take an action—you simply know the
        answer or you don’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Try Again:</b> No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let
        you know something that you never learned in the first place.
      </p>

      <p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">Knowledge</a> (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft </a> checks.</p>

        hands in combat. Make your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this
        round because you need to use the other to control your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Stay in Saddle: </i>You can react instantly to try to avoid <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a> when your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> rears or bolts

        <i>Fight with Warhorse: </i>If you direct your war-trained <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> to attack in battle, you can still make your
        own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.
      </p>

        <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>’s <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a>. If you fail your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> check,
        you fall off the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> when it leaps and take the appropriate <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (at least 1d6 points). This usage
        does not take an action, but is part of the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>’s <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>.

        increases the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the creature. You can use this
        ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> deals twice as much <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> as
        the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).

      <p>
        <i>Control Mount in Battle: </i>As a move action, you can attempt to control a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> <a href="monsters-animals.html#section-21">horse</a>, <a href="monsters-animals.html#section-33">pony</a>, heavy <a href="monsters-animals.html#section-21">horse</a>,

        else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Fast Mount or Dismount: </i>You can attempt to <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> or dis<a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> from a <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> of up to one size category
        larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you
        fail the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> check, <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>ing or dis<a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>ing is a move action. You can’t use fast <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount </a> or dis<a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> on a <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>
        more than one size category larger than yourself.

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action. Other checks are a move action, a free
        action, or no action at all, as noted above.

      <p><b>Special:</b> If you are riding bareback, you take a –5 penalty on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> checks.</p>

        definition, a mind-affecting effect),<i> </i>even if that person isn’t aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if
        the target is dominated (see <i>dominate person</i>), the DC is only 15 because of the limited <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of the
        target’s activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Discern Secret Message: </i>You may use <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> to detect that a hidden <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-31">message</a> is being transmitted via
        the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> skill. In this case, your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> check is opposed by the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check of the character
        transmitting the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-31">message</a>. For each piece of information relating to the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-31">message</a> that you are missing, you take a
        –2 penalty on your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being
        communicated, but you can’t learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you
        intercept and understand the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-31">message</a>. If you fail by 4 or less, you don’t detect any hidden communication. If
        you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Trying to gain information with <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could
        spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.
      </p>

      <p><b>Try Again:</b> No, though you may make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> check for each <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check made against you.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-2">ranger</a> gains a bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.
      </p>

      <p>If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-73">Negotiator</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> checks.</p>

      <p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a>, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-9">Diplomacy</a> checks.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Check:</b> A DC 10 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-14">Sleight of Hand</a> check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor
        feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to
        note where the item went.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer’s <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot </a> check. The
        observer’s success doesn’t prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> a small object (including a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart,
        sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-14">Sleight of Hand</a> check is opposed by the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check of anyone
        observing you or the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-12">Search</a> check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-12">search</a>er gains a +4 bonus on
        the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-12">Search</a> check, since it’s generally easier to find such an object than to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a> it. A dagger is easier to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">hide</a>
        than most <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, and grants you a +2 bonus on your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-14">Sleight of Hand </a> check to conceal it. An
        extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-14">Sleight of Hand</a>
        check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy <a href="equipment.html#section-4-4">clothing</a> (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.
      </p>

      <p>Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p>
        If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-14">Sleight of Hand</a> check to obtain it.
        The opponent makes a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-14">Sleight of Hand</a> check result you
        achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless
        of whether you got the item.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also use <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-14">Sleight of Hand</a> to entertain an audience as though you were using the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">Perform</a> skill. In such a
        case, your “act” encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.

      <p>
        <b>Check:</b> The <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check is opposed by the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn’t
        intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check is necessary to notice it.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible creature near you, though you
        can’t actually see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> is also used to detect someone in <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">disguise</a> (see the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">Disguise</a> skill), and to read lips when you can’t hear
        or understand what someone is saying.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such
        checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if
        the character making the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).

        <i>Read Lips: </i>To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you must be within 30 feet of the
        speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and understand the speaker’s language. (This use of the skill is
        language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must
        maintain a line of sight to the lips being read.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute’s worth of speaking, but you
        usually still miss certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can’t read the speaker’s lips. If the
        check fails by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in
        this case, so that you don’t know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.

      <p>
        <b>Action: </b>Varies. Every time you have a chance to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a> something in a reactive manner you can make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a>
        check without using an action. Trying to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">spot</a> something you failed to see previously is a move action. To read
        lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> check, and you can’t <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> any other action

      <p>
        <b>Check:</b> Make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a> check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim </a> at up to
        one-half your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (as a move action). If you fail by 4
        or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are underwater, either because you failed a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a> check or because you are swimming underwater
        intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your
        Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a> or <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-6">free actions</a>. If you take a
        standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> for which you
        can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only
        half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to
        continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution
        check, you begin to drown.
      </p>

      <p>The DC for the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a> check depends on the water, as given on the table below.</p>

        <i>Activate Blindly: </i>Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate
        such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you’re not and even if you
        don’t know it. You do have to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must
        speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use
        Magic Device check if you’ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you
        can’t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>
        gets released but it doesn’t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the
        wrong target or that uncontrolled magical <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> is released, dealing 2d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to you. This mishap

        skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Emulate an Ability Score: </i>To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability
        (Intelligence for <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, Wisdom for <a href="magic-overview.html#section-4">divine spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>, or Charisma for <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a> or <a href="spell-list-i.html#section-1">bard spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a>). Your
        effective ability score (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the
        scroll) is your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the
        appropriate ability, you don’t need to make this check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Emulate an Alignment: </i>Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user’s <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>.
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> lets you use these items as if you were of an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> of your choice. You can emulate only
        one <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Emulate a Class Feature: </i>Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this
        case, your effective <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in the emulated class equals your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> check result minus 20.&nbsp; This
        skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if
        you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment </a> requirement, you must
        meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> with a separate <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> check (see
        above).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Emulate a Race: </i>Some magic items work only for members of certain <a href="races.html">races</a>, or work better for members of
        those <a href="races.html">races</a>. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Use a Scroll: </i>If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast
        a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll’s spell on your class spell list. <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> allows you to
        use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>
        of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a
        minimum score (10 + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) in the appropriate ability. If you don’t have a sufficient score in that
        ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> check (see above).
      </p>

      <p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Use a Wand: </i>Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand’s spell on your class spell list. This use of
        the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the
        skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as <a href="magic-items-iv-scrolls-staffs-and-wands.html#section-2">staffs</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> None. The <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the
        magic item.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Try Again:</b> Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then
        you can’t try to activate that item again for 24 hours.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>

      <p>You can’t <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-1">aid another</a> on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.</p>

      <p>If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-65">Magical Aptitude</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-21">Use Magic Device</a> checks.</p>

        <i>Secure a Grappling Hook: </i>Securing a grappling hook requires a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-22">Use Rope</a> check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet
        of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that
        the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling
        hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so
        that you don’t know whether the rope will hold your weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Bind a Character: </i>When you bind another character with a rope, any <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-12">Escape Artist</a> check that the bound
        character makes is opposed by your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-22">Use Rope</a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don’t even
        make your <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-22">Use Rope</a> check until someone tries to escape.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.
        Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action that
        provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-38">Binding</a> a character takes 1
        minute.

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-22">Use Rope</a> checks. If you cast an
        <i>animate rope </i>spell on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on any <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-22">Use Rope</a> checks you make when using
        that rope.
