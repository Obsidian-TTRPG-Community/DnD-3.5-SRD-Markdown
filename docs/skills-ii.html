<p><i>First
Aid: </i>You
usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative
hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or
1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit
points but stops losing them.</p>

<p><i>Long-Term
Care: </i>Providing
long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal
check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points
(lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a
full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of
complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4
ability score points for each full day of complete rest.</p>

<p>You
can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies
(bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving
long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give
long-term care to yourself.</p>

<p><i>Treat
Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones: </i>A creature wounded by stepping on a
caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this
movement penalty.</p>

<p>A
creature wounded by a <i>spike growth </i>or <i>spike stones </i>spell must
succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third.
Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the
victim’s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.</p>

<p><i>Treat
Poison: </i>To
treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is
going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every
time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a
Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving
throw, whichever is higher.</p>

<p><i>Treat
Disease: </i>To
treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she
makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The
diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever
is higher.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Providing first aid,
treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease
or tending a creature wounded by a <i>spike growth </i>or <i>spike stones </i>spell
takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light
activity.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without proof of
the original check’s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first
aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> A character with the
Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.</p>

<p>A
healer’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.</p>



<h3>HIDE <small>(DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> Your Hide check is
opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to
one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed
greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a –5 penalty.
It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or
charging.</p>

<p>A
creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide
checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small
+4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.</p>

<p>You
need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or
total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the
need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.</p>

<p>If
people are observing you, even casually, you can’t hide. You can run around a
corner or behind cover so that you’re out of sight and then hide, but the
others then know at least where you went.</p>

<p>If
your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check; see
below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention
from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some
kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank
you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a –10 penalty because you
have to move fast.</p>

<p><i>Sniping:
</i>If you’ve
already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one
ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a –20 penalty on your Hide
check to conceal yourself after the shot.</p>

<p><i>Creating
a Diversion to Hide: </i>You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check
can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while
people are aware of you.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Usually none. Normally,
you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn’t take a separate
action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above)
is a move action.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> If you are invisible, you
gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide
checks if you’re moving.</p>

<p>If
you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.</p>

<p>A
13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, even
if it doesn’t grant cover or concealment. A 17thlevel ranger can do this even
while being observed.</p>



<h3>INTIMIDATE <small>(CHA)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> You can change another’s
behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the
target’s modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target’s
Wisdom bonus [if any] + target’s modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat
your target’s check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for
the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target
retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or
advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for
additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your
presence, and for 1d6×10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target’s
default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly,
to hostile).</p>

<p>If
you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or
useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.</p>

<p><i>Demoralize
Opponent: </i>You
can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent’s resolve in combat. To do so,
make an Intimidate check opposed by the target’s modified level check (see
above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character
takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can
intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see
you.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Varies. Changing
another’s behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent
in combat is a standard action.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the
initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and
a retry doesn’t help. If the initial check fails, the other character has
probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is
futile.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> You gain a +4 bonus on
your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger than your
target. Conversely, you take a –4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every
size category that you are smaller than your target.</p>

<p>A
character immune to fear can’t be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent
creatures.</p>

<p>If
you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>



<h3>JUMP <small>(STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> The DC and the distance
you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see
below).</p>

<p>Your
Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier
based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you
take a –6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed
is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.</p>

<p>All
Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that
you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you
do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.</p>

<p>Distance
moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.</p>

<p>If
you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet
(when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone
unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.</p>

<p><i>Long
Jump: </i>A
long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At
the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of
the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped
(in feet).</p>

<p>If
your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the
check by less than 5, you don’t clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15
Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the
far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires
a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.</p>

<p><i>High
Jump: </i>A
high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp
something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.</p>

<p>If
you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached
the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move
action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach
the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped.
As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at
least 20 feet.</p>

<p>Obviously,
the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the
character or creature. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can
reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the
table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without
jumping.)</p>

<p>Quadrupedal
creatures don’t have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them
as being one size category smaller.</p>

<p><i>Hop
Up: </i>You
can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small
boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if
your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You
do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you
do not get a running start.</p>

<p><i>Jumping
Down: </i>If
you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if
you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get
a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a
running start.</p>

<p>If
you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10
fewer feet than you actually did.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> None. A Jump check is
included in your movement, so it is part of a move action. If you run out of
movement mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on
your next turn) must be a move action to complete the jump.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> Effects that increase
your movement also increase your jumping distance, since your check is modified
by your speed.</p>

<p>If
you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on Jump checks for any jumps made
after a running start.</p>

<p>A
halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because halflings are agile and
athletic.</p>

<p>If
you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.</p>



<h3>KNOWLEDGE <small>(INT; TRAINED ONLY)</small></h3>

<p>Like
the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of
unrelated skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, possibly
an academic or even scientific discipline.</p>

<p>Below
are listed typical fields of study.</p>

<p>•
Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases,
constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</p>

<p>•
Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)</p>

<p>•
Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</p>

<p>•
Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</p>

<p>•
History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)</p>

<p>•
Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions,
humanoids)</p>

<p>•
Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles,
weather, vermin)</p>

<p>•
Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)</p>

<p>•
Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy
symbols, undead)</p>

<p>•
The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal
Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)</p>

<p><b>Check:</b> Answering a question
within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for
basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>

<p>In
many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special
powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the
monster’s HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful
information about that monster.</p>

<p>For
every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another
piece of useful information.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Usually none. In most
cases, making a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action—you simply know the
answer or you don’t.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second
time doesn’t let you know something that you never learned in the first place.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a
+2 bonus on Search checks made to find secret doors or hidden compartments.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on
Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a +2 bonus on bardic
knowledge checks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather
Information checks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival
checks made in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill,
marsh, mountains, or plains).</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and royalty), you get a +2
bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a +2 bonus on turning
checks against undead.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on
Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on
Survival checks made while underground.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature)
checks.</p>

<p><b>Untrained:</b> An untrained Knowledge
check is simply an Intelligence check. Without actual training, you know only
common knowledge (DC 10 or lower).</p>



<h3>LISTEN <small>(WIS)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> Your Listen check is
either made against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that you might
hear, or it is opposed by your target’s Move Silently check.</p>

<p>In
the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the table could be
replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the indicated DC would be their
average check result. </p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Varies. Every time you
have a chance to hear something in a reactive manner (such as when someone
makes a noise or you move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without
using an action. Trying to hear something you failed to hear previously is a
move action.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Yes. You can try to hear something that you failed to hear previously with no
penalty.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> When several characters
are listening to the same thing, a single 1d20 roll can be used for all the
individuals’ Listen checks.</p>

<p>A
fascinated creature takes a –4 penalty on Listen checks made as reactions.</p>

<p>If
you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Listen checks.</p>

<p>A
ranger gains a bonus on Listen checks when using this skill against a favored
enemy.</p>

<p>An
elf, gnome, or halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Listen checks. </p>

<p>A
half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Listen checks..</p>

<p>A
sleeping character may make Listen checks at a –10 penalty. A successful check
awakens the sleeper.</p>



<h3>MOVE SILENTLY <small>(DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> Your Move Silently check
is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to
one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than
one-half but less than your full speed, you take a –5 penalty. It’s practically
impossible (–20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.</p>

<p>Noisy
surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. When
you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty on your Move
Silently check as indicated below.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b>None. A Move Silently
check is included in your movement or other activity, so it is part of another
action.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> The master of a cat
familiar gains a +3 bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>

<p>A
halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>

<p>If
you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>



<h3>OPEN LOCK <small>(DEX; TRAINED ONLY)</small></h3>

<p>Attempting
an Open Lock check without a set of thieves’ tools imposes a –2 circumstance
penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is employed. If you use masterwork
thieves’ tools, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>

<p><b>Check:</b> The DC for opening a lock
varies from 20 to 40, depending on the quality of the lock, as given on the
table below.</p>

<p><b>Untrained:</b> You cannot pick locks
untrained, but you might successfully force them open.</p>



<h3>PERFORM <small>(CHA)</small></h3>

<p>Like
Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate
skills.</p>

<p>You
could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a
separate skill.</p>

<p>Each
of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods,
instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided for each category
below.</p>

<h3>• <small>Act (comedy, drama, mime)</small></h3>

<h3>• <small>Comedy (buffoonery,
limericks, joke-telling)</small></h3>

<h3>• <small>Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)</small></h3>

<h3>• <small>Keyboard instruments
(harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)</small></h3>

<h3>• <small>Oratory (epic, ode,
storytelling)</small></h3>

<h3>• <small>Percussion instruments
(bells, chimes, drums, gong)</small></h3>

<h3>• <small>String instruments
(fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)</small></h3>

<h3>• <small>Wind instruments (flute,
pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)</small></h3>

<h3>• <small>Sing (ballad, chant,
melody)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> You can impress audiences
with your talent and skill.</p>

</tbody></table>



<p>A
masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform
checks that involve its use.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Varies. Trying to earn
money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening’s work to a full
day’s performance. The bard’s special Perform-based abilities are described in
that class’s description.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don’t negate previous failures, and an
audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced
against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> A bard must have at least
3 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his
countersong or his <i>fascinate </i>ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform
skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his <i>suggestion </i>ability, 12
ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his <i>song of freedom </i>ability,
18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his <i>mass suggestion </i>ability.
See Bardic Music in the bard class description.</p>

<p>In
addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with sleight of
hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells (especially illusions).</p>



<h3>PROFESSION <small>(WIS; TRAINED ONLY)</small></h3>

<p>Like
Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession is actually a number of separate
skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each
purchased as a separate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in
creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a
vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. </p>

<p><b>Check:</b> You can practice your
trade and make a decent living, earning about half your Profession check result
in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of
your trade, how to perform the profession’s daily tasks, how to supervise
helpers, and how to handle common problems.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Not applicable. A single
check generally represents a week of work.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an income cannot be
retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you.
Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next
period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be
retried.</p>

<p><b>Untrained:</b> Untrained laborers and
assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an
average of 1 silver piece per day.</p>



<h3>RIDE <small>(DEX)</small></h3>

<p>If
you attempt to ride a creature that is ill suited as a mount, you take a –5
penalty on your Ride checks.</p>

<p><b>Check:</b> Typical riding actions
don’t require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount
without a problem.</p>

<p>The
following tasks do require checks.</p>

<p><i>Guide
with Knees: </i>You
can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use
both hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you
fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to
control your mount.</p>

<p><i>Stay
in Saddle: </i>You
can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts
unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>

<p><i>Fight
with Warhorse: </i>If
you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your
own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.</p>

<p><i>Cover:
</i>You can
react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover.
You can’t attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail
your Ride check, you don’t get the cover benefit. This usage does not take an
action.</p>

<p><i>Soft
Fall: </i>You
can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount—when it
is killed or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take
1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>

<p><i>Leap:
</i>You can
get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride
modifier or the mount’s Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the
creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it
leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage
does not take an action, but is part of the mount’s movement.</p>

<p><i>Spur
Mount: </i>You
can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride
check increases the mount’s speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of
damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but each
consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount
as the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).</p>

<p><i>Control
Mount in Battle: </i>As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse,
pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in
battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You
do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.</p>

<p><i>Fast
Mount or Dismount: </i>You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to
one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you
still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting
or dismounting is a move action. You can’t use fast mount or dismount on a
mount more than one size category larger than yourself.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Varies. Mounting or
dismounting normally is a move action. Other checks are a move action, a free
action, or no action at all, as noted above.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> If you are riding
bareback, you take a –5 penalty on Ride checks.</p>

<p>If
your mount has a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks
related to staying in the saddle.</p>

<p>The
Ride skill is a prerequisite for the feats Mounted Archery, Mounted Combat,
Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge,</p>

<p>Trample.</p>

<p>If
you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.</p>



<h3>SEARCH <small>(INT)</small></h3>

</tbody></table>



<p><b>Action:</b> It takes a full-round
action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> An elf has a +2 racial
bonus on Search checks, and a half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a
half-elf) who simply passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can
make a Search check to find that door.</p>

<p>If
you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks.</p>

<p>The
spells <i>explosive runes, fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, </i>and <i>teleportation
circle </i>create magic traps that a rogue can find by making a successful
Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using Disable Device.
Identifying the location of a <i>snare </i>spell has a DC of 23. <i>Spike
growth </i>and <i>spike stones </i>create magic traps that can be found using
Search, but against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the
individual spell descriptions for details.</p>

<p>Active
abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or more create
barely visible energy fluctuations. These fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on
Search checks to locate such abjuration spells.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow
tracks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a
+2 bonus on Search checks to find secret doors or hidden compartments.</p>

<p><b>Restriction:</b> While anyone can use
Search to find a trap whose DC is 20 or lower, only a rogue can use Search to
locate traps with higher DCs. (<i>Exception: </i>The spell <i>find traps </i>temporarily
enables a cleric to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)</p>

<p>A
dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill to find a
difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is built into or out
of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search check from his stonecunning
ability.</p>



<h3>SENSE MOTIVE <small>(WIS)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> A successful check lets
you avoid being bluffed (see the Bluff skill). You can also use this skill to
determine when “something is up” (that is, something odd is going on) or to
assess someone’s trustworthiness. </p>

</tbody></table>



<p><i>Hunch:
</i>This use
of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can
get the feeling from another’s behavior that something is wrong, such as when
you’re talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that
someone is trustworthy.</p>

<p><i>Sense
Enchantment: </i>You
can tell that someone’s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect
(by definition, a mind-affecting effect),<i> </i>even if that person isn’t
aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see <i>dominate
person</i>), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target’s
activities.</p>

<p><i>Discern
Secret Message: </i>You
may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via
the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff
check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information
relating to the message that you are missing, you take a –2 penalty on your
Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden
is being communicated, but you can’t learn anything specific about its content.
If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If
you fail by 4 or less, you don’t detect any hidden communication. If you fail
by 5 or more, you infer some false information.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Trying to gain
information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could
spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against
you.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> A ranger gains a bonus on
Sense Motive checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>

<p>If
you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>



<h3>SLEIGHT OF HAND <small>(DEX; TRAINED ONLY; ARMOR
CHECK PENALTY)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> A DC 10 Sleight of Hand
check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of
legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an
observer is determined to note where the item went.</p>

<p>When
you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the
observer’s Spot check. The observer’s success doesn’t prevent you from
performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.</p>

<p>You
can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged
weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of
Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or the Search
check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus
on the Search check, since it’s generally easier to find such an object than to
hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a
+2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small
object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your
Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a
cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.</p>

<p>Drawing
a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of
opportunity.</p>

<p>If
you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight
of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a Spot check to detect the
attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you
tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the
attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.</p>

<p>You
can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you were using
the Perform skill. In such a case, your “act” encompasses elements of
legerdemain, juggling, and the like.</p>

normally is a standard action. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check
as a free action by taking a –20 penalty on the check.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Yes, but after an initial failure, a second Sleight of Hand attempt against the
same target (or while you are being watched by the same observer who noticed
your previous attempt) increases the DC for the task by 10.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> If you have the Deft
Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>

<p><b>Untrained:</b> An untrained Sleight of
Hand check is simply a Dexterity check. Without actual training, you can’t
succeed on any Sleight of Hand check with a DC higher than 10, except for
hiding an object on your body.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Not applicable.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Not applicable. There are no Speak Language checks to fail.</p>

<p>The
Speak Language skill doesn’t work like other skills. Languages work as follows.</p>

<p>•
You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your race), plus
an additional number of languages equal to your starting Intelligence bonus.</p>

<p>•
You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but instead of
buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you can speak.</p>

<p>•
You don’t make Speak Language checks. You either know a language or you don’t.</p>

<p>•
A literate character (anyone but a barbarian who has not spent skill points to
become literate) can read and write any language she speaks. Each language has
an alphabet, though sometimes several spoken languages share a single alphabet.</p>

<p><b>Check:</b> You can identify spells and
magic effects. The DCs for Spellcraft checks relating to various tasks are
summarized on the table above.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Varies, as noted above.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
See above.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> If you are a specialist
wizard, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks when dealing with a spell or
effect from your specialty school. You take a –5 penalty when dealing with a
spell or effect from a prohibited school (and some tasks, such as learning a
prohibited spell, are just impossible).</p>

<p>If
you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft
checks to decipher spells on scrolls.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device
checks related to scrolls.</p>

<p>Additionally,
certain spells allow you to gain information about magic, provided that you
make a successful Spellcraft check as detailed in the spell description.</p>



<h3>SPOT <small>(WIS)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> The Spot skill is used
primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot
check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen.
Sometimes a creature isn’t intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see,
so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.</p>

<p>A
Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an
invisible creature near you, though you can’t actually see it.</p>

<p>Spot
is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Disguise skill), and to
read lips when you can’t hear or understand what someone is saying.</p>

<p>Spot
checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter
begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the
two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character
making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).</p>

</tbody></table>



<p><i>Read
Lips: </i>To
understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you must be within 30 feet
of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and understand the speaker’s
language. (This use of the skill is language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but
it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a
line of sight to the lips being read.</p>

<p>If
your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute’s
worth of speaking, but you usually still miss certain details. If the check
fails by 4 or less, you can’t read the speaker’s lips. If the check fails by 5
or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is
rolled secretly in this case, so that you don’t know whether you succeeded or
missed by 5.</p>

<p><b>Action:
</b>Varies.
Every time you have a chance to spot something in a reactive manner you can
make a Spot check without using an action. Trying to spot something you failed
to see previously is a move action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a
full minute before making a Spot check, and you can’t perform any other action
(other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see previously at no
penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per minute.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> A fascinated creature
takes a –4 penalty on Spot checks made as reactions.</p>

<p>If
you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spot checks.</p>

<p>A
ranger gains a bonus on Spot checks when using this skill against a favored
enemy.</p>

<p>An
elf has a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>

<p>A
half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>

<p>The
master of a hawk familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in daylight or other
lighted areas.</p>

<p>The
master of an owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadowy or other
darkened areas.</p>



<h3>SURVIVAL <small>(WIS)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> You can keep yourself and
others safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs for various
tasks that require Survival checks.</p>

<p>Survival
does not allow you to follow difficult tracks unless you are a ranger or have
the Track feat (see the Restriction section below).</p>

  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>



<p><b>Action:</b> Varies. A single Survival
check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival
check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even
longer.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus
noted in the table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The
result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting
lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation
calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to
avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can
retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of
searching.</p>

<p><b>Restriction:</b> While anyone can use
Survival to find tracks (regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC
for the task is 10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat)
can use Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Survival, you can automatically determine where true north lies in
relation to yourself.</p>

<p>A
ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this skill to find or follow
the tracks of a favored enemy.</p>

<p>If
you have the Self-Sufficient feat, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival
checks made while underground.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival
checks in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill,
marsh, mountains, and plains).</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on
Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on
Survival checks made while on other planes.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to
find or follow tracks.</p>



<h3>SWIM <small>(STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</small></h3>

<p><b>Check:</b> Make a Swim check once
per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to
one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a
move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water.
If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.</p>

<p>If
you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are
swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your
breath for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score, but only if you
do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard
action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the
duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round.
(Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as
long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution
check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that
check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.</p>

<p>The
DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.</p>

  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>





<p>Each
hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of
nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> A successful Swim check
allows you to swim one-quarter of your speed as a move action or one-half your
speed as a full-round action.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> Swim checks are subject
to double the normal armor check penalty and encumbrance penalty.</p>

<p>If
you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Swim checks.</p>

<p>If
you have the Endurance feat, you get a +4 bonus on Swim checks made to avoid
taking nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>

<p>A
creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed
without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature always can choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a
creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a
straight line.</p>



<h3>TUMBLE <small>(DEX; TRAINED ONLY; ARMOR
CHECK PENALTY)</small></h3>

<p>You
can’t use this skill if your speed has been reduced by armor, excess equipment,
or loot.</p>

<p><b>Check:</b> You can land softly when
you fall or tumble past opponents. You can also tumble to entertain an audience
(as though using the Perform skill). The DCs for various tasks involving the
Tumble skill are given on the table below.</p>

<p><i>Accelerated
Tumbling: </i>You
try to tumble past or through enemies more quickly than normal. By accepting a
–10 penalty on your Tumble checks, you can move at your full speed instead of
one-half your speed.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Not applicable. Tumbling
is part of movement, so a Tumble check is part of a move action.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Usually no. An audience, once it has judged a tumbler as an uninteresting
performer, is not receptive to repeat performances.</p>

<p>You
can try to reduce damage from a fall as an instant reaction only once per fall.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Tumble, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively
instead of the usual +2 dodge bonus to AC.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +6 dodge bonus to AC when
executing the total defense standard action instead of the usual +4 dodge bonus
to AC.</p>

<p>If
you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance and Jump checks.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.</p>



<h3>USE MAGIC DEVICE <small>(CHA; TRAINED ONLY)</small></h3>

<p>Use
this skill to activate magic</p>

<p><b>Check:</b> You can use this skill to
read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic
item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if
you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.</p>

<p>You
make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand.
If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an
ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per
hour.</p>

<p>You
must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know
what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that
purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are
summarized on the table below.</p>

<p><i>Activate
Blindly: </i>Some
magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can
activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or
action, even when you’re not and even if you don’t know it. You do have to
perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must
speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You
get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you’ve activated the
item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can’t
activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap
means that magical energy gets released but it doesn’t do what you wanted it to
do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that
uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you.
This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run
when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.</p>

<p><i>Decipher
a Written Spell: </i>This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with
the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a
written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.</p>

<p><i>Emulate
an Ability Score: </i>To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the
appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells,
or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score
(appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to cast the spell from
the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have
a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don’t need to make this
check.</p>

<p><i>Emulate
an Alignment: </i>Some
magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user’s alignment.
Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of
your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.</p>

<p><i>Emulate
a Class Feature: </i>Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic
item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use
Magic Device check result minus 20.&nbsp; This skill does not let you actually
use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if
you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an
alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an
appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).</p>

<p><i>Emulate
a Race: </i>Some
magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members
of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice.
You can emulate only one race at a time.</p>

<p><i>Use
a Scroll: </i>If
you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally,
to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll’s spell on your class
spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a
particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster
level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting
a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the
appropriate ability. If you don’t have a sufficient score in that ability, you
must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see
above).</p>

<p>This
use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.</p>

<p><i>Use
a Wand: </i>Normally,
to use a wand, you must have the wand’s spell on your class spell list. This
use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on
your class spell list. This use of the skill also applies to other spell
trigger magic items, such as staffs.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> None. The Use Magic
Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the
magic item.</p>

<p><b>Try
Again:</b>
Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and
you fail, then you can’t try to activate that item again for 24 hours.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> You cannot take 10 with
this skill.</p>

<p>You
can’t aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may
attempt such a check.</p>

<p>If
you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device
checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to
scrolls.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic
Device checks related to scrolls.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to Spellcraft
checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.</p>



<h3>USE ROPE <small>(DEX)</small></h3>

</tbody></table>



<p><i>Secure
a Grappling Hook: </i>Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope check (DC 10,
+2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC
of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch
and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the
grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting
weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don’t know whether the rope
will hold your weight.</p>

<p><i>Bind
a Character: </i>When
you bind another character with a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound
character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check.</p>

<p>You
get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to
escape from bonds. You don’t even make your Use Rope check until someone tries
to escape.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b> Varies. Throwing a
grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.
Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed
is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two
ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.</p>

<p><b>Special:</b> A silk rope gives you a
+2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks. If you cast an <i>animate rope </i>spell
on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when
using that rope.</p>

<p>These
bonuses stack.</p>

<p>If
you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks.</p>

<p><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more
ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a
knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist
checks when escaping from rope bonds.</p>

<p>If
you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on checks made to
bind someone.</p>
