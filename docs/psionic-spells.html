      <h2 id="section-1">SPELL DESCRIPTIONS</h2>

      <p>The following spell descriptions are presented in alphabetical order.</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-1">Brain Spider</h3>

      <p>Divination [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level: </b>Cleric 8, Mind 7</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M, DF</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> Up to eight living creatures</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        This spell allows you to eavesdrop as a standard action on the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once,
        hearing as desired:
      </p>

      <p>• Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire.</p>

      <p>
        • Information from all minds about one particular topic, thing, or being, one nugget of information per caster
        level.
      </p>

      <p>• A study of the thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail.</p>

      <p>
        Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature’s mind, you can attempt (as a standard
        action) to implant a <i>suggestion </i>in the mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make
        another Will saving throw to resist the <i>suggestion, </i>using the save DC of the <i>brain spider </i>spell.
        (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by
        the <i>suggestion.</i>) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the
        <i>brain spider </i>spell for that creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can affect all intelligent beings of your choice within range (up to the limit of eight), beginning with
        known or named beings. Language is not a barrier, and you need not personally know the beings The spell cannot
        reach those who make a successful Will save.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Material Component: </i>A spider of any size or kind. It can be dead, but must still have all eight legs.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-2">Dweomer of Transference</h3>

      <p>Evocation</p>

      <p><b>Level: </b>Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One willing psionic creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless)</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)</p>

      <p>
        With this spell, you form a radiating corona around the head of a psionic ally, then convert some of your spells
        into psionic power points. When you finish casting <i>dweomer of transference, </i>a red-orange glow surrounds
        the psionic creature’s head. For the duration of the spell, any spells cast at the subject don’t have their
        usual effect, instead converting themselves harmlessly into psionic energy that the subject can use as energy
        for psionic powers. You can cast any spell you like at the subject, even area spells, effect spells, and spells
        for whom the subject would ordinarily not be a legitimate target. The spells don’t do anything other than
        provide the subject with power points, but you must still cast them normally, obeying the component and range
        requirements listed in the description of each spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each spell you cast into the <i>dweomer of transference, </i>the psionic creature gets temporary power
        points, according to the following table. The transference isn’t perfectly efficient. The temporary power points
        acquired through a <i>dweomer of transference </i>dissipate after 1 hour if they haven’t already been spent.

      <h3 id="section-1-3">Glossolalia</h3>

      <p>Evocation [Sonic, Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Bard 2</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 60 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> Cone-shaped burst</p>

      <p><b>Duration: </b>Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial; see text</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        You utter shrieks of nonsense and gibberish that thinking creatures find distracting and confusing. The spell
        affects only creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher. Any such creatures within the spell’s area must
        succeed on Fortitude saves or be stunned for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores of 20 or higher), dazed
        for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores between 10 and 19), or shaken for 1 round (if they have
        Intelligence scores between 3 and 9). In addition, a creature within the spell’s area loses any psionic focus it
        might have had and takes a –4 penalty on Concentration checks for 1 round. These effects happen whether or not
        the creature succeeded on its save.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-4">Mental Pinnacle</h3>

      <p>Transmutation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sorcerer/wizard 6</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level</p>

      <p>
        For a brief time, you achieve the mental dominance of a powerful psion, able to lash out at enemies using only
        the power of your mind. Your revel in your new mental powers to the point that you disdain using spells, even in
        the form of effects from magic items. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and Wisdom, 3 power points
        per caster level, and access to the following powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Mind Thrust<b><sup>A</sup></b
        >: Deal 1d10 damage.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Ego Whip<b><sup>A</sup></b
        >: Deal 1d4 Cha damage and daze for 1 round.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Psionic Blast<b><sup>A</sup></b
        >: Stun creatures in 30-ft. cone for 1 round.
      </p>

      <p>• Id Insinuation: Swift tendrils of thought disrupt and confuse your target.</p>

      <p>
        • Psychic Crush<b><sup>A</sup></b
        >: Brutally crush subject’s mental essence, reducing subject to –1 hit points.
      </p>

      <p>
        You manifest the powers as a psion of your caster level does, creating displays as described in each power’s
        description. You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell
        completion magic items, just as if those spells were no longer on your class list. For the duration of this
        spell, you use magic items and psionic items as if you were a psion with only the five powers given above on
        your class list.
      </p>

      <p>Any unspent power points dissipate when the spell ends.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Material Component: </i>A <i>potion of fox’s cunning, </i>which you drink (its effect is overridden by the
        effect of this spell).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-5">Probe Thoughts</h3>

      <p>Divination [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Mind 6, Wiz/Sor 6</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One living creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates; see text</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        All the subject’s memories and knowledge are accessible to you, ranging from memories deep below the surface to
        those still easily called to mind. You can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the
        subject’s knowledge. You can also probe a sleeping subject, though the subject may make a Will save against the
        DC of the <i>probe thoughts </i>spell to wake after each question. Subjects who do not wish to be probed can
        attempt to move beyond the power’s range, unless somehow hindered. You pose the questions telepathically, and
        the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the target do not need to speak the
        same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to your
        questions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-6">Psychic Turmoil</h3>

      <p>Abjuration</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will partial; see text</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        With this spell, you create an invisible field that leeches away the power points of psionic characters standing
        within the emanation. Nonpsionic characters are unaffected.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the spell is cast and at the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, psionic creatures within the area
        of the <i>psychic turmoil </i>lose 1 power point per manifester level they have. Characters who succeed on a
        Will save when they first come into contact with the emanation lose only half as many power points (round down)
        each round. Characters get only one save attempt against any particular <i>psychic turmoil </i>effect, even if
        they leave the spell’s area and later return.
      </p>

      <p><i>Material Component: </i>Five playing cards, which are torn in half when the spell is cast.</p>

      <p>Abjuration</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7</p>

        psionic creature. The temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
      </p>

      <p>Divination [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Cleric 3, Mind 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>

      <p><b>Components: </b>V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 30 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> You and one willing creature within 30 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 10 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        You forge a telepathic bond with another creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher. The bond can be
        established only with a willing subject. You can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of
        language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it
        works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).
