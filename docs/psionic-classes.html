      <h3 id="section-0-1"><a href="psionic-classes.html#section-0-1">THE POWER POINT RESERVE</a></h3>

      <p>
        Psionic characters fuel their abilities through a pool, or reserve, of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>. Your power point reserve is
        equal to your base <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> gained from your class, bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from a high key ability score (see
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-0-2">Abilities and Manifesters</a>, below), and any additional bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from sources such as your character
        race and feat selections.
      </p>

      <h4>Multiclass Psionic Characters</h4>

      <p>
        If you have levels in more than one psionic class, you combine your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from each class to make up your
        reserve. You can use these <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> to manifest powers from any psionic class you have.
      </p>

      <p>
        While you maintain a single reserve of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from your class, race, and feat selections, you are still
        limited by the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> you have achieved with each power you know.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-2"><a href="psionic-classes.html#section-0-2">ABILITIES AND MANIFESTERS</a></h3>

      <p>
        The ability that your powers depend on—your key ability score as a manifester—is related to what <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>ic class
        (or classes) you have levels in: Intelligence (<a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>), Wisdom (<a href="psionic-classes.html#section-3">psychic warrior</a><a href="npc-classes.html#section-5"></a>), and Charisma (<a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>). The
        modifier for this ability is referred to as your key ability modifier. If your character’s key ability score is
        9 or lower, you can’t manifest powers from that psionic class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as a high Intelligence score grants bonus <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> to a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> and a high Wisdom score grants bonus <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> to
        a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a>, a character who manifests powers (psions, psychic warriors, and wilders) gains bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>
        according to his key ability score. Refer to Table: <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1-1">Ability Modifiers</a> and Bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>How To Determine Bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a>:</b> Your key ability score grants you additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points </a> equal to
        your key ability modifier × your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> x1/2. Table: <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1-1">Ability Modifiers</a> and Bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a> shows
        these calculations for class levels 1st through 20th and key <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> from 10 to 41.

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Psions are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light </a>
        crossbow, quarterstaff, and shortspear. They are not proficient with any type of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> or <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a>. <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor </a> does
        not, however, interfere with the manifestation of powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Power Points/Day: </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>’s ability to manifest powers is limited by the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> he has available.
        His base daily allotment of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> is given on Table: The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">Psion</a>. In addition, he receives bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table: <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1-1">Ability Modifiers </a> and Bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a>). His
        race may also provide bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, as may certain <a href="feats.html">feats </a> and items.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Discipline: </b>Every <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> must decide at 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> which <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>ic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> he will specialize in. Choosing
        a <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> provides a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> with access to the class skills associated with that <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline </a> (see above), as
        well as the powers restricted to that <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>. However, choosing a <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> also means that the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>
        cannot learn powers that are restricted to other disciplines. He can’t even use such powers by employing psionic
        items.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Known:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> begins play knowing three <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> powers of your choice. Each time he achieves a new
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, he unlocks the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a> of new powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Choose the powers known from the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> power list, or from the list of powers of your chosen <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>. You
        cannot choose powers from <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>s other than your chosen <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>. (<i>Exception: </i>The <a href="feats.html">feats</a> <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-23">Expanded Knowledge</a><a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5"></a> and <a href="epic-feats.html#section-4-33">Epic Expanded Knowledge</a><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-23"></a><a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5"></a> do allow a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> to learn powers from the lists of other disciplines or
        even other classes.) A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his

      </p>

      <p>The number of times a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> can manifest powers in a day is limited only by his daily <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.</p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way
        that some spellcasters prepare their <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>), though he must get a good night’s <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> each day to regain all his

        The Difficulty Class for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> against <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> powers is 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>’s Intelligence
        modifier. <b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> begins play with the ability to learn 1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> powers. As
        he attains higher levels, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> may gain the ability to master more complex powers.
      </p>

      <p>To learn or manifest a power, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feats:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> gains a bonus feat at 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, 5th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, 10th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, 15th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, and 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
        This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat.

      <h2 id="section-2"><a href="psionic-classes.html#section-2">PSIONIC DISCIPLINES</a></h2>

      <p>
        A <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> is one of six groupings of powers, each defined by a common theme. The six disciplines are
        clairsentience, metacreativity, psychokinesis, psychometabolism, psychoportation, and telepathy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Clairsentience:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> who chooses clairsentience is known as a seer. Seers can learn precognitive
        powers to <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-4">aid</a> their comrades in combat, as well as powers that permit them to <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-14">gather information</a> in many
        different ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Metacreativity:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> specializing in metacreativity is known as a shaper. This <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> includes
        powers that draw ectoplasm or matter from <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>, creating semisolid and solid items such as <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>,
        <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, or animated constructs to do battle at the shaper’s <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Psychokinesis:</b> Psions who specialize in psychokinesis are known as kineticists. They are the masters of
        powers that manipulate and transform matter and <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>. Kineticists can attack with devastating blasts of
        <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Psychometabolism: </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> who specializes in psychometabolism is known as an egoist. This <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>
        consists of powers that alter the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>’s psychobiology, or that of creatures near him. An egoist can both <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">heal</a>
        and transform himself into a fearsome <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-5">fighter</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Psychoportation: </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> who relies on psychoportation powers is known as a nomad. Nomads can wield
        powers that propel or displace objects in space or time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Telepathy:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> who chooses the <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> of telepathy is known as a telepath. He is the master of
        powers that allow mental contact and control of other sentient creatures. A telepath can deceive or destroy the
        minds of his enemies with ease.
      </p>

      <p>PSICRYSTALS</p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> is a fragment of a psionic character’s personality, brought into physical form and a semblance of
        life (via the <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-51">Psicrystal Affinity</a> feat). A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> appears as a crystalline construct about the size of a
        human hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because it is an extension of its creator’s personality, a character’s <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> is in some ways a part of him.
        That’s why, for example, a psionic character can manifest a personal <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> power on his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> even though
        normally he can manifest such a power only on himself.
      </p>

      <p>A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> is treated as a construct for the purposes of all effects that depend on its type.</p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> grants <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a> to its owner, as shown on the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">Psicrystal</a> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">Special Abilities</a> table below. In
        addition, a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> has a personality (being a fragment of the owner’s personality), which gives its owner a
        bonus on certain types of checks or <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, as given on the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">Psicrystal </a> Personalities table below. These
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a> and bonuses apply only when the owner and the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> are within 1 mile of each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">Psicrystal</a> abilities are based on the owner’s levels in <a href="psionic-classes.html">psionic classes</a>. <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a>s from other classes do not count
        toward the owner’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> for purposes of <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> can speak one language of its owner’s choice (so long as it is a language the owner knows). A
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> can understand all other languages known by its owner, but cannot speak them. This is a supernatural
        ability.
      </p>

      <p><b><a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">Psicrystal</a> Basics: </b>Use the statistics for a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>, but make the following changes.</p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">Saving Throws</a>: </i>A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> uses its owner’s base <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> bonuses and <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1-1">ability modifiers</a> on saves,
        though it doesn’t enjoy any other bonuses its owner might have (from magic items or <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, for example).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Abilities: </i>When its self-propulsion ability is not activated, a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> has no Strength score and no
        Dexterity score.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Skills: </i>A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> has the same skill ranks as its owner, except that it has a minimum of 4 ranks each

(Even if its owner has no ranks in these skills, a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal </a> has 4
        ranks in each.) A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> uses its own <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1-1">ability modifiers</a> on <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>.

        <b>Psicrystal Ability Descriptions:</b> All psicrystals have <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a> (or impart abilities to their
        owners) depending on the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the owner, as shown on the table above. <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-2">The abilities</a> on the table are
        cumulative.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Natural Armor Adj. (Ex): </i>This number noted here is an improvement to the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor </a> bonus
        (normally 0). It represents a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s preternatural durability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Intelligence Adj. (Ex): </i>Add this value to the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s Intelligence score. Psicrystals are as smart
        as people (though not necessarily as smart as smart people).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Alertness (Ex): </i>The presence of a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> sharpens its master’s senses. While a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> is within
        arm’s reach (adjacent to or in the same square as its owner), its owner gains the <a href="feats.html#section-3-4">Alertness</a> feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Improved Evasion (Ex): </i>If a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> for half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, it takes no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> if it makes a successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> and half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> even if the
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> fails.
      </p>

      <p><i>Personality (Ex): </i>Every <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> has a personality. See <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">Psicrystal</a> Personality, below.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Self-Propulsion (Su): </i>As a standard action, its owner can will a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> to form spidery, ectoplasmic
        legs that grant the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> a land <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> of 30 feet and a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">climb</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> of 20 feet. The legs fade into
        nothingness after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Share Powers (Su): </i>At the owner’s option, he can have any power (but not any psi-like ability) he
        manifests on himself also affect his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>. The <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> must be within 5 feet of him at the time of the
        manifestation to receive the benefit. If the power has a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> other than instantaneous, it stops affecting
        the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> if it moves farther than 5 feet away, and will not affect the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal </a> again, even if it
        returns to its owner before the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> expires.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, the owner can manifest a power with a target of “You” on his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> (as a touch <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range </a> power)
        instead of on himself. The owner and <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> cannot share powers if the powers normally do not affect
        creatures of the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s type (construct).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Sighted (Ex): </i>Although it has no physical sensory organs, a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> can telepathically sense its
        environment as well as a creature with normal <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35">vision</a> and hearing. <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">Darkness</a> (even supernatural <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>) is
        irrelevant, as are areas of supernatural <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-36">silence</a>, though a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> still can’t discern invisible or ethereal
        beings. A <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s sighted <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is 40 feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Telepathic Link (Su): </i>The owner has a telepathic link with his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> out to a distance of up to 1
        mile. The owner cannot see through the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically
        as if the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> were the target of a <i>mindlink </i>power manifested by the owner. For instance, a
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of the telepathic link between a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item
        or place that the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> does. For instance, if his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> has seen a room, the owner can <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-4">teleport</a> into
        that room as if he has seen it too.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Deliver Touch Powers (Su): </i>If the owner is 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher, his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> can deliver touch powers
        for him. If the owner and <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> are in contact at the time the owner manifests a touch power, he can
        designate his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> as the “toucher.” The <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> can then deliver the touch power just as the owner
        could. As usual, if the owner manifests another power before the touch is delivered, the touch power dissipates.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Telepathic Speech (Ex): </i>If the owner is 5th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher, the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> can communicate
        telepathically with any creature that has a language and is within 30 feet of the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>, while the
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> is also within 1 mile of the owner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Flight (Su): </i>If the owner is 9th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher, he can, as a standard action, will his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> to
        <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a> at a <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> of 50 feet (poor). The <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> drifts gently to the ground after one day (or sooner, if the
        owner desires).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Power <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">Resistance</a> (Ex): </i>If the owner is 11th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher, the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> gains <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> equal
        to the owner’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + 5. To affect the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> with a power, another manifester must get a result on a
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> check that equals or exceeds the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Sight Link (Sp): </i>If the owner is 13th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher, the character can remote view the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> (as
        if manifesting the <i>remote view </i>power) once per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Channel Power (Sp): </i>If the owner is 15th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher, he can manifest powers through the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>
        to a distance of up to 1 mile. The <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> is treated as the power’s originator, and all ranges are
        calculated from its location.
      </p>

      <p>
        When channeling a power through his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>, the owner manifests the power by paying its power point cost. He
        is still subject to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> and other hazards of manifesting a power, if applicable (for
        instance, he becomes visible when manifesting an offensive power if <i>invisible</i>, as does the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">Psicrystal</a> Personality (Ex):</b> Each <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> has a distinct personality, chosen by its owner at the time
        of its creation from among those given on the following table. At 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, its owner typically gets a feel for
        a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s personality only through occasional impulses, but as the owner increases in <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> the
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s personality becomes more pronounced. At higher levels, it is not uncommon for a <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> to
        constantly ply its owner with observations and advice, often severely slanted toward the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>’s particular
        worldview. The owner always sees a bit of himself in his <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a>, even if magnified and therefore distorted.

      <h4><a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">Class Features</a></h4>

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Soulknives are proficient with all simple <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, with their own mind
        blades, and with <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-2">armor and shields</a> (except tower shields).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Mind Blade (Su):</b> As a move action, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can create a semisolid blade composed of psychic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>
        distilled from his own mind. The blade is identical in all ways (except visually) to a short sword of a size
        appropriate for its wielder. For instance, a Medium <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> materializes a Medium mind blade that he can wield
        as a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> weapon, and the blade deals 1d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (crit 19–20/x2). Soulknives who are smaller or
        larger than Medium create mind blades identical to short swords appropriate for their size, with a corresponding
        change to the blade’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. The wielder of a mind blade gains the usual benefits to his <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>
        roll from a high Strength bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>); however, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can simply create another
        on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to
        throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-21">magic weapon</a> for the purpose of overcoming <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can use <a href="feats.html">feats</a> such as <a href="feats.html#section-3-77">Power Attack</a> or <a href="feats.html#section-3-15">Combat Expertise</a> in conjunction with the mind blade just as if
        it were a normal weapon. He can also choose mind blade for <a href="feats.html">feats</a> requiring a specific weapon choice, such as
        <a href="feats.html#section-3-109">Weapon Specialization</a>. Powers or <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that upgrade <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> can be used on a mind blade.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a>’s mind blade improves as the character gains higher <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s. At 4th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> and every four <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s
        thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> rolls (+2 at 8th
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, +3 at 12th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, +4 at 16th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, and +5 at 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a <i>null psionics field</i>), a
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a>
        maintains his mind blade for a number of rounds equal to his class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> before he needs to check again. On an
        unsuccessful attempt, the mind blade vanishes. As a move action on his turn, the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can attempt a new
        Will save to rematerialize his mind blade while he remains within the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> negating effect.
      </p>

      <p><b><a href="feats.html#section-3-108">Weapon Focus</a> (Mind Blade): </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> gains <a href="feats.html#section-3-108">Weapon Focus</a> (mind blade) as a bonus feat.</p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-79">Wild Talent</a>: </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> gains <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-79">Wild Talent</a> as a bonus feat. (This class feature provides the character
        with the psionic power he needs to materialize his mind blade, if he has no <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> otherwise.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Throw Mind Blade (Ex):</b> A soul knife of 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher can throw his mind blade as a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>d weapon
        with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> increment of 30 feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> of 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher can make
        a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special
        abilities (such as Knife to the Soul; see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Psychic Strike (Su):</b> As a move action, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> of 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher can imbue his mind blade with
        destructive psychic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the next living, nonmindless
        target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability).
        Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. (Unlike the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-3">rogue</a>’s sneak
        attack, the psychic strike is not precision <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>
        from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to
        mind-affecting effects.)
      </p>

      <p>
        A mind blade deals this extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> only once when this ability is called upon, but a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can imbue his
        mind blade with psychic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> again by taking another move action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> until it is used. Even
        if the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is
        still imbued with psychic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> when the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> next materializes it.
      </p>

      <p>
        At every four levels beyond 3rd (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), the extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a>’s psychic strike
        increases as shown on the Table above.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Free Draw (Su):</b> At 5th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action
        instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shape Mind Blade (Su):</b> At 5th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> gains the ability to change the form of his mind blade.
        As a fullround action, he can change his mind blade to replicate a longsword (<a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> 1d8 for a Medium weapon
        wielded as a one-handed weapon) or a bastard sword (<a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> 1d10 for a Medium weapon, but he must wield it as a
        two-handed weapon unless he knows the <a href="feats.html#section-3-32">Exotic Weapon Proficiency </a> (bastard sword) feat). If a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> shapes his
        mind blade into the form of a bastard sword and wields it two-handed, he adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus to
        his <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls, just like when using any other two-handed weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can split his mind blade into two identical short swords, suitable for fighting with
        a weapon in each hand. (The normal penalties for fighting with two <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> apply.) However, both mind blades
        have an enhancement bonus 1 lower than the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> would otherwise create with a single mind blade.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Mind Blade Enhancement (Su): </b>At 6th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He
        can add any one of the weapon <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a> on the table below that has an enhancement bonus value of +1.
      </p>

      <p>
        At every four levels beyond 6th (10th, 14th, and 18th), the value of the enhancement a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can add to his
        weapon improves to +2, +3, and +4, respectively. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can choose any combination of weapon special
        abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a>’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> materializes his mind blade (unless he
        decides to reassign its abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes,
        including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.

        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade. To do so, he must first spend

        numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment
        his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> against each opponent within reach. Each
        fragment functions identically to the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a>’s regular mind blade.
      </p>

      <p>
        When using bladewind, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other <a href="feats.html">feats</a> or abilities (such
        as the <a href="feats.html#section-3-13">Cleave</a> feat or the <i><a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-5">haste</a> </i>spell).
      </p>

      <p>The mind blade immediately reverts to its previous form after the bladewind attack.</p>

        choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (his choice) for extra <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a> of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. For each
        die of extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> he gives up, he deals 1 point of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the ability score he chooses. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> can
        combine extra <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a> of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> in any combination.

      <p>
        The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-4">soulknife</a> decides which ability score his psychic strike <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>s and the division of ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and
        extra <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a> of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> when he imbues his mind blade with the psychic strike <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>.

      <h4><a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">Class Features</a></h4>

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Wilders are proficient with all simple <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, with <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, and with
        shields (except tower shields).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Power Points/Day:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>’s ability to manifest powers is limited by the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> she has available.
        Her base daily allotment of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> is given on Table: The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">Wilder</a>. In addition, she receives bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table: <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1-1">Ability Modifiers </a> and Bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a>). Her race
        may also provide bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, as may certain <a href="feats.html">feats </a> and items.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Known:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> begins play knowing one <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> power of your choice. At every even-numbered class
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> after 1st, she unlocks the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a> of new powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Choose the powers known from the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> power list. (<i>Exception: </i>The <a href="feats.html">feats</a> <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-23">Expanded Knowledge</a><a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5"> </a> and Epic
        <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-23">Expanded Knowledge</a><a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5"></a> do allow a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> can manifest any
        power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than her <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>The total number of powers a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> can manifest in a day is limited only by her daily <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.</p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> simply knows her powers; they are ingrained in her mind. She does not need to prepare them (in the way
        that some spellcasters prepare their <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>), though she must get a good night’s <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> each day to regain all
        her spent <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Difficulty Class for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> against <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> powers is 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>’s Charisma
        modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> begins play with the ability to learn 1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> powers. As she
        attains higher levels, she may gain the ability to master more complex powers.
      </p>

      <p>To learn or manifest a power, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Wild Surge (Su)</b>: A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild surge when she
        manifests a power. During a wild surge, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> gains phenomenal psionic strength, but may <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm </a> herself by the
        reckless use of her power (see Psychic <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-62">Enervation</a>, below).
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> with that manifestation of the power. The <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> boost gives her the ability to
        augment her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point for this
        wild surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the power is
        effectively supplied by the wild surge.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a>-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> manifests with her wild surge.
      </p>

      <p>
        This improvement in <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> does not grant her any other benefits (<a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> abilities do not advance,
        she does not gain higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> class abilities, and so on).
      </p>

      <p>She cannot use the <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-48">Overchannel</a> psionic feat and invoke her wild surge at the same time.</p>

      <p>
        At 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> can choose to boost her <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> by two instead of one. At 7th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, she can
        boost her <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> by up to three; at 11th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, by up to four; at 15th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, by up to five; and at
        19th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, by up to six.
      </p>

      <p>
        In all cases, the wild surge effectively pays the extra power point cost that is normally required to augment
        the power; only the unaugmented power point cost is subtracted from the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>’s power point reserve.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Psychic Enervation (Ex):</b> Pushing oneself by invoking a wild surge is dangerous. Immediately following
        each wild surge, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> may be overcome by the strain of her effort. The chance of suffering psychic
        <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-62">enervation</a> is equal to 5% per <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> added with the wild surge.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> who is overcome by psychic <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-62">enervation</a> is dazed until the end of her next turn and loses a number of
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> equal to her <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Elude Touch (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>’s intuition supersedes her intellect, alerting her to
        danger from touch attacks (including <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-27">rays</a>). She gains a bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> against all touch attacks equal to
        her Charisma bonus; however, her touch AC can never exceed her <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> against normal attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Surging Euphoria (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, when a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> uses her wild surge ability, she gains a +1
        morale bonus on attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls, and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> for a number of rounds equal to the intensity of
        her wild surge.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> is overcome by psychic <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-62">enervation</a> following her wild surge, she does not gain the morale bonus for
        this use of her wild surge ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 12th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, the morale bonus on a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>’s attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls, and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> increases to +2. At
        20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, the bonus increases to +3.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Volatile Mind (Ex): </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>’s temperamental mind is hard to encompass with the <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> of telepathy.
        When any telepathy power is manifested on a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> of 5th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher, the manifester of the power must pay
        1 power point more than he otherwise would have spent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The extra cost is not a natural part of that power’s cost. It does not augment the power; it is simply a wasted
        power point. The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>’s volatile mind can force the manifester of the telepathy power to exceed the normal
        power point limit of 1 point per <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>. If the extra cost raises the telepathy power’s cost to more
        points than the manifester has remaining in his reserve, the power simply fails, and the manifester exhausts the
        rest of his <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 9th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> is increased to 2 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>. At 13th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, the penalty increases to 3 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>, and at 17th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> it increases to 4 power
        points.
      </p>

      <p>As a standard action, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> can choose to lower this effect for 1 round.</p>

      <h4><a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">Class Features</a></h4>

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Elocaters are proficient with all simple and martial <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and with <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>
        <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Known:</b> At every <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> indicated on the table, the character gains additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day
        and access to new powers as if she had also gained a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in whatever manifesting class she belonged to before
        she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have
        gained (bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, metapsionic or <a href="feats.html#section-2-2">item creation feats</a>, <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal </a> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, and so on). This
        essentially means that she adds the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> to the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of whatever manifesting class the character
        has, then determines <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, powers known, and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a>, she must decide to which class
        she adds the new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> for the purpose of determining <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, powers known, and
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Scorn Earth (Su):</b> At 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a>’s feet lift from the ground. From now on, she can <a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-77">float</a> a
        foot above the ground. Instead of walking she glides along, unconcerned with the hard earth or difficult
        terrain. While she remains within 1 foot of a flat surface of any solid or liquid, she can take normal actions
        and make normal attacks, and can move at her normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (she can even “<a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a>” at four times her normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>).
        However, at distances higher than 1 foot above any surface, her <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed </a> diminishes to 10 feet per round.
      </p>

      <p>
        While she remains within 1 foot of a surface, she can make melee and ranged attacks normally, but if she moves
        any higher, she incurs the penalties on melee and ranged attack rolls as if she were the subject of the
        <i>psionic <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-65">levitate</a> </i>power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-69">Sidestep Charge</a> (Ex): </b>At 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> gains <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-69">Sidestep Charge</a> as a bonus feat, even if she does
        not meet the <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a>. If the character already has this feat, she gains no benefit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Opportunistic Strike (Ex):</b> Beginning at 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a>’s hyperawareness of spatial relations
        gives her an instinctive view of the battlefield, which allows her to make a cunning attack against distracted
        opponents. The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> gains a +2 insight bonus on her <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> and her <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> roll (if the attack hits) for
        the first attack she makes against an opponent that has been dealt <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> in melee by another character since
        the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a>’s last action. At 5th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> the insight bonus increases to +4, and at 8th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> the insight bonus
        increases to +6.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Dimension Step (Su): </b>An <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> of 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher can slip psionically between spaces as if using
        the <i>psionic dimension door </i>power, once per day. The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> cannot bring any other creatures with her.
        Her <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> for this effect is equal to her <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Flanker (Ex):</b> An <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> of 4th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher can flank enemies from seemingly impossible angles. She
        can designate any adjacent square as the square from which <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-4">flanking</a> against an ally is determined (including the
        square where she stands, as normal). She can designate the square at the beginning of her turn or at any time
        during her turn. The designated square remains her effective square for <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-4">flanking </a> until she is no longer adjacent
        to it or until she chooses a different square (at the start of one of her turns). The character can even choose
        a square that is impassable or occupied.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Transporter (Ex): </b>At 6th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> learns both <i>psionic <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-4">teleport</a> </i>and
        <i>psionic <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-16">plane shift</a></i>. These powers are in addition to any powers the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> normally learns by advancing
        a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> treats these powers as if they were 3rd-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> powers on her class list. This means, among other
        things, that manifesting these powers costs 5 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>. (If the character does not have a high enough
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> to manifest 3rd-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> powers the character cannot manifest these powers until she has attained
        the required <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Capricious Step (Ex):</b> At 7th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> can take an extra 5-foot step in any round when she
        doesn’t <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> any other <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> (except for the first 5-foot step). Like the first, the second 5-foot step
        does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. The character can take the extra 5-foot step immediately after taking
        the first, or wait until the end of her other actions for the round. In all other ways, the rules for taking a
        5-foot step apply<i>.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Dimension <a href="feats.html#section-3-97">Spring Attack</a> (Su):</b> An <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> of 9th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher can use her dimension step ability in
        conjunction with her <a href="feats.html#section-3-97">Spring Attack</a> feat once per day. This ability can be used only against opponents within 60
        feet to which the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> has line of sight. She can dimension step up to the target, use <a href="feats.html#section-3-97">Spring Attack</a>, and
        then use dimension step to return to her starting point. (When she uses this ability, the total distance she can
        travel before and after the attack is not limited by her <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>.) The use of this ability counts as her use of
        the dimension step ability on that day (and this ability is not available during a day when she has already used
        dimension step).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Accelerated Action (Su):</b> When she attains 10th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> can accelerate herself and thereby take
        more actions than normal. An <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> can accelerate herself for a total of 5 rounds per day. She can choose to
        parcel out her accelerated actions in 1-round increments. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects
        that provide additional actions, such as <i><a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-12">schism</a> </i>or a <i><a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-5">haste</a> </i>spell—and in fact an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> can’t
        take an accelerated action if affected by these or similar effects.)
      </p>

      <p>
        If she makes a full attack while accelerated, an <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> can make one extra attack with any weapon she is
        holding. The attack is made using her full base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation.
        If the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> uses her accelerated action to move, she gains an enhancement bonus to her <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> of +30 feet.
        The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-8">elocater</a> can use her accelerated action to manifest a power, as long as she has not already manifested a
        power in the current round and the one she wants to manifest has a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-6">manifesting time</a> of 1 standard action or
        shorter. While accelerated, she gains a +2 <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saves and a +2 <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonus to
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>. Any condition that makes her lose her Dexterity bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> (if any) also makes her lose
        these <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonuses.

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> prestige class.</p>

      <p><b>Weapon and <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a> Proficiency:</b> Psionic Fists gain no proficiency with any weapon or <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Monk Abilities:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a>’s class levels stack with his <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-6">monk</a> levels for the purpose of determining
        his unarmed <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and bonuses to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> and unarmored <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. His class levels do not apply to other <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-6">monk</a>
        abilities such as flurry of blows, <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-42">slow</a> fall, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Power Points/Day:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> can manifest powers. His ability to manifest powers is limited by the
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> he has available. His base daily allotment of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> is given on Table: The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a>. In
        addition, he receives bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1-1">Ability Modifiers</a> and
        Bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a>). His race may also provide bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, as may certain <a href="feats.html">feats</a> and items. If a
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> has <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from a different class, those points are pooled together and usable to manifest
        powers from either class. Bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from having a high ability score can be gained only for the
        character’s highest psionic class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Known: </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> chooses his powers from the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-3">psychic warrior</a><a href="npc-classes.html#section-5"></a> power list. At 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> knows one <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-3">psychic warrior</a><a href="npc-classes.html#section-5"></a> power of your choice. Each time he attains a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, he learns one new
        power. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The total number of powers a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> can manifest per day is limited only by his daily <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the
        way that some spellcasters pre pare their <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>), though he must get a good night’s <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep </a> each day to regain
        all his spent <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Difficulty Class for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> against <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> powers is 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + the Psionic
        Fist’s Wisdom modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Maximum Power Level Known: </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> gains the ability to learn one 1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power when he takes
        his first <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in the prestige class. As he attains each new odd-numbered <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist </a> gains the
        ability to master more complex powers.
      </p>

      <p>To learn or manifest a power, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Psionic Feat:</b> At 5th and 10th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a> can take any psionic feat as a bonus feat. He
        must still meet the <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a> for the feat.

      <p><a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">Class Features</a></p>

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> prestige class.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Slayers are proficient with all simple and martial <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and with all
        types of <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Known:</b> Beginning at 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> gains additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day and access to new
        powers as if she had also gained a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in whatever manifesting class she belonged to before she added the
        prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus
        <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, metapsionic or <a href="feats.html#section-2-2">item creation feats</a>, <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, and so on). This essentially means that
        she adds the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> to the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power
        points per day, powers known, and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a>, she must decide to which class
        she adds the new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> for the purpose of determining <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, powers known, and
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the character did not belong to a manifesting class before taking this prestige class, she does not gain
        manifesting levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Favored Enemy (Ex):</b> When she enters the class, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> formally declares a type of psionic creature as
        the enemy she detests above all others. Due to her extensive study of her foes and training in the proper
        techniques for combating them, she gains a +2 bonus on <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a>, and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-18">Survival</a> checks
        when using these skills against her favored enemy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls against creatures of this kind. At 4th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> the bonuses
        increase to +4, at 7th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> to +6, and at 10th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> to +8.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Enemy Sense (Su):</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> can sense the presence of her favored enemy within 60 feet of herself, even if
        they are hidden by <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a> or <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-3">walls</a>, but she cannot discern their exact location.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Brain Nausea (Su):</b> At 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> gains a constant defensive ability somewhat similar to the
        <i>aversion </i>power. Any creature that attempts to eat the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a>’s brain must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 +
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a>’s class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) or become disinclined to do so for 24 hours thereafter. A creature that fails this save
        may take any action it desires except extracting the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a>’s brain (but does not realize it is being so
        affected). This ability is active even if the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Lucid Buffer (Ex):</b> At 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> becomes especially skilled at resisting mental attacks. She
        gains a +4 competence bonus on <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> against all compulsions and mind-affecting effects. This ability is
        active even if the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Cerebral Blind (Su): </b>After reaching 6th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> is protected from all devices, powers, and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>
        that reveal location. This ability protects against information gathering by clairsentience powers or effects
        that reveal location.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ability even foils <i>bend reality, limited <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a>, miracle, reality revision, </i>and <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> </i>when they
        are used to gain information about the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a>’s location (however, <i>metafaculty </i>can pierce this protective
        barrier). In the case of <i>remote viewing </i>or <i>scrying </i>that scans an area a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> is in, the effect
        works, but the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> simply isn’t detected. <i>Remote viewing </i>or <i>scrying </i>attempts that are targeted
        specifically at a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> do not work. This ability is active as long as the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> is psionically focused.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Breach Power Resistance (Su):</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> of 8th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher can enhance her weapon with psionic might.
        Each successful melee attack (or ranged attack if the target is within 30 feet) she makes with her weapon
        against a creature with <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> temporarily reduces its <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> by 1. Unless the creature is
        slain, its lost <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> returns all at once 12 hours later. This ability is active as long as the
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> is psionically focused.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Cerebral Immunity (Su):</b> On reaching 9th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> gains protection from all devices, powers, and
        <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that influence the mind. This ability shields her against almost all mind-affecting powers and effects
        (though the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> can selectively allow powers or <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> to affect her). The ability even foils
        <i>bend reality</i>, <i>limited <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a></i>, <i>miracle, reality revision</i>, and <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> </i>when they are used
        to mentally influence a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a>. This ability is active as long as the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> is psionically focused.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Blast Feedback (Su):</b> At 10th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, if a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-10">slayer</a> makes her <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> when attacked with
        <i>mind blast, </i>the <i>mind blast </i>rebounds upon the attacker. Only the original attacker is targeted in
        the rebound effect. If the original attacker fails a Will <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (DC equal to that of the original
        attack), the attacker is affected normally by the <i>mind blast.</i>

      <p><b>Weapon and <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a> Proficiency:</b> Metaminds gain no proficiency with any weapon or <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.</p>

        <b>Powers Known: </b>At every even-numbered <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-11">metamind</a> gains additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day and access
        to new powers as if he had also gained a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in whatever manifesting class he belonged to before he added the
        prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus
        <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, metapsionic or <a href="feats.html#section-2-2">item creation feats</a>, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-11">metamind</a>
        to the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, powers
        known, and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a character had more than one manifesting class before he became a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-11">metamind</a>, he must decide to which class he
        adds the new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-11">metamind</a> for the purpose of determining <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, powers known, and manifester
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.

        <b>Free Manifesting (Ps):</b> At 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-11">metamind</a> can manifest any 1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power he knows for free
        (without spending <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>) three times per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        At higher levels, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-11">metamind</a> gains the ability to freely manifest additional higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> powers: three
        2nd-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> powers per day at 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>; one 3rd-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power per day at 5th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>; one 4th-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power per day at

      </p>

      <p>
        This benefit applies only to the power point cost of an unaugmented power. Points spent to augment a power and
        an <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> (if any) must be paid as normal.

        seemingly endless <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> once per day, for up to 1 minute. His eyes shine like tiny stars, and faint
        illumination seems to beam out of his mouth and the end of each of his fingers. While so empowered, he can
        manifest any of his powers without drawing from his power point reserve. He finds the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> he needs
        welling up within his own body.

        If a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-11">metamind</a> using this ability enters a <a href="psionic-powers-g-p.html#section-0-29">metaconcert</a>, his power point reserve is accessed normally for the

      <h4><a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">Class Features</a></h4>

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> prestige class.</p>

      <p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">Psion</a> uncarnates gain no proficiency with any weapon or <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Known:</b> At every <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> indicated on Table: The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">Psion Uncarnate</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> gains additional
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day and access to new powers as if he had also gained a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in whatever manifesting class he
        belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that
        class would have gained (bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, metapsionic or <a href="feats.html#section-2-2">item creation feats</a>, <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal</a> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, and so
        on). This essentially means that he adds the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> to the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of whatever manifesting class
        the character has, then determines <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points </a> per day, powers known, and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a character had more than one manifesting class before he became a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a>, he must decide to which
        class he adds the new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> for the purpose of determining <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points </a> per day, powers
        known, and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Incorporeal Touch (Su):</b> Beginning at 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can make up to three melee touch
        attacks per day that each deal 1d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> if they hit. The character’s Strength modifier is not
        applied to this attack, but it is effective against incorporeal creatures (and against corporeal creatures while
        the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> is incorporeal) The character’s hand and arm seem to become slightly translucent when he
        makes these attacks. A miss still counts as a use of the ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        While uncarnate (see below), a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can make melee touch attacks at will that do not count against
        his uses of this ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        For every four levels higher than 1st the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> attains, the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on these attacks increases by 1d6
        points.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Uncarnate Armor (Su):</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> (or using <i>inertial armor </i>or a similar
        effect) gets his <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> bonus to AC even when he becomes incorporeal (see Shed Body, below). However, unlike
        other incorporeal creatures, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> does not gain a deflection bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class </a> from his Charisma
        modifier. This ability works even if the <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> being worn becomes incorporeal (such as through the use of the
        assume <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> ability described below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shed Body (Su):</b> Starting at 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can become incorporeal (or “uncarnate”) once per
        day as a standard action. The character can remain uncarnate for up to 1 minute. During this time, the
        character’s body fades into an immaterial form that retains the character’s basic likeness. While uncarnate, the
        character gains the incorporeal subtype (see below). He gains a <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> equal to his land <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (perfect
        maneuverability). His material <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> remains in place and continues to provide its <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> bonus to AC (see
        Uncarnate <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a>, above). His material <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> also remain corporeal. Losing his physical form allows the
        character to more easily access his mental abilities, and he gains a +1 bonus on all save DCs for powers he
        manifests while uncarnate.
      </p>

      <p>
        He can use <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> normally, deriving benefits from items that enhance his capabilities; however, all his
        <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> remains material even when the character is uncarnate (but see the assume <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> ability, described
        below).
      </p>

      <p>
        Often, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> appears almost like a <a href="monsters-g.html#section-4">ghost</a> wearing items of the material world. This doesn’t make his
        <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> more susceptible to attack (the normal rules for attended objects apply), but it does make it
        impossible for the character to enter or pass through solid objects while wearing solid <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>. If he drops
        his material <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>, he can pass through solid objects at will as described below.
      </p>

      <p>At 6th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> and higher, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can shed his body twice per day for up to 1 minute each time.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Incorporeal Subtype: </i>An incorporeal <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> has no physical body. He can be harmed only by other
        incorporeal creatures, magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> or creatures that strike as magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, spell-like
        abilities, or supernatural abilities. He is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or
        magic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, he has a 50% chance to ignore any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from a corporeal source (except for positive <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>,
        negative <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>, force effects<i>, </i>or attacks made with <i>ghost touch </i><a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        An incorporeal <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> has no natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> bonus—and, unlike other incorporeal creatures, does not gain
        a deflection bonus from his Charisma modifier. An incorporeal <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can enter or pass through solid
        objects (subject to the restrictions described in the shed body and assume <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> abilities), but must remain
        adjacent to the object’s exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than his
        own. He can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to his current location, but
        enemies have total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> that is inside an object.
        To see farther from the object he is in and attack normally, the incorporeal <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> must emerge. An
        incorporeal <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> inside an object has total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>, but when he attacks a creature outside the object
        he only has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at him as he attacks. An incorporeal
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> cannot pass through a force effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        An incorporeal <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a>’s attacks pass through (ignore) natural <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, and shields, although
        deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against him. He can pass through and operate in water as
        easily as he does in air. An incorporeal <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> cannot fall or take <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling </a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. He cannot make <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a>
        or <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> attacks, nor can he be tripped or grappled. In fact, he cannot take any physical action that would
        move or manipulate an opponent or its <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>, nor is he subject to such actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off <a href="traps.html">traps</a> that are triggered by weight. An incorporeal
        creature moves silently and cannot be heard with <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a> checks if it doesn’t <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> to be. It has no Strength
        score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attack rolls and its ranged attack rolls. Nonvisual
        senses, such as <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal
        creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> even when they
        cannot see.
      </p>

      <p><b>Assume Equipment (Su):</b> Beginning at 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a></p>

      <p>
        uncarnate can designate a number of pieces of his worn <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> (including <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> and <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>) equal to his
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> to become incorporeal when he uses his shed body ability. This has no effect on the
        <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>’s function, but now when the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> is incorporeal, he can enter or pass through solid
        objects while wearing nothing other than the designated <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>. Once designated, the <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> automatically
        changes to incorporeal when the character sheds his body, and it returns to corporeality when the character
        does. The character can change his designations as he desires.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Assume Likeness (Su):</b> At 4th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> and higher, while incorporeal, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can assume the
        likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
        opportunity. The character’s abilities do not change, but he appears to be the creature that he assumes the
        likeness of, allowing him the ability to effectively <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">disguise</a> himself and <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">bluff</a> those who might wonder at his
        true nature. Each physical interaction with a creature requires a successful <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check (opposed by the
        creature’s <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> check) to convince the creature of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a>’s new appearance. The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>
        uncarnate must not do anything to give away his true (incorporeal) nature in order for the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">bluff</a> to be
        successful; for instance, if he accepts an item from another creature only to have it fall through his
        immaterial hands, the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check automatically fails. However, a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check would be allowed if the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>
        uncarnate uses his <a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-32">telekinetic force</a> ability (see below) to hold the received item.
      </p>

      <p>
        When using his assume likeness ability, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> has an additional +10 circumstance bonus on <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">Disguise</a>
        checks. If he can read an opponent’s mind, he gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> and <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">Disguise</a> checks.

        <b><a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-32">Telekinetic Force</a> (Su):</b> Beginning at 7th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, while incorporeal, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can use a
        <a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-32">telekinetic force</a> effect as a standard action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. The save DC is equal
        to 14 + the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a>’s key ability modifier (either Int, Wis, or Cha). The character’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>
        is the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of the effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even while corporeal, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can use this ability, but only three times per day (uses while he is
        uncarnate do not count against this use limit).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Uncarnate Bridge (Su): </b>At 8th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, as a creature of almost pure mind, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> becomes more
        closely attuned to the minds of other creatures. He gains the ability to <a href="equipment.html#section-4-7">transport</a> himself via the minds of
        living creatures. Once per day as a standard action while incorporeal, he can seamlessly enter any living
        creature with an Intelligence score and pass to another living creature with an Intelligence score that is
        within line of sight of the first creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> must be in a space adjacent to the entry creature before transporting, and he appears in a
        space adjacent to the destination creature after transporting. The entry and destination creatures need not be
        familiar to the character. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> cannot use himself as the entry or destination creature. Neither
        creature need be a willing participant.
      </p>

      <p>
        When exiting the destination creature, the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> chooses an adjacent square in which to appear.
        Entering and leaving a creature is painless, unless the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> wishes otherwise (see below). In most
        cases, though, the destination creature finds being the endpoint of a mental bridge surprising and quite
        unsettling.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he desires, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> can destructively exit the destination creature. If the creature fails a Will
        save (DC 15 + <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a>’s key ability modifier), the exiting <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> tunes his mental form to
        destructively interfere with the target’s mind. He bursts forth explosively from the creature’s body, dealing it
        10d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Uncarnate (Ex):</b> At 10th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-12">psion uncarnate</a> becomes a being of pure psionic consciousness. This
        ability is similar to shed body, except the character is permanently incorporeal (and gains that subtype). If
        the character desires, he can become corporeal once per day for up to 1 minute, but he spends the rest of his
        time as an entity of mind untethered by the physical world.

      <p>
        <b><i>Fire Lash </i>(Ps):</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-13">pyrokineticist</a> gains the ability to fashion a 15-foot-long whip of fire from
        unstable ectoplasm as a move-equivalent action. She takes no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from a fire lash she creates, and if she
        releases her hold, it immediately dissipates. The lash deals 1d8 points of fire <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to a target within 15
        feet on a successful ranged touch attack. A pyro can take <a href="feats.html#section-3-108">Weapon Focus</a> and <a href="feats.html#section-3-109">Weapon Specialization</a> (if she
        otherwise meets the <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a>) in conjunction with the fire lash, as well as any <a href="feats.html">feats</a> that apply to the use
        of a standard whip. The whip remains in existence as long as the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-13">pyrokineticist</a> holds it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Fire Adaptation (Ex):</b> At 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-13">pyrokineticist</a> becomes resistant to fire, gaining a +4 bonus on all
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> against fire and heat <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and effects. In addition, she gains <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> to fire 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Hand Afire </i>(Ps):</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-13">pyrokineticist</a> of 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher can activate this ability as a
        move-equivalent action. Flames engulf one of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-13">pyrokineticist</a>’s hands (but do her no <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a>). Her unarmed
        attacks with that hand are treated as armed. Such attacks deal an extra 2d6 points of fire <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.

        projectile such as a stone, bullet, arrow, or <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-24">bolt</a>). The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of fire <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on a

        While she is aflame, the character’s Charisma score increases by 4, she can make a melee touch attack for 2d6
        points of fire <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, and she gains <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> 5/magic. If she is struck in melee, the attacker takes 2d6
        points of fire <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. This ability lasts for up to 1 minute per <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-13">pyrokineticist</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> and is usable once per
        day.

        (see the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> skill description) to literally walk on air. She moves at her normal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> in all

        leaves footprints of flame in the air that disperse in 2 rounds, but her tread does not deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. She must
        pay 1 power point per round spent traveling in this fashion.

      <h4><a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">Class Features</a></h4>

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> prestige class.</p>

      <p><b>Weapon and <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a> Proficiency:</b> Thrallherds gain no proficiency with any weapon or <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Known:</b> At every <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> from 2nd through 9th, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> gains additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day and
        access to new powers as if she had also gained a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in whatever manifesting class she belonged to before she
        added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have
        gained (bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, metapsionic or <a href="feats.html#section-2-2">item creation feats</a>, <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-30">psicrystal </a> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, and so on). This
        essentially means that she adds the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> to the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of whatever manifesting class the character
        has, then determines <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, powers known, and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a>, she must decide to which
        class she adds the new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> for the purpose of determining <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day, powers known,
        and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">Thrallherd</a> (Ex):</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> who has just entered the class sends out a subtle psychic call for
        servants, and that call is answered. Essentially, the character gains something akin to the <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership </a> feat, but
        with some important differences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those who answer a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a>’s call are not referred to as cohorts and followers, but rather as thralls and
        believers, respectively. They do not appear because they admire the character and want to serve her, but because
        a hidden psychic resonance connects the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> and her servants.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> feat, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> has a <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> score that determines the highest-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> thrall and
        believers she can attract. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a>’s <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> score is equal to her character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + her Cha modifier +
        her <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. (Note that her <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is counted twice.) This score is not affected by any of
        the modifiers mentioned in the <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> feat<i>.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        As with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> feat, the called thrall’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is limited, even if the character’s <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> score
        would indicate a higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> thrall. Unlike with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> feat, the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> limit of a thrall is equal to
        the character’s total <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> minus 1 (not <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> minus 2, as is true for cohorts).
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> cannot take the <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> feat; if the character already has it, the feat is lost and replaced by
        this ability; those who were previously cohorts and followers go their separate ways, and those who are more
        mentally pliable show up later to take up roles as thralls and believers. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a>’s first thrall and
        believers arrive within 24 hours of her entry into this class; likewise, lost thralls and believers are replaced
        within 24 hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use the following table instead of the one with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-63">Leadership</a> feat to determine the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a>’s
        thrall and the number of believers of various levels a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-14">thrallherd</a> can attract.

      <h4><a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">Class Features</a></h4>

      <p>All the following are <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> prestige class.</p>

      <p><b>Weapon and <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a> Proficiency:</b> War minds gain no proficiency with any weapon or <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Power Points/Day:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can manifest powers. His ability to manifest powers is limited by the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> he has available. His base daily allotment of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> is given on Table: The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">War Mind</a>. In addition,
        he receives bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day if he has a high Wisdom score. His race may also provide bonus power
        points per day, as may certain <a href="feats.html">feats</a> and items. If a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> has <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from a different class, those
        points are pooled together and usable to manifest powers from either class. Bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from having a
        high ability score can be gained only for the character’s highest psionic class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Known:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> chooses his powers from the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-3">psychic warrior</a><a href="npc-classes.html#section-5"></a> power list. At 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a>
        knows one <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-3">psychic warrior</a><a href="npc-classes.html#section-5"></a> power of your choice. At every even-numbered <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> higher than 1st, he learns one new
        power. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The total number of powers a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can manifest per day is limited only by his daily <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way
        that some spellcasters prepare their <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>), though he must get a good night’s <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep </a> each day to regain all his
        spent <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Difficulty Class for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> against <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> powers is 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a>’s Wisdom
        modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Maximum Power Level Known: </b>A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> gains the ability to learn one 1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power when he takes his
        first <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in the prestige class. As he attains each even-numbered <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> beyond 2nd, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> gains the
        ability to master more complex powers.
      </p>

      <p>To learn or manifest a power, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Chain of Personal Superiority (Ex):</b> At 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> learns the first principle of warfare for
        the individual combatant: the ability to both deal punishment and take it. Calling upon inner reserves of
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a> and dedication, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can provide himself with a +2 insight bonus to Strength and Constitution
        for up to 1 minute. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can use this power three times per day. Activating this power is a free action.
        At 7th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, the insight bonus to Strength and Constitution improves to +4.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Chain of Defensive Posture (Ex):</b> At 2nd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> learns the second principle of warfare for the
        individual combatant: the ability to avoid the enemy’s counterattacks if that enemy is not immediately
        overwhelmed. Calling upon inner reserves of <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a> and dedication, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can provide himself with a +2
        insight bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> for up to 1 minute. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can use this power three times per day. Activating
        this power is a free action. At 8th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, the insight bonus to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> improves to +4.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Enduring Body (Ex):</b> At 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> learns the third principle of warfare for the individual
        combatant: to unleash in oneself the spirit of the enduring body. The spirit of the ideal body transforms a war
        mind, granting him <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> 1/–. At 6th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, his <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> improves to 2/–. At 9th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, his
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> improves to 3/–.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Sweeping Strike (Ex):</b> At 5th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> gains the ability to make great, sweeping swings with a
        melee weapon. On each melee attack a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> makes, he can choose squares he threatens that are adjacent to
        each other, and his attacks apply to creatures in those two squares equally. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can use this ability on
        any attack, even an attack of opportunity or a <a href="feats.html#section-3-13">cleave</a> attempt.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> cannot use this ability if he has moved more than 10 feet since the end of his last turn. If a war
        mind drops one or both of his foes with a sweeping strike, he can attempt a <a href="feats.html#section-3-13">cleave</a> normally; however, he makes
        only one <a href="feats.html#section-3-13">cleave</a> attempt per sweeping strike, even if he drops more than one foe.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Chain of Overwhelming Force (Su):</b> At 10th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> learns the fourth principle of warfare for
        the individual combatant: to discover the underlying violence of the world and deliver it in a perfectly
        executed attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> taps into this underlying <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> and apply it to a single attack, dealing an extra 10d6 points of
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-15">war mind</a> can use this power once per day. Activating this power is a free action. If the attack
        misses, the power is wasted.
