      <h3 id="section-0-1">Call Lightning</h3>

      <p>Evocation [Electricity]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Drd 3</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Range: </b>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> One or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide,
        30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning
        flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell’s range (measured from
        your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However,
        each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may
        call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are outdoors and in a stormy area—a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a
        tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)—each bolt deals
        3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.
      </p>

      <p>This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-2">Call Lightning Storm</h3>

      <p>Evocation [Electricity]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Drd 5</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>

      <p>
        This spell functions like <i>call lightning</i>, except that each bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage
        (or 5d10 if created outdoors in a stormy area), and you may call a maximum of 15 bolts.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-3">Calm Animals</h3>

      <p>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Animal 1, Drd 1, Rgr 1</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> Animals within 30 ft. of each other</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates; see text</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with
        Intelligence scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no
        two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 +
        caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; other animals are
        not.
      </p>

      <p>
        The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend
        themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-4">Calm Emotions</h3>

      <p>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 2, Clr 2, Law 2</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range: </b>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> Creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but
        <i>calm emotions </i>can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected
        cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive
        action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as
        <i>bless, good hope, </i>and <i>rage, </i>as well as negating a bard’s ability to inspire courage or a
        barbarian’s rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the <i>confused </i>condition from all
        targets<i>. </i>While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect. When the
        <i>calm emotions </i>spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that
        its duration has not expired in the meantime.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-5">Cat’s Grace</h3>

      <p>Transmutation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 2, Drd 2, Rgr 2, Sor/Wiz 2</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> Creature touched</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates (harmless)</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus
        to Dexterity, adding the usual benefits to AC, Reflex saves, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier.
      </p>

      <p><i>Material Component: </i>A pinch of cat fur.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-6">Cat’s Grace, Mass</h3>

      <p>Transmutation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 6, Drd 6, Sor/Wiz 6</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>

      <p>This spell functions like <i>cat’s grace</i>, except that it affects multiple creatures.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-7">Cause Fear</h3>

      <p>Necromancy [Fear, Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 1, Clr 1, Death 1, Sor/Wiz 1</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One living creature with 5 or fewer HD</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1d4 rounds or 1 round; see text</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will partial</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        The affected creature becomes frightened. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is shaken for 1 round.
        Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are immune to this effect.
      </p>

      <p><i>Cause fear </i>counters and dispels <i>remove fear</i>.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-8">Chain Lightning</h3>

      <p>Evocation [Electricity]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Air 6, Sor/Wiz 6</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, F</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>

      <p>
        <b>Targets:</b> One primary target, plus one secondary target/level (each of which must be within 30 ft. of the
        primary target)
      </p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips.
        Unlike <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>chain lightning </i>strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to
        other targets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it
        strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The
        secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (rounded down).
      </p>

      <p>
        Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose secondary targets as you like, but
        they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can
        choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Focus: </i>A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; plus one silver pin for each of your
        caster levels.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-9">Changestaff</h3>

      <p>Transmutation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Drd 7</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, F</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> Your touched staff</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant
        the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff
        turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any
        spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control
        trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is
        destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is
        dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full
        strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Focus: </i>The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an
        ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).
      </p>

      <p>You cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during the shaping and carving of the staff.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-10">Chaos Hammer</h3>

      <p>Evocation [Chaotic]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Chaos 4</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range: </b>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 20-ft.-radius burst</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous (1d6 rounds); see text</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will partial; see text</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a multicolored explosion of
        leaping, ricocheting energy. Only lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of
        damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slows them for 1d6 rounds (see the
        <i>slow</i> spell). A successful Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed.
        Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-11">Charm Animal</h3>

      <p>Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Drd 1, Rgr 1</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One animal</p>

      <p>This spell functions like <i>charm person</i>, except that it affects a creature of the animal type.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-12">Charm Monster</h3>

      <p>Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 4</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One living creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> One day/level</p>

      <p>
        This spell functions like <i>charm person</i>, except that the effect is not restricted by creature type or
        size.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-13">Charm Monster, Mass</h3>

      <p>Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 8</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> One day/level</p>

      <p>
        This spell functions like <i>charm monster, </i>except that <i>mass charm monster </i>affects a number of
        creatures whose combined HD do not exceed twice your level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there
        are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you choose a creature with
        too many HD.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-14">Charm Person</h3>

      <p>Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One humanoid creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target’s attitude as
        friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives
        a +5 bonus on its saving throw.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell does not enable you to control the <i>charmed </i>person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives
        your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an
        opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An
        affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something
        very dangerous is worth doing.&nbsp; Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the
        <i>charmed </i>person breaks the spell. You must speak the person’s language to communicate your commands, or
        else be good at pantomiming.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-15">Chill Metal</h3>

      <p>Transmutation [Cold]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Drd 2</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p>
        <b>Target: </b>Metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or

        <i>Chill metal </i>makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal
        is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw
        bonus unless its own is higher.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it
        is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum
        damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it’s carrying
        weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The
        same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell’s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last)
        round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold,
        causing more damage, as shown on the table below.

        <i>Clairaudience/clairvoyance </i>creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to
        hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don’t need line of sight or line of effect, but the
        locale must be known—a place familiar to you or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor
        doesn’t move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells,
        this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale
        is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius around the
        center of the spell’s effect. <i>Clairaudience/clairvoyance </i>functions only on the plane of existence you are
        currently occupying.

      <p>
        This spell functions like <i>interposing hand, </i>except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or strike
        one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round.
        Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no
        better than yours.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or
        Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +11 for the hand’s Strength score (33), –1
        for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a
        Fortitude save (against this spell’s save DC) or be stunned for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is
        a move action.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>clenched fist </i>can also interpose itself as <i>interposing hand </i>does, or it can bull rush an
        opponent as <i>forceful hand </i>does, but at a +15 bonus on the Strength check.

        A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to
        spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become
        <i>confused. </i>This abjuration has four effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike
        <i>protection from law</i>, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by
        lawful creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful
        creatures.
      </p>

      <p>Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection from law </i>does.</p>

      <p>
        Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is
        <i>confused </i>for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the <i>confusion </i>spell, but against the save DC of
        <i>cloak of chaos</i>).

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul
        immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to
        return). The original’s physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be
        restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of
        natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.
      </p>

      <p>
        To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of
        at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature’s living body. The piece of flesh need not be
        fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for
        2d4 months.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the clone is completed, the original’s soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The
        clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original.
        In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss
        of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character). If this Constitution
        adjustment would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost
        levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone
        is one level below the level at which the original died.
      </p>

      <p>The spell duplicates only the original’s body and mind, not its equipment.</p>

      <p>
        A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the
        resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a <i>fog cloud, </i>except that its vapors are yellowish green
        and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living
        creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of
        Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).
      </p>

      <p>
        A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the
        cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding one’s breath doesn’t help, but creatures immune
        to poison are unaffected by the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike a <i>fog cloud</i>, the <i>cloudkill </i>moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the
        surface of the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        Figure out the cloud’s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away
        from the point of origin where you cast the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or
        sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

      <p>
        This spell allows you some degree of control over an undead creature. Assuming the subject is intelligent, it
        perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack
        you while the spell lasts. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to
        convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded undead
        never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is
        worth doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you
        can communicate only basic commands, such as “come here,” “go there,” “fight,” “stand still,” and so on.
        Nonintelligent undead won’t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence)
        breaks the spell.
      </p>

      <p>Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level</p>

      <p>
        You contact your deity—or agents thereof —and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A
        cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per
        caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity’s knowledge. “Unclear” is a
        legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a
        one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, a short phrase (five words or less)
        may be given as an answer instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their
        answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell
        ends.

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p>
        You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as
        many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water,
        people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or
        even the general state of the natural setting.
      </p>

      <p>
        In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground
        settings—caves, caverns, and the like—the radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not
        function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.

      <p>
        You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. In either
        case, you must touch the creature or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into
        the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not
        speak or write it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read,
        though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the
        <i>secret page </i>and <i>illusory script </i>spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed
        in otherwise normal text.

        This spell blesses an area with positive energy. Each Charisma check made to turn undead within this area gains
        a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a <i>consecrated </i>area suffers minor disruption, giving it
        a –1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a
        <i>consecrated </i>area.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the <i>consecrated </i>area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity,
        pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus on turning checks, –2
        penalties for undead in the area). You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than
        your own patron.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the area does contain an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power
        other than your patron, the <i>consecrate </i>spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the
        associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties
        relating to undead, as given above.

      <p>Divination</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration</p>

      <p>
        You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to
        receive advice and information from powers there. (See the accompanying table for possible consequences and
        results of the attempt.) The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give
        only brief answers to your questions. (All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,”
        “irrelevant,” or some other one-word answer.)
      </p>

      <p>
        You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one
        per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. For every two caster levels, you may ask
        one question.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease to
        Intelligence and Charisma, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the
        entity answering correctly, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results
        obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.)
      </p>

      <p>On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.</p>

      <p>Evocation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 6</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M, F</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> At least 10 minutes; see text</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> One day/level (D) or until discharged</p>

      <p>
        You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when
        casting <i>contingency</i>. The <i>contingency </i>spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The
        10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer
        than 10 minutes, use that instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell to be brought into effect by the <i>contingency </i>must be one that affects your person and be of a
        spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).
      </p>

      <p>
        The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases,
        the <i>contingency </i>immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast”
        instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed,
        the whole spell combination (<i>contingency </i>and the companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion
        spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can use only one <i>contingency </i>spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is
        dispelled.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Material Component: </i>That of the companion spell, plus quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage,
        rakshasa, or similar spell-using creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Focus: </i>A statuette of you carved from elephant ivory and decorated with gems (worth at least 1,500 gp).
        You must carry the focus for the <i>contingency </i>to work.

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like
        a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A <i>continual flame </i>can be covered and
        hidden but not smothered or quenched.
      </p>

      <p>Light spells counter and dispel darkness spells of an equal or lower level.</p>

      <p><i>Material Component: </i>You sprinkle ruby dust (worth 50 gp) on the item that is to carry the flame.</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> Up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant creatures for a short period of time. You
        command the creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal
        communication is impossible&nbsp; the controlled plants do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects
        revert to their normal behavior.
      </p>

      <p>Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        This spell enables you to command undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and
        they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible the controlled
        undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.
      </p>

      <p>Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them.</p>

      <p><i>Material Component: </i>A small piece of bone and a small piece of raw meat.</p>

      <p>Transmutation [Water]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Clr 4, Drd 4, Sor/Wiz 6, Water 4</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M/DF</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Area: </b>Water in a volume of 10 ft./level by 10 ft./level by 2 ft./level (S)</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 10 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None; see text</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>Depending on the version you choose, the <i>control water </i>spell raises or lowers water.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Lower Water: </i>This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster
        level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to
        caster level × 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell
        creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable
        to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based
        creatures, this spell acts as a <i>slow </i>spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Raise Water: </i>This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the
        <i>lower water </i>version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that
        the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the
        water can spill over onto dry land.
      </p>

      <p>
        With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Arcane Material Component: </i>A drop of water (for <i>raise water</i>) or a pinch of dust (for
        <i>lower water</i>).

        You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot
        control specific applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a
        tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes
        later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you
        use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later).
        Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.

      <p>
        <i>Control weather </i>can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as
        create them.

        You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner,
        increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell
        ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an “eye” of calm
        air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area
        to any cylindrical area less than your full limit.
      </p>

      <p><i>Wind Direction: </i>You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell’s area.</p>

      <p>• A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.</p>

      <p>
        • An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering
        upward before impinging on the eye in the center.
      </p>
      <p>
        • A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.

        created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by
        casting a <i>purify food and water </i>spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain
        water, and it doesn’t go bad as the food does.

        You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not

      <p>
        <i>Material Component: </i>A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The spell
        must be cast on a dead body. You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as
        small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large—possibly creating a downpour or
        filling many small receptacles.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note: </i>Conjuration spells can’t create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8
        pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        When you utter the spell of <i>creeping doom, </i>you call forth a mass of centipede swarms (one per two caster
        levels, to a maximum of ten swarms at 20th level), which need not appear adjacent to one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may summon the centipede swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. The swarms remain
        stationary, attacking any creatures in their area, unless you command the creeping doom to move (a standard
        action). As a standard action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any prey within 100 feet
        of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100
        feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but it can be commanded
        again if you move within 100 feet).

      <p>
        An invisible cone of despair causes great sadness in the subjects. Each affected creature takes a –2 penalty on

        opponent that you select.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>crushing hand </i>can grapple an opponent like <i>grasping hand </i>does. Its grapple bonus equals your
        caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer,
        respectively), +12 for the hand’s Strength score (35), +4 for being Large. The hand deals 2d6+12 points of
        damage (lethal, not nonlethal) on each successful grapple check against an opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>crushing hand </i>can also interpose itself as <i>interposing hand </i>does, or it can bull rush an
        opponent as <i>forceful hand </i>does, but at a +18 bonus.

      <p>Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.</p>

        point per caster level (maximum +5).
      </p>

      <p>
        Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An
        undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

      <p>
        Like other <i>cure </i>spells, <i>mass cure light wounds </i>deals damage to undead in its area rather than
