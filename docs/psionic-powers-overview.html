      <h1><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html">PSIONIC POWERS OVERVIEW</a></h1>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-3">Psionic powers</a> spring from sentient minds. Even an undead creature or a being that has no physical form can
        create a reserve of inner strength necessary to manifest powers, as long as it has an Intelligence score of at
        least 1. Vermin possessed of a hive mind ability are an exception to this rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        A psionic power is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic characters and creatures need not prepare their powers for
        use ahead of time. They either have sufficient <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> to manifest a power or they do not.
      </p>

      <p>
        A power is manifested when a psionic character pays its power point cost. Some <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">psionic creatures </a> automatically
        manifest powers, called <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">psi-like abilities</a>, without paying a power point cost. Other creatures pay <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>
        to manifest their powers, just as characters do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each power has a specific effect. A power known to a psionic character can be used whenever he or she has power
        points to pay for it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-1"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-1">MANIFESTING POWERS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Psionic characters and creatures manifest powers. Whether they cost <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> when manifest by a psionic
        character, or are manifested as <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">psi-like abilities</a>, powers’ effects remain the same. The process of manifesting
        a power is akin to casting a spell, but with significant differences.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-2"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-2">CHOOSING A POWER</a></h3>

      <p>
        First you must choose which power to manifest. You can select any power you know, provided you are capable of
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-1">manifesting powers</a> of that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or higher. To manifest a power, you must pay <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>, which count against
        your daily total. You can manifest the same power multiple times if you have points left to pay for it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-3"><a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">CONCENTRATION</a></h3>

      <p>
        To manifest a power, you must concentrate. If something threatens to interrupt your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration </a> while you’re
        manifesting a power, you must succeed on a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check or lose the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> without manifesting the
        power. The more distracting the interruption and the higher the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power that you are trying to
        manifest, the higher the DC. (Higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> powers require more mental effort.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Injury:</b> Getting hurt or being affected by hostile <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> while trying to manifest a power can break
        your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> and <a href="epic-spells.html#section-7-36">ruin</a> a power. If you take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> while trying to manifest a power, you must make a
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 10 + points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> taken + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power you’re manifesting). The
        interrupting event strikes during manifestation if it occurs between when you start and when you complete
        manifesting a power (for a power with a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-6">manifesting time</a> of 1 round or longer) or if it comes in response to
        your manifesting the power (such as an attack of opportunity provoked by the manifesting of the power or a
        contingent attack from a readied action).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are taking continuous <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> half the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is considered to take place while you are manifesting a
        power. You must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 10 + 1/2 the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> that the continuous source last dealt + the
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power you’re manifesting).
      </p>

      <p>
        If the last <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt was the last <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> that the effect could deal then the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is over, and it does not
        <a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-27">distract</a> you.
      </p>

      <p>Repeated <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> does not count as continuous <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Power:</b> If you are affected by a power while attempting to manifest a power of your own, you must make a
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check or lose the power you are manifesting. If the power affecting you deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, the
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> DC is 10 + points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power you’re manifesting. If the power interferes
        with you or distracts you in some other way, the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> DC is the power’s save DC + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the
        power you’re manifesting. For a power with no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>, it’s the DC that the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> would have
        if a save were allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Grappling or Pinned:</b> To manifest a power while grappling or pinned, you must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check
        (DC 20 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Vigorous Motion: </b>If you are riding on a moving <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>, taking a bouncy <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">ride</a> in a wagon, on a small boat in
        rough water, belowdecks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 10 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Violent Motion: </b>If you are on a galloping <a href="monsters-animals.html#section-21">horse</a>, taking a very rough <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">ride</a> in a wagon, on a small boat in
        rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you
        must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Violent <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">Weather</a>: </b>If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of
        the power you’re manifesting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> of the
        power you’re manifesting. In either case, you lose the power if you fail the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration </a> check. If the <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">weather</a>
        is caused by a power, use the rules in the Power subsection above.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Manifesting Powers on the Defensive:</b> If you want to manifest a power without provoking attacks of
        opportunity, you need to <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> and weave. You must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> of the power
        you’re manifesting) to succeed. You lose the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> without successful manifestation if you fail.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Entangled:</b> If you want to manifest a power while entangled in a net or while affected by a power with
        similar effects you must make a DC 15 <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check to manifest the power. You lose the power if you fail.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-4"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">MANIFESTER LEVEL</a></h3>

      <p>
        The variables of a power’s effect often depend on its <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>, which is equal to your psionic class
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. A power that can be augmented for additional effect is also limited by your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> (you can’t
        spend more <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> on a power than your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>). See Augment under <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">Descriptive Text</a>, below.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can manifest a power at a lower <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> than normal, but the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> must be high enough
        for you to manifest the power in question, and all <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>-dependent features must be based on the same manifester
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the event that a class feature or other special ability provides an adjustment to your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>, this
        adjustment applies not only to all effects based on <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> (such as <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, and augmentation
        potential) but also to your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> check to overcome your target’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> and to the
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-5"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-5">POWER FAILURE</a></h3>

      <p>
        If you try to manifest a power in <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> where the characteristics of the power (<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, area, and so on)
        cannot be made to conform, the manifestation fails and the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> are wasted.
      </p>

      <p>Powers also fail if your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> is broken (see <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a>, above).</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-6"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-6">THE POWER’S RESULT</a></h3>

      <p>
        Once you know which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those creatures have made
        successful <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> (if any were allowed), you can apply whatever results a power entails.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-7"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-7">SPECIAL POWER EFFECTS</a></h3>

      <p>Certain special features apply to all powers.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Attacks:</b> Some powers refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even those that don’t <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a>
        opponents, such as <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> and <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-2">bull rush</a>, are considered attacks. All powers that opponents can resist with
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, that deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, or that otherwise <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> or hamper subjects are considered attacks.
        <i>Astral construct </i>and similar powers are not considered attacks because the powers themselves don’t <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a>
        anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Types:</b> Many powers give creatures bonuses to <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, attacks, and other
        attributes. Each bonus has a type that indicates how the power grants the bonus. The important aspect of bonus
        types is that two bonuses of the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge </a> bonuses, most
        circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see Combining Psionic and Magical
        Effects, below). The same principle applies to penalties—a character taking two or more penalties of the same
        type applies only the worst one.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bringing Back the Dead:</b> Of all the <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-3">psionic powers</a>, only <i>reality revision </i>has the ability to
        restore slain characters to life. When a living creature dies, its soul departs the body, leaves the Material
        Plane, travels through <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If
        the creature did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. Bringing
        someone back from the dead means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Level Loss: </i>The passage from life to death and back again is a wrenching journey for a being’s soul.
        Consequently, any creature brought back to life usually loses one <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of experience. The character’s new
        experience point total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> and the minimum
        needed for the next one. If the character was 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of
        Constitution instead of losing a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. This <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-21">level loss</a> or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any mortal
        means, even the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> </i>or <i><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-37">miracle</a></i>. A revived character can regain a lost <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> by earning XP
        through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> at the time of death can regain lost points
        of Constitution by improving his or her Constitution score when he or she attains a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> that allows an ability
        score increase.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Preventing Revivif cation: </i>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be
        returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using a single manifestation of
        <i><a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-3">reality revision</a> </i>to restore the slain character to life.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Revivif cation Against One’s Will: </i>A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> to be. A soul
        knows the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a>, <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to
        return on that basis.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-8"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-8">COMBINING PSIONIC AND MAGICAL EFFECTS</a></h3>

      <p>
        The default rule for the interaction of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> and magic is simple: Powers interact with <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>
        interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal spell-like ability interacts with another spell or
        spell-like ability. This is known as <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Psionics–Magic Transparency:</b> Though not explicitly called out in the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2">spell descriptions</a> or magic item
        descriptions<i>, </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, spell-like abilities, and magic items that could potentially affect <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> do
        affect <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>.
      </p>

      <p>When the rule about <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency is in effect, it has the following ramifications.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> is effective against powers, using the same mechanics. Likewise, <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> is effective
        against <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, using the same mechanics as <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>. If a creature has one kind of <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a>, it is
        assumed to have the other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by different means.)
      </p>

      <p>
        All <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">dispel magic</a> have equal effect against powers of the same <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> using the same mechanics, and
        vice versa.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell <i>detect magic </i>detects powers, their number, and their strength and location within 3 rounds
        (though a <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a> check is necessary to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> the <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> of the psionic aura).
      </p>

      <p>Dead magic areas are also dead <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> areas.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Multiple Effects:</b> Powers or psionic effects usually work as described no matter how many other powers,
        psionic effects, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, or magical effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same recipient.
        Except in special cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell operates. Whenever a power has a
        specific effect on other powers or <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, the power description explains the effect (and vice versa for <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>
        that affect powers). Several other general rules apply when powers, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, magical effects, or psionic effects
        operate in the same place.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Stacking Effects:</b> Powers that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>,
        and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don’t
        stack even if they come from different powers, or one from a power and one from a spell. You use whichever bonus
        gives you the better result.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Different Bonus Types</i>: The bonuses or penalties from two different powers, or a power and a spell, stack
        if the effects are of different types. A bonus that isn’t named (just a “+2 bonus” rather than a “+2 insight
        bonus”) stacks with any bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths</i>: In cases when two or more similar or identical effects
        are operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one applies. If
        one power or spell is dispelled or its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> runs out, the other power or spell remains in effect (assuming
        its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> has not yet expired).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Same Effect with Differing Results</i>: The same power or spell can sometimes produce varying effects if
        applied to the same recipient more than once. The last effect in a series trumps the others. None of the
        previous <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or powers are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final
        spell or power in the series lasts.
      </p>

      <p><i>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </i>Sometimes, a power can render another power irrelevant.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Multiple Mental Control Effects</i>: Sometimes psionic or magical effects that establish mental control
        render one another irrelevant. Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act usually do not
        interfere with one another, though one may modify another. If a creature is under the control of two or more
        creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect
        allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must
        make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys.

        <b>Powers and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> with Opposite Effects:</b> Powers and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> with opposite effects apply normally, with all
        bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some powers and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells </a> negate or counter

      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-1">POWERS AND POWER POINTS</a></h2>

      <p>
        Psionic characters manifest powers, which involve the direct manipulation of personal mental <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>. These
        manipulations require natural talent and personal meditation. A psionic character’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> limits the number of
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> available to manifest powers. A psionic character’s relevant high score might allow him to gain
        extra <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>. He can manifest the same power more than once, but each manifestation subtracts <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>
        from his daily limit. Manifesting a power is an arduous mental task. To do so, a psionic character must have a
        key ability score of at least 10 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Daily Power Point Acquisition:</b> To regain used daily <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>, a psionic character must have a clear
        mind. To clear his mind, he must first <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> for 8 hours. The character does not have to slumber for every
        minute of the time, but he must refrain from <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, combat, <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-1">manifesting powers</a>, skill use, conversation, or
        any other demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each
        interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time he has to rest to clear his mind, and he must have at least
        1 hour of rest immediately prior to regaining lost <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>. If the character does not need to <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> for
        some reason, he still must have 8 hours of restful calm before regaining <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Recent Manifesting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</b> If a psionic character has manifested powers recently, the
        drain on his resources reduces his capacity to regain <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>. When he regains <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points </a> for the coming
        day, all <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> he has used within the last 8 hours count against his daily limit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Peaceful Environment: </b>To regain <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>, a psionic character must have enough peace, quiet, and
        comfort to allow for proper <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>. The psionic character’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but they
        must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. Exposure to inclement
        <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">weather</a> prevents the necessary <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a>, as does any injury or failed <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> the character might
        incur while concentrating on regaining <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Regaining <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a>:</b> Once the character has rested in a suitable environment, it takes only an act of
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> spanning 1 full round to regain all <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> of the psionic character’s daily limit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Death and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a>:</b> If a character dies, all daily <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> stored in his mind are wiped away. A
        potent effect (such as <i><a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-3">reality revision</a></i>) can recover the lost <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> when it recovers the

      <h3 id="section-1-1"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-1-1">ADDING POWERS</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">Psion</a>ic characters can learn new powers when they attain a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> can learn any power from the
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>/<a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> list and powers from his chosen <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>’s list. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> can learn any power from the
        <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>/<a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a> list. A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-3">psychic warrior</a><a href="npc-classes.html#section-5"></a> can learn any power from the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-3">psychic warrior</a><a href="npc-classes.html#section-5"></a> list.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Powers Gained at a New Level: </b>Psions and other psionic characters <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> a certain amount of personal
        meditation between adventures in an attempt to unlock latent mental abilities. Each time a psionic character
        attains a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, he or she learns additional powers according to his class description. Psions, psychic
        warriors, and wilders learn new powers of their choice in this fashion. These powers represent abilities
        unlocked from latency. The powers must be of levels the characters can manifest.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Independent Research:</b> A <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a> also can research a power independently, duplicating an existing power or
        creating an entirely new one. If characters are allowed to develop new powers, use these guidelines to handle
        the situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any kind of manifester can create a new power. The research involved requires access to a retreat conducive to
        uninterrupted meditation. Research involves an expenditure of 200 XP per week and takes one week per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of
        the power. At the end of that time, the character makes a <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a> check (DC 10 + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>). If that check
        succeeds, the character learns the new power if her research produced a viable power. If the check fails, the
        character must go through the research process again if she wants to keep trying.
      </p>

      <h4>Manifest an Unknown Power from Another’s Powers Known</h4>

      <p>
        A psionic character can attempt to manifest a power from a source other than his own <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge </a> (usually a power
        stone or another willing psionic character). To do so, the character must first make contact (a process similar
        to addressing a power stone, requiring a <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a> check against a DC of 15+ the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power to be
        manifested). A psionic character can make contact with only a willing psionic character or creature (unconscious
        creatures are considered willing, but not psionic characters under the effects of other immobilizing
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a>). Characters who can’t use <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">power stones</a> for any reason are also banned from attempting to manifest
        powers from the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a> of other psionic characters. Mental contact requires 1 full round of physical contact,
        which can provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. Once contact is achieved, the character becomes aware of all the
        powers stored in the power stone or all the powers the other character knows up to the highest <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of power
        the contactor knows himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, the psionic character must choose one of the powers and make a second <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a> check (DC 15 + the power’s
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) to see if he understands it. If the power is not on his class list, he automatically fails this check.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon successfully making contact with another willing psionic character or creature and learning what he can of
        one power in particular, the character can immediately attempt to manifest that power even if he doesn’t know it
        (and assuming he has <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> left for the day). He can attempt to manifest the power normally on his next
        turn, and he succeeds if he makes one additional <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a> check (DC 15 + the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>). He retains the
        ability to manifest the selected power for only 1 round. If he doesn’t manifest the power, fails the <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a>
        check, or manifests a different power, he loses his chance to manifest that power for the day.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-2"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-1-2">USING STORED POWER POINTS</a></h3>

      <p>
        A variety of <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> exist to store <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> for later use, in particular a storage device called a
        <i>cognizance crystal</i>. Regardless of what sort of item stores the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>, all psionic characters must
        follow strict rules when tapping stored <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>A Single Source: </b>When using <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from a storage item to manifest a power, a psionic character may
        not pay the power’s cost with <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from more than one source. He must either use an item, his own power
        point reserve, or some other discrete power point source to pay the manifestation cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Recharging: </b>Most power point storage devices allow psionic characters to “recharge” the item with their
        own <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>. Doing this depletes the character’s power point reserve on a 1-for-1 basis as if he had
        manifested a power; however, those <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> remain indefinitely stored. The opposite is not true—psionic
        characters may not use <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> stored in a storage item to replenish their own power point reserves.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2"><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">SPECIAL ABILITIES</a></h2>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">Psionic creatures</a> can create psionic effects without having levels in a psionic class (although they can take a
        psionic class to further enhance their abilities); such creatures have <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-2">the psionic subtype</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Characters using <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">dorjes</a>, <i>cognizance crystals, </i>and other <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> can also create psionic effects. In
        addition to existing spell-like and supernatural abilities, creatures can also have <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">psi-like abilities</a>. (Psionic
        creatures may also have extraordinary and natural abilities.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Psi-Like Abilities (Ps):</b> The manifestation of powers by a psionic character is considered a psi-like
        ability, as is the manifestation of powers by creatures without a psionic class (creatures with the psionic
        subtype, also simply called <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">psionic creatures</a>). Usually, a psionic creature’s psi-like ability works just like
        the power of that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a>. A few <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">psi-like abilities</a> are unique; these are explained in the text where they are
        described.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">Psi-like abilities</a> have no verbal, somatic, or material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>, nor do they require a focus or have an XP
        cost (even if the equivalent power has an XP cost). The user activates them mentally. <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor </a> never affects a
        psi-like ability’s use. A psi-like ability has a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-6">manifesting time</a> of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in
        the ability description. In all other ways, a psi-like ability functions just like a power. However, a psionic
        creature does not have to pay a psi-like ability’s power point cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">Psi-like abilities</a> are subject to <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> and to being dispelled by <i>dispel <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a></i>.

        not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not

        psionic cascade.
      </p>

      <p>
        A psionic cascade is a loss of control over psionic abilities. Using <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> becomes dangerous for a
        character infected by cascade flu, once the incubation period has <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> its course. Every time an afflicted
        character manifests a power, she must make a DC 16 <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check. On a failed check, a psionic cascade is
        triggered. The power operates normally, but during the following round, without the character’s volition, two
        additional powers she knows manifest randomly, and their power cost is deducted from the character’s reserve.
        During the next round, three additional powers manifest, and so on, until all the psionic character’s power
        points are drained. Powers with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of personal or touch always affect the diseased character. For other
        powers that affect targets, roll d%: On a 01–50 result, the power affects the diseased character, and 51–00
        indicates that the power targets other creatures in the vicinity. <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">Psionic creatures</a> (those that manifest their
        powers without paying points) cascade until all the powers they know have manifested at least twice.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with any <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a>, a psionic character who is injured or attacked by a creature carrying a <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a> or
        parasite, or who otherwise has contact with contaminated material, must make an immediate Fortitude save. On a
        success, the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a> fails to gain a foothold. On a failure, the character takes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> (or incurs the specified
        effect) after the incubation period. Once per day afterward, the afflicted character must make a successful
        Fortitude save to avoid repeating the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. Two successful <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> in a row indicate she has fought off
        the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-10">disease</a>.

      <p>
        <b>Disease, Cerebral Parasites:</b> Spread by contact with infected <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">psionic creatures</a>; contact; DC 15;

      </p>

      <p>
        Cerebral parasites are tiny organisms, undetectable to normal sight. An afflicted character may not even know he
        carries the parasites—until he discovers he has fewer <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> for the day than expected. <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">Psionic creatures</a>
        with cerebral parasites are limited to using each of their known powers only once per day (instead of freely
        manifesting them). See the note about diseases under Cascade Flu, above.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Negative Levels:</b> Psionic characters can gain negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s just like members of other character
        classes. A psionic character loses access to one power per negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> from the highest <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of power he can
        manifest; he also loses a number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> equal to the cost of that power. If two or more powers fit
        these criteria, the manifester decides which one becomes inaccessible. The lost power becomes available again as
        soon the negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is removed, providing the manifester is capable of using it at that time. Lost power
        points also return.

        Every power is associated with one of six <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>s. A <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> is a group of related powers that work in
        similar ways. Each of the disciplines is discussed below.
      </p>

      <h4>Clairsentience</h4>

      <p>
        Clairsentience powers enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to glimpse the immediate future and predict
        the far future, to find hidden objects, and to know what is normally unknowable.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the purpose of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency, clairsentience powers are equivalent to powers of the <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-48">divination</a>
        school (thus, creatures immune to <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-48">divination</a> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are also immune to clairsentience powers).
      </p>

      <p>
        Many clairsentience powers have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in the direction you look. The
        cone defines the area that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple rounds, you can
        often gain additional information, as noted in the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> for the power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-6">Scrying</a>:</b> A power of the <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-6">scrying</a> subdiscipline creates an invisible sensor that sends you information.
        Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This includes any
        powers or effects that target you, but not powers or effects that emanate from you. However, the sensor is
        treated as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus functions normally even if you have been
        blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or
        higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an
        active power. Lead sheeting or psionic protection blocks <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-6">scrying</a> powers, and you sense that the power is so
        blocked.
      </p>

      <h4>Metacreativity</h4>

      <p>
        Metacreativity powers create objects, creatures, or some form of matter. Creatures you create usually, but not
        always, obey your commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        A metacreativity power draws raw ectoplasm from <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a> to create an object or creature in the place
        the psionic character designates (subject to the limits noted above). Objects created in this fashion are as
        solid and durable as normal objects, despite their originally diaphanous substance. <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">Psionic creatures</a> created
        with metacreativity powers are considered constructs, not outsiders.
      </p>

      <p>
        A creature or object brought into being cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor can it appear
        floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of supporting it. The
        creature or object must appear within the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, but it does not have to remain within the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the purpose of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency, metacreativity powers are equivalent to powers of the
        conjuration school (thus, creatures immune to conjuration <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are also immune to metacreativity powers).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Creation:</b> A power of the creation subdiscipline creates an object or creature in the place the manifester
        designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the power has a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> other than instantaneous, psionic
        <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> holds the creation together, and when the power ends, the created creature or object vanishes without a
        trace, except for a thin film of glistening ectoplasm that quickly evaporates. If the power has an instantaneous
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, the created object or creature is merely assembled through <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>. It lasts indefinitely and does
        not depend on <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> for its existence.
      </p>

      <h4>Psychokinesis</h4>

      <p>
        Psychokinesis powers manipulate <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> or tap the power of the mind to produce a desired end. Many of these
        powers produce spectacular effects above and beyond the power’s standard <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a> (see <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">Display</a>, below), such as
        moving, melting, transforming, or blasting a target. Psychokinesis powers can deal large amounts of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the purpose of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency, psychokinesis powers are equivalent to powers of the evocation
        school (thus, creatures immune to evocation <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are also immune to psychokinesis powers).
      </p>

      <h4>Psychometabolism</h4>

      <p>Psychometabolism powers change the physical properties of some creature, thing, or condition.</p>

      <p>
        For the purpose of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>– magic transparency, psychometabolism powers are equivalent to powers of the
        transmutation school (thus, creatures immune to transmutation <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are also immune to psychometabolism
        powers).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">Healing</a>:</b> Psychometabolism powers of the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a> subdiscipline can remove <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from creatures. However,
        psionic <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a> usually falls short of divine magical <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a>, in direct comparisons.
      </p>

      <h4>Psychoportation</h4>

      <p>Psychoportation powers move the manifester, an object, or another creature through space and time.</p>

      <p>For the purpose of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency, psychoportation powers do not have an equivalent school.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Teleportation:</b> A power of the teleportation subdiscipline transports one or more creatures or objects a
        great distance. The most potent of these powers can cross planar boundaries. Usually the transportation is
        one-way (unless otherwise noted) and not dispellable. Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral
        Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.
      </p>

      <h4>Telepathy</h4>

      <p>Telepathy powers can spy on and affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.</p>

      <p>Most telepathy powers are mind-affecting.</p>

      <p>
        For the purpose of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency, telepathy powers are equivalent to powers of the enchantment
        school (thus, creatures resistant to enchantment <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are equally resistant to telepathy powers).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Charm:</b> A power of the charm subdiscipline changes the way the subject views you, typically making it see
        you as a good friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Compulsion:</b> A power of the compulsion subdiscipline forces the subject to act in some manner or changes
        the way her mind works. Some compulsion powers determine the subject’s actions or the effects on the subject,
        some allow you to determine the subject’s actions when you manifest them, and others give you ongoing control
        over the subject.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-3"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-3">[DESCRIPTOR]</a></h3>

      <p>
        Appearing on the same line as the <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> and subdiscipline (when applicable) is a descriptor that further
        categorizes the power in some way. Some powers have more than one descriptor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The descriptors that apply to powers are acid, cold, death, electricity, evil, fire, force, good,
        language-dependent, <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, mind-affecting, and sonic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the power interacts with other
        powers, with <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, with unusual creatures, with <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>A language-dependent power uses intelligible language as a medium.</p>

      <p>A mind-affecting power works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.</p>

      <h3 id="section-4-4"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">LEVEL</a></h3>

      <p>
        The next line of the power description gives a power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, a number between 1 and 9 that defines the power’s
        relative strength. This number is preceded by the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a> of the class whose members can manifest the power. If a
        power is part of a <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>’s list instead of the <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>’s general power list, this will be indicated by the
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a> of the <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>’s specialist. The specialists a power can be associated with include Egoist
        (psychometabolism), Kineticist (psychokinesis), Nomad (psychoportation), Seer (clairsentience), Shaper
        (metacreativity), and Telepath (telepathy).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-5"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">DISPLAY</a></h3>

      <p>
        When a power is manifested, a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a> may accompany the primary effect. This secondary effect may be auditory,
        material, mental, olfactory, or visual. No power’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a> is significant enough to create consequences for the
        <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-1">psionic creatures</a>, allies, or opponents during combat. The secondary effect for a power occurs only if the
        power’s description indicates it. If multiple powers with similar <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a>s are in effect simultaneously, the
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a>s do not necessary become more intense. Instead, the overall <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a> remains much the same, though with
        minute spikes in intensity. A <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a> check (DC 10 + 1 per additional power in use) reveals the exact number of
        simultaneous powers in play.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Dispense with Displays: </i>Despite the fact that almost every power has a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a>, a psionic character can
        always choose to manifest the power without the flashy accompaniment. To manifest a power without any <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a>
        (no matter how many displays it might have), a manifester must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of
        the power). This check is part of the action of manifesting the power. If the check is unsuccessful, the power
        manifests normally with its <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if a manifester manifests a power without a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a>, he is still subject to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> in
        appropriate circumstances. (Of course, another <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check can be made as normal to either manifest
        defensively or maintain the power if attacked.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Auditory: </b>A bass-pitched hum issues from the manifester’s vicinity or in the vicinity of the power’s
        subject (manifester’s choice), eerily akin to many deep-pitched voices. The sound grows in a second from hardly
        noticeable to as loud as a <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-33">shout</a> strident enough to be heard within 100 feet. At the manifester’s option, the
        instantaneous sound can be so soft that it can be heard only within 15 feet with a successful DC 10 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-6">Listen</a>
        check. Some powers describe unique auditory displays.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Material:</b> The subject or the area is briefly slicked with a translucent, shimmering substance. The
        glistening substance evaporates after 1 round regardless of the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>. Sophisticated psions recognize
        the material as ectoplasmic seepage from <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>; this substance is completely inert.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Mental:</b> A subtle chime <a href="magic-items-iii-potions-rings-and-rods.html#section-2">rings</a> once in the minds of creatures within 15 feet of either the manifester or
        the subject (at the manifester’s option). At the manifester’s option, the chime can ring continuously for the
        power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>. Some powers describe unique mental displays.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Olfactory:</b> An odd but familiar odor brings to mind a brief mental flash of a long-buried memory. The
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-30">scent</a> is difficult to pin down, and no two individuals ever describe it the same way. The odor originates from
        the manifester and spreads to a distance of 20 feet, then fades in less than a second (or lasts for the
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, at the manifester’s option).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Visual: </b>The manifester’s eyes burn like points of silver fire while the power remains in effect. A
        rainbow-flash of <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> sweeps away from the manifester to a distance of 5 feet and then dissipates, unless a
        unique visual <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a> is described. This is the case when the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">Display</a> entry includes “see text,” which means
        that a visual effect is described somewhere in the text of the power.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-6"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-6">MANIFESTING TIME</a></h3>

      <p>
        Most powers have a manifesing time of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a
        free action.
      </p>

      <p>
        A power that takes 1 round to manifest requires a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the
        beginning of your turn in the round after you began manifesting the power. You then act normally after the power
        is completed.
      </p>

      <p>
        A power that takes 1 minute to manifest comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of
        those 10 rounds, you are manifesting a power as a full-round action, as noted above for 1-round manifesting
        times). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points </a> are lost and the power fails.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you use a power that takes 1 round or longer to manifest, you must continue the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration </a> from the
        current round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration </a> before the
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-6">manifesting time</a> is complete, the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> are lost and the power fails.
      </p>

      <p>
        You make all pertinent decisions about a power (<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, target, area, effect, version, and so forth) when the
        power comes into effect.
      </p>

      <h4>New <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-2">Action Types</a></h4>

      <p>
        <b>Swift Action: </b>A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of
        effort and <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> than a free action. You can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> one swift action per turn without affecting your ability
        to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action. However, you can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> only a
        single swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action any time
        you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> or the activation of
        <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>; many characters (especially those who don’t use <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>) never have an opportunity to take a
        swift action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Manifesting a quickened power is a swift action. In addition, manifesting any power with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> of 1
        swift action is a swift action.
      </p>

      <p>Manifesting a power with a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-6">manifesting time</a> of 1 swift action does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Immediate Action:</b> Much like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount of time, but
        represents a larger expenditure of effort and <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> than a free action. However, unlike a swift action, an
        immediate action can be performed at any time—even if it’s not your turn. Using an immediate action on your turn
        is the same as using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another
        immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is
        not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your
        swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are currently flat-footed.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-7"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">RANGE</a></h3>

      <p>
        A power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">Range</a> entry of the power description.
        A power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is the maximum distance from you that the power’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum
        distance at which you can designate the power’s point of origin. If any portion of the area would extend beyond
        the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, that area is wasted. Standard ranges include the following.
      </p>

      <p><b>Personal: </b>The power affects only you.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Touch:</b> You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch power that deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> can score a
        critical hit just as a weapon can. A touch power threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals
        double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on a successful critical hit. Some touch powers<i> </i>allow you to touch multiple targets. You
        can touch as many willing targets as you can reach, but all targets of the spell must be touched in the same
        round that you manifest the power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Close: </b>The power reaches as far as 25 feet away from you. The maximum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> increases 5 feet for every
        two manifester levels you have.
      </p>

      <p><b>Medium: </b>The power reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Long: </b>The power reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">Range</a> Expressed in Feet:</b> Some powers have no standard <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> category, just a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> expressed in feet.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-8"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-8">AIMING A POWER</a></h3>

      <p>
        You must make some choice about whom the power is to affect or where the power’s effect is to originate,
        depending on the type of power. The next entry in a power description defines the power’s target (or targets),
        its effect, or its area, as appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Target or Targets: </b>Some powers<i> </i>have a target or targets. You manifest these powers on creatures or
        objects, as defined by the power itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must specifically
        choose that target. However, you do not have to select your target until you finish manifesting the power.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you manifest a targeted power on the wrong type of target the power has no effect. If the target of a power
        is yourself (the power description has a line that reads “Target: You”), you do not receive a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> and
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> does not apply. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a> and <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">Power Resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> lines are omitted from such powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some powers can be manifested only on willing targets. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that
        can be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or it isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are
        automatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is
        bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a> and
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">Power Resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> lines are usually omitted from such powers, since only willing subjects can be targeted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Effect:</b> Some powers, such as most metacreativity powers, create things rather than affect things that are
        already present. Unless otherwise noted in the power description, you must designate the location where these
        things are to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">Range</a> determines how far away an effect can appear,
        but if the effect is mobile, it can move regardless of the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> once created.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Ray: </i>Some effects are <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-27">rays</a>. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged
        touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an
        invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as you
        do with a targeted power. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> for the creature you’re aiming at.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a ray power has a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, it’s the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the
        ray itself persists.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a ray power deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray power threatens a
        critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on a successful critical hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Spread: </i>Some effects<i> </i>spread out from a point of origin (which may be a grid intersection, or may
        be the manifester) to a distance described in the power. The effect can extend around corners and into areas
        that you can’t see. Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the effect may take.
        When determining distance for spread effects, count around <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-3">walls</a>, not through them. As with <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, do not
        trace diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect (unless the effect is
        centered on you), but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>(S) Shapeable: </i>If an Effect line ends with “(S)” you can shape the power. A shaped effect can have no
        dimension smaller than 10 feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Area:</b> Some powers affect an area. Sometimes a power description specifies a specially defined area, but
        usually an area falls into one of the categories defined below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point where the power originates, but otherwise you usually
        don’t control which creatures or objects the power affects. The point of origin of a power that affects an area
        is always a grid intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a power, count
        out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining
        the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to
        the center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can count diagonally across a square, but every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far
        edge of a square is within the power’s area, anything within that square is within the power’s area. If the
        power’s area touches only the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected by the
        power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Burst, Emanation, or Spread: </i>Most powers that affect an area function as a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>, an emanation, or a
        spread. In each case, you select the power’s point of origin and measure its effect from that point. A <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>
        power affects whatever it catches in its area, even including creatures that you can’t see. It can’t affect
        creatures with total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners).
        The default shape for a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> effect is a sphere, but some <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> powers are specifically described as
        cone-shaped.
      </p>

      <p>A <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>’s area defines how far from the point of origin the power’s effect extends.</p>

      <p>
        An emanation power functions like a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> power, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point of
        origin for the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> of the power.
      </p>

      <p>
        A spread power spreads out like a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the power
        spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure the area the power effect fills by taking into account
        any turns the effect takes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Cone, Line, or Sphere: </i>Most powers that affect an area have a particular shape, such as a cone, line, or
        sphere. A cone-shaped power shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts
        from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see
        above), and thus won’t go around corners.
      </p>

      <p>
        A line-shaped power shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of
        your square and extends to the limit of its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A
        line-shaped power affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through or touches.
      </p>

      <p>
        A sphere-shaped power expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts,
        emanations, or spreads.
      </p>

      <p><i>Other: </i>A power can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Line of Effect:</b> A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a power can affect. A
        solid barrier cancels a line of effect, but it is not blocked by fog, <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>, and other factors that limit
        normal sight. You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you manifest a power on or to any space in
        which you <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> to create an effect. You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any power you
        manifest.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>, cone, or emanation power affects only an area, creatures, or objects to which it has line of effect
        from its origin (a spherical <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>’s center point, a cone-shaped <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>’s starting point, or an emanation’s point
        of origin). An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a power’s
        line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no longer considered
        a barrier for the purpose of determining a power’s line of effect.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-9"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">DURATION</a></h3>

      <p>A power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">Duration</a> line tells you how long the psionic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> of the power lasts.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Timed Durations:</b> Many durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment. When the
        time is up, the psionic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> sustaining the effect fades, and the power ends. If a power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> is
        variable it is rolled secretly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Instantaneous: </b>The psionic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> comes and goes the instant the power is manifested, though the
        consequences might be long-lasting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Permanent: </b>The <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> remains as long as the effect does. This means the power is vulnerable to
        <i><a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-22">dispel psionics</a><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26"></a></i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Concentration:</b> The power lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a power is a
        standard action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. Anything that could break your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> when
        manifesting a power can also break your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> while you’re maintaining one, causing the power to end.
        You can’t manifest a power while concentrating on another one. Some powers may last for a short time after you
        cease concentrating. In such a case, the power keeps going for the given length of time after you stop
        concentrating, but no longer. Otherwise, you must concentrate to maintain the power, but you can’t maintain it
        for more than a stated <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> in any event. If a target moves out of <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, the power reacts as if your
        <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> had been broken.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Subjects, Effects, and Areas:</b> If the power affects creatures directly the result travels with the
        subjects for the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>. If the power creates an effect, the effect lasts for the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>. The effect
        might move or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> ends. If the power
        affects an area then the power stays with that area for its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>. Creatures become subject to the power when
        they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Touch Powers and Holding the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">Charge</a>:</b> In most cases, if you don’t dis<a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> a touch power on the round you
        manifest it, you can hold the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> (postpone the dis<a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> of the power) indefinitely. You can make touch
        attacks round after round. If you touch anything with your hand while holding a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, the power discharges. If
        you manifest another power, the touch power dissipates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some touch powers<i> </i>allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the power. You can’t hold the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge </a> of
        such a power; you must touch all the targets of the power in the same round that you finish manifesting the
        power. You can touch one friend (or yourself) as a standard action or as many as six friends as a full round
        action.
      </p>

      <p><b>Discharge: </b>Occasionally a power lasts for a set <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> or until triggered or discharged.</p>

      <p>
        <b>(D) Dismissible:</b> If the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">Duration</a> line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the power at will. You must be
        within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of the power’s effect and must mentally will the <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-38">dismissal</a>, which causes the same <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display </a> as when
        you first manifested the power. Dismissing a power is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
        opportunity. A power that depends on <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not
        take an action or cause a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-5">display</a>, since all you have to do to end the power is to stop concentrating on your
        turn.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-10"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">SAVING THROW</a></h3>

      <p>
        Usually a harmful power allows a target to make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> to avoid some or all of the effect. The <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a> line in a power description defines which type of <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> the power allows and describes how saving
        throws against the power work.
      </p>

      <p><b>Negates:</b> The power has no effect on a subject that makes a successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Partial:</b> The power causes an effect on its subject, such as death. A successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> means that
        some lesser effect occurs (such as being dealt <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rather than being killed).
      </p>

      <p><b>Half:</b> The power deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, and a successful <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> halves the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> taken (round down).</p>

      <p><b>None: </b>No <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is allowed.</p>

      <p>
        <b>(object):</b> The power can be manifested on objects, which receive <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> only if they are psionic or
        if they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the power, in which case the
        object uses the creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> bonus unless its own bonus is greater. (This notation does not mean that
        a power can be manifested only on objects. Some powers of this sort can be manifested on creatures or objects.)
        A psionic item’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>(harmless):</b> The power is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving
        throw if it desires.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Saving Throw Difficulty Class:</b> A <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against your power has a DC 10 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power +
        your key ability modifier (Intelligence for a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-1">psion</a>, Wisdom for a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-3">psychic warrior</a><a href="npc-classes.html#section-5"></a>, or Charisma for a <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-5">wilder</a>). A
        power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> can vary depending on your class. Always use the power <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> applicable to your class.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Succeeding on a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a>:</b> A creature that successfully saves against a power that has no obvious
        physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack. Likewise,
        if a creature’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> succeeds against a targeted power you sense that the power has failed. You do not
        sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect and area powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Failing a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a> against Mind-Affecting Powers: </b>If you fail your save, you are unaware that you
        have been affected by a power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Automatic Failures and Successes:</b> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> is always a failure,
        and the power may deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to exposed items (see Items Surviving after a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a>, below). A natural 20
        (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Voluntarily Giving up a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a>:</b> A creature can voluntarily forego a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> and willingly
        accept a power’s result. Even a character with a special <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> can suppress this quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Items Surviving after a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">Saving Throw</a>:</b> Unless the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> for the power specifies otherwise, all
        items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a psionic attack. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on
        its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against the effect, however, an exposed item is <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a>ed (if the attack can <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> objects). Refer
        to Table: Items Affected by Psionic Attacks.

      <p>
        Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll randomly

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">Power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> is a special defensive ability. If your power is being resisted by a creature with <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a>, you must make a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> check (d20 + <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>) at least equal to the creature’s
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> for the power to affect that creature. The defender’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"> </a> functions like an <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a>
        Class against psionic attacks. <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">Spell resistance</a> is equivalent to <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> unless the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">Psionics</a> Is
        Different option is in use. Include any adjustments to your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> on this <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> check.

      <p>
        The <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">Power Resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> line and the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">descriptive text</a> of a power description tell you whether <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a>
        protects creatures from the power. In many cases, <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> applies only when a resistant creature is
        targeted by the power, not when a resistant creature encounters a power that is already in place.

      <p>
        The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> as they do for <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>. A
        creature with <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> must voluntarily lower the <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> (a standard action) to be affected by a
        power noted as <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-4">harm</a> less. In such a case, you do not need to make the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> check described above.

      <h3 id="section-4-12"><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">POWER POINTS</a></h3>

      <p>All powers have a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">Power Points</a> line, indicating the power’s cost.</p>

      <p>
        The psionic character class tables show how many <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> a character has access to each day, depending on
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A power’s cost is determined by its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, as shown below. Every power’s cost is noted in its description for
        ease of reference.

      <p>
        <b>Power Point Limit:</b> Some powers allow you to spend more than their base cost to achieve an improved
        effect, or augment the power. The maximum number of points you can spend on a power (for any reason) is equal to
        your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>XP Cost (XP):</b> On the same line that the power point cost of a power is indicated, the power’s <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a>, if any, is noted. Particularly powerful effects entail an <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> to you. No spell or
        power can restore XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, so you cannot
        manifest a power with an XP cost unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you can, on gaining enough XP to
        attain a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, use those XP for manifesting a power rather than keeping them and advancing a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The XP
        are expended when you manifest the power, whether or not the manifestation succeeds.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-13"><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-12">DESCRIPTIVE TEXT</a></h3>

      <p>
        This portion of a power description details what the power does and how it works. If one of the previous lines
        in the description included “see text,” this is where the explanation is found. If the power you’re reading
        about is based on another power you might have to refer to a different power for the “see text” information. If
        a power is the equivalent of a spell an entry of “see spell text” directs you to the appropriate spell
        description<i>.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> Many powers have variable effects based on the number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> you spend when you
        manifest them. The more points spent, the more powerful the manifestation. How this extra expenditure affects a
        power is specific to the power. Some augmentations allow you to increase the number of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a>, while others
        extend a power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> or modify a power in unique ways. Each power that can be augmented includes an entry
        giving how many <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> it costs to augment and the effects of doing so. However, you can spend only a
        total number of points on a power equal to your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Augmenting a power takes place as part of another action (manifesting a power). Unless otherwise noted in the
        Augment section of an individual power description, you can augment a power only at the time you manifest it.
