      <h1><a href="psionic-items.html">PSIONIC ITEMS</a></h1>

      <h3 id="section-0-1"><a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-1">USING ITEMS</a></h3>

      <p>
        To use a psionic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation is accomplished simply by picking up
        an item or putting it on. Some items, once they are carried or worn, function constantly. In most cases, using
        an item requires a standard action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. By contrast, power completion
        items (see below) are treated just like powers in combat and do provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. The manifesting
        time of a power is the time required to activate the same power in an item, whether it’s a power stone, a dorje,
        or a psionic tattoo, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>The four ways to activate <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> are described below.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Power Completion:</b> This is the activation method for <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">power stones</a>. A power stone holds a power that is
        mostly finished. All that’s left to do is <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> the short, simple, finishing parts of the manifestation (the
        final mental coda, as it were). To use a power completion item safely, a character must be of high enough <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>
        in the appropriate class to manifest the power already. If he can’t already manifest the power, there’s a chance
        he’ll make a mistake (see Brainburn in the power stone description). Activating a power completion item is a
        standard action and provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> exactly as manifesting a power does.
      </p>

      <p>
        Powers stored in power completion items are usually not augmented, because the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of such an item
        is assumed to be the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an item’s description may specify
        otherwise (some <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">power stones</a> have manifester levels higher than the minimum required to manifest the stored
        power, and are then assumed to be augmented as well).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Power Trigger:</b> This is the activation method for <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">dorjes</a> and <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">psicrowns</a>. It requires the special <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a>
        of power manifestation that a character of the appropriate class would know, and the formation of the
        appropriate <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought. If a power is on a character’s power list, the character knows how to use a power
        trigger item that stores that power. The user must still determine what power is stored in the item before she
        can activate it. Activating a power trigger item is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
        opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Powers stored in power trigger items are not augmented. Such powers are assumed to be stored in the item at the
        minimum <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may specify a higher <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> than necessary. If such an item holds a power that deals hit point <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, the power is assumed to be
        augmented to the maximum allowed by the power and the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Command Thought:</b> If no activation method is suggested either in the psionic item description or by the
        nature of the item, assume that a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought is needed to activate it. <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">Command</a> thought activation means
        that a character mentally projects a thought, and the item activates. No other special <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a> is needed.
        Activating a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought psionic item is a standard action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes the <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought to activate an item is mentally imprinted within it and is whispered into the mind
        of a creature who picks it up. Other items are silent, but a <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-3">Knowledge (psionics)</a> or <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">Knowledge</a> (history) check
        might be useful in helping to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with the
        <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought in this case. The power <i>psionic <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify </a> </i>reveals <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Powers stored in <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought items are usually not augmented, because the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of such an item
        is assumed to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Use-Activated: </b>This type of psionic item simply has to be used to activate. Use activation is generally
        straightforward and self-explanatory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Some items made for wearing must still be
        activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought (see above), usually it means mentally
        willing the activation to happen&nbsp; (a free action). The description of an item states whether a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a>
        thought is needed in such a case.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic item is either a standard action or not an action at
        all and does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use
        activation is a standard action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time, use
        activation is not an action at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at
        least guess) what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes
        automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not augmented, because the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of such an item is
        assumed to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-2"><a href="psionic-items.html#section-0-2">SAVING THROWS AGAINST PSIONIC ITEM POWERS</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-items.html">Psionic items</a> produce <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-3">psionic powers</a>. The DC of a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against a power from a psionic item is always 10
        + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to manifest that
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of power.
      </p>

      <p>Another way to figure the same number is to multiply the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> by 1-1/2 and add 10 to the result.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">Psicrowns</a> are an exception to the rule. Treat the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> as if the wielder manifested the power, including
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> and all modifiers to save DC.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> take advantage of the fact that powers can be augmented to increase their <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> DCs.
        These items are special and have their cost to create and <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-0-4">market price</a> calculated using the manifester’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>
        instead of the power’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most item descriptions give <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact
        power equivalent (making its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> otherwise difficult to quickly determine).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-3"><a href="psionic-items.html#section-0-3">DAMAGING PSIONIC ITEMS</a><a href="psionic-items.html"></a></h3>

      <p>
        A psionic item doesn’t need to make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the
        effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. <a href="psionic-items.html">Psionic items</a> should always get a save against
        powers or <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that might deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to them—even against attacks from which a mundane item would normally
        get no chance to save. All types of psionic item saves—Fortitude, Reflex, and Will—are calculated the same way:
        The item’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> bonus equals 2 + 1/2 its <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> (round down). The only exceptions to this rule
        are intelligent <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.
      </p>

      <p>
        A psionic item, unless otherwise noted, takes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as a normal item of the same type. A damaged psionic item
        continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its psionic power is lost.
      </p>

      <p>REPAIRING ITEMS</p>

      <p>
        Some <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> (especially psionic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and shields) may take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> over the course of an adventure. It
        costs no more to repair a psionic item with the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-7">Craft</a> skill than it does to repair its nonpsionic counterpart.
        The <i><a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-25">make whole</a> </i>spell can repair a damaged—but not completely broken— psionic item.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-4"><a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-7">INTELLIGENT ITEMS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Some <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>, particularly <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> (as
        opposed to those that are single-use items, those that have charges, or those that store <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>) can be
        intelligent. (This means that <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a>, <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">power stones</a>, and <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">dorjes</a>, among other items, are never
        intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> have intelligence.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-5"><a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-8">CURSED ITEMS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Some <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> are cursed—incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-8">Cursed items</a> might be
        particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor f law, an inconvenient
        requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-6"><a href="psionic-items.html#section-0-6">CHARGES AND MULTIPLE USES</a></h3>

      <p>
        Some items are limited in power by the number of charges they hold or the number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points </a> they contain.
        Normally, charged items (such as <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">dorjes</a>) have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a
        <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a>, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1).
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, items that contain <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> (such as <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">psicrowns</a>) have a number of points equal to 50 × the
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of the creator. If such an item is found as a random part of a <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a>, roll d% and divide by
        2 to determine the number by which the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> is multiplied (round down, minimum 1).
      </p>

      <p>
        Market prices given on the tables are always for fully charged or fully powered items. (When an item is created,
        it is fully charged or fully powered.) For an item that’s worthless when its charges or <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> out
        (which is the case for almost all charged or powered items), the value of the partially used item is
        proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only
        part of the item’s value is based on the number of charges left.
      </p>

      <p>Some items are single-use and expendable. Such items can often be found in sets or groups.</p>

      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="psionic-items.html#section-1">PSIONIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS</a></h2>

      <p>
        In the following sections, each type of psionic item, such as <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> or <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a>, has a general
        description, followed by descriptions of specific items.
      </p>

      <p>
        General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other information. The <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>,
        hardness, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, and break DC are given for typical examples of some types of <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>. The <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> assumes that the item is unattended and includes a –5 penalty for the item’s effective Dexterity of 0. If
        a creature holds the item, use the creature’s Dexterity modifier as an adjustment to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> in place of the
        –5 penalty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some individual items, notably those that simply store <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-3">psionic powers</a>, don’t get full-blown descriptions. Simply
        reference the power’s description. Assume that the power is manifested at the minimum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> required to manifest
        it, unless otherwise noted. Increasing the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> so increases the cost of the item; see Table:
        Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Value,<i> </i>substituting “spell” for “power” and “<a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a>” for
        “<a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>” as appropriate. The main reason to make the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> higher, or course, would be to
        increase the potency of the power. Raising the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> is common for powers such as
        <i>astral construct</i>, the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> of which increases with the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the manifester.
      </p>

      <p>
        Items with full descriptions have their abilities detailed, and each of the following aspects of these items is
        summarized at the end of the description.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Aura:</b> Most of the time, a <i>detect <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> </i>power will reveal the <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> associated with a
        psionic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the
        beginning of the item’s notational entry in the form of a phrase. See the <i><a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-11">detect psionics</a><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26"></a> </i>power
        description for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Manifester Level:</b> The next entry in the summary indicates the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the creator (or the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of the powers placed within the item, if this <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is lower than the actual <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the creator). The
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> provides the item’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> bonus, as well as <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> and other <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>-dependent aspects of
        the powers of the item (if variable).
      </p>

      <p>
        It also determines the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a
        <i><a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-22">dispel psionics</a><a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26"></a> </i>power or a similar situation. This information is given in the form “ML x,” where “ML” is
        an abbreviation for manifester
      </p>

      <p><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> and “x” is an ordinal number representing the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> itself.</p>

      <p>
        For <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a>, <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">power stones</a>, and <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">dorjes</a>, the creator can set the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of an item at any number
        high enough to manifest the stored power and not higher than her own <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>. For other <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>,
        the item itself determines the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>. In this case, the creator’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> must be as high as
        the item’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> (and <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a> may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="feats.html#section-1">Prerequisites</a>:</b> Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a psionic item. These
        include <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, powers, and <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3">miscellaneous</a> requirements such as <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, and race or kind. The
        <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a> for creation of an item are given in the summary immediately following the item’s manifester
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A power prerequisite can be provided by a character who knows the power, or through the use of a power
        completion or power trigger psionic item or a psi-like ability that produces the desired power effect. For each
        day that passes during the creation process, the creator must expend one power completion item (such as a power
        stone) or 1 <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> from a power trigger item (such as a dorje), if either of those objects is used to supply a
        prerequisite.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant
        providing one or more of the <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a>. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary, such as if one
        character knows some of the powers necessary to create an item and another character knows the rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered
        the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> must be known. (It’s sensible, although
        not mandatory, for the highest-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> character involved to be considered the creator.) The character designated
        as the creator pays the experience points required to make the item.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically, a list of <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a> includes one feat and one or more powers (or some other requirement in
        addition to the feat). When two powers at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those powers is
        required in addition to every other power mentioned prior to the last two.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Market Price:</b> This gold piece value, given in the summary following the word “Price,” represents the
        price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-0-4">Market price</a>s are also included on the random generation
        tables for easy reference. The <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-0-4">market price</a> of an item that can be constructed with a psionic item creation feat
        is usually equal to the base price + the price for any <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> (<a href="special-materials.html">special materials </a> or experience point
        expenditure).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Cost to Create:</b> The cost in gold pieces and experience points to create the item is given in the summary
        following the word “Cost.” This information appears only for items with <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components </a> (material or experience
        points) that make their <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-0-4">market price</a>s higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs
        derived from the base cost plus the cost of the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>. Items without <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> do not have a “Cost” entry.
        For them, the <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-0-4">market price</a> and base price are the same. The cost in gold pieces is 1/2 the <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-0-4">market price</a>, and the
        cost in experience points is 1/25 the <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-0-4">market price</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Weight: </b>The notational entry for many items ends with a value for the item’s weight. When a weight figure
        is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for the purpose of determining how much of a load a character
        can carry).

      <p>
        In general, psionic <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-2">armor and shields</a> follow the rules for the equivalent magic items, as far as enhancement
        bonuses, stacking, and other base abilities are concerned. An enhancement bonus is treated the same way
        regardless of whether magic or <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> created it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Psionic <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-2">armor and shields</a> differ from standard and magical equivalents in that psionic <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-2">armor and shields</a>
        incorporate one or more crystals into their <a href="monsters-g.html#section-12-2">construction</a>. Particularly powerful <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-2">armor and shields</a> may be
        entirely composed of brightly hued or transparent crystals.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special Qualities:</b> Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the item is intelligent, an 02–31 result indicates
        that the <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought (if any) is psionically imprinted and whispers itself into the user’s mind on
        acquisition, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities.

        <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> in their design. Most possess some crystal <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>, and some are composed entirely of crystal. Many

        In addition to enhancement bonuses, psionic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> can also have the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a> detailed here. A weapon

        to generate <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> (though some may be mentally audible; see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Mentally Audible:</b> Fully 30% of psionic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> telepathically mutter, croon, recite battle poems, scream,
        or produce other mental “noises” when first drawn, at first blood, or when they slay a significant enemy. Such a
        weapon cannot be concealed from creatures within 15 feet when it is drawn, nor can its mental “soundtrack” be
        curbed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Activation:</b> Usually a character benefits from a <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-63">psionic weapon</a> in the same way a character benefits from
        a mundane weapon—by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then
        the user usually needs to project a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought (a standard action).

        strikes a creature and the creature takes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from it, the weapon can immediately manifest the power on that
        creature as a swift action if the wielder desires. (This ability is an exception to the rule that manifesting a
        power from an item takes at least as long as manifesting that power normally.) Once the power is manifested, the
        weapon is empty, and a manifester can imbed any other targeted power of up to 5 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> into it. The weapon
        telepathically whispers to the wearer the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">name</a> of the power currently stored within it. A randomly generated

      <p>
        <i>Cognizance crystals </i>store <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> that psionic characters can use to pay for manifesting their
        powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Physical Description: </b>A <i>cognizance crystal </i>consists of a core crystal and two or three smaller
        crystals arranged in specific positions around it on strands of silver wire. The crystals give off a faint glow.
        A typical <i>cognizance crystal </i>weighs approximately 1 pound, has AC 7, 10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, a hardness of 8, and
        a break DC of 16.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Activation:</b> The user must merely hold or have a crystal on her person for a period of at least 10 minutes
        (which is long enough to attune oneself to the crystal). Thereafter, the owner can use <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> stored in
        the crystal to manifest powers she knows.
      </p>

      <p>
        The maximum number of points a <i>cognizance crystal </i>can store is always an odd number and is never more
        than 17. It can store only as many <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> as its original maximum, set at the time of its creation. When a
        <i>cognizance crystal’s </i><a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> are used up, the glow of the crystal dims. However, the user can
        recharge it by paying <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> on a 1-for-1 basis. While doing this depletes the user’s own power point
        reserve for the day, those <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> remain available in the <i>cognizance crystal </i>until used.
      </p>

      <p>
        A user cannot directly replenish her personal <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from those stored in a <i>cognizance crystal, </i>nor
        can she draw <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from more than one source to manifest a power. See <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-1-2">Using Stored Power Points</a> for more

      <h3 id="section-1-5"><a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">DORJES</a></h3>

      <p>
        A dorje is a slender crystal that contains a single power. Each dorje has 50 <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>s when created, and each
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> expended allows one use of that power. A dorje that runs out of charges is just a simple crystal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Physical Description:</b> A typical dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless), between 8
        inches and 10 inches long and about 1/2 inch thick, which can weigh up to 1/4 pound. Occasionally, a dorje is
        decorated with carvings or inscribed runes along a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC 7, 7 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>,
        a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Activation:</b> <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">Dorjes</a> use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a dorje is
        usually a standard action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. (If the power being manifested has a
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-6">manifesting time</a> longer than 1 standard action, however, it takes that long to manifest the power from a dorje.)
        The user must have the power on his class list, even if he knows the <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought. Additionally, to activate
        a dorje, a character must hold it in hand and point it in the general direction of the target or area to be
        affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">Dorjes</a> are normally created at the minimum <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> required to manifest the power, and powers that can
        be augmented are not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje’s wielder cannot augment the power contained
        within the dorje. However, <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">dorjes</a> can be created at a higher <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> than required to manifest the
        power. In this case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is augmented, to the limit of the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> and the power’s augmentation maximums, if any. The <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of a dorje cannot be more than five
        higher than the minimum <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> to use the power it contains.

      <h3 id="section-1-6"><a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">POWER STONES</a></h3>

      <p>
        A power stone stores a power (or collection of powers). A stored power can be used only once, “flushing” the
        stone. Using a power stone is basically like manifesting a power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Physical Description:</b> A power stone is a thumb-sized chunk of crystal that possesses a barely detectable
        interior glow if it holds a low-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power. A stone imprinted with more than one power or a higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power
        glows more brightly, but never enough to provide illumination in its own right. A typical power stone has AC 7,
        5 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Activation:</b> To activate a power stone, a manifester must mentally address it, as described below. Once
        the power is known, the power stone is treated as a power completion item, except as noted below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Addressing the Stone: </i>A power stone must be “addressed” before a character can use it or know exactly
        what power it contains. Doing this requires a successful <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a> check (DC 15 + power <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>). Once a particular
        power stone has been addressed, it is not necessary to do so again. Addressing a power stone in advance lets a
        character proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using a stone’s stored power after addressing the stone requires holding the stone and willing the power’s
        manifestation, as if manifesting a power normally (a standard action). Activating a power stone is subject to
        disruption just as manifesting a power normally would be.
      </p>

      <p>Additionally, the user must meet the following requirements.</p>

      <p>• The user must have the power on his or her class list.</p>

      <p>• The user must have the requisite key ability score.</p>

      <p>
        If the user meets these requirements and has a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> at least equal to the power’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>,
        she can automatically manifest the stored power without a check. If she meets both requirements but her own
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is lower than the power stone’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>, she has to make a <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level </a> check (1d20 + user’s
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>), against a DC equal to the power stone’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> +1, to manifest the power successfully. On a
        failure, the user must succeed on a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid brainburn (see below). A natural roll of 1 on
        this check is always a failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Determine Effect: </i>A power successfully manifested from a power stone works exactly as if manifested
        normally. Assume the power stone’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> is always the minimum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> required to manifest the power
        for the character who imprinted the stone, unless the creator specifically desires otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>A power stone’s glow fades when its stored power is flushed.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Brainburn: </i>When something goes awry, the user of a power stone improperly manifests the stored power. The
        resultant psionic surge persists for 1d4 rounds, unless the power stone is flung farther than 100 feet away or
        is destroyed. This surge deals 1d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> per power stored per round and arcs across multiple targets,
        similar to <i><a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-52">energy current</a></i>, except the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> type isn’t specified. The user is the primary target, and
        one nearby ally is the secondary target (chosen at random).
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> for a standard power stone is the minimum <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> needed to manifest the power
        (unless otherwise specified).

      <h3 id="section-1-7"><a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">PSICROWNS</a></h3>

      <p>
        A psicrown is a special headband that stores several powers. Unlike <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">dorjes</a>, which can contain a wide variety of
        powers, each psicrown is of a certain kind and holds specific powers. Unless otherwise stated, a psicrown has
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> equal to 50 × its <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> when created. These <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> can be spent only on the powers
        that are contained in the psicrown.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Physical Description:</b> A typical psicrown is large enough to fit on the head of a Medium creature. Some
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">psicrowns</a> are actually crownlike and heavily adorned, while others are simple headbands with crystal
        centerpieces. All <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">psicrowns</a> weigh less than 1 pound. Most <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">psicrowns</a> are metallic, but one could potentially be
        composed of any material. Metallic <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">psicrowns</a> have AC 10, 10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, hardness 8, and a break DC of 28.
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">Psicrowns</a> made of psionically reinforced silk have AC 7, 10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, hardness 2, and a break DC of 24.
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">Psicrowns</a> can be made from other, more exotic materials, but all have at least the strength and durability of
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">psicrowns</a> made of psionically reinforced silk.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Activation:</b> <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">Psicrowns</a> use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a psicrown is
        usually a standard action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. (If the power being manifested, however,
        has a longer <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-6">manifesting time</a> than 1 standard action, it takes that long to manifest the power from a psicrown.)
        When activating a psicrown, the user spends <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points </a> contained in the psicrown on any one of the psicrown’s
        powers. Powers activated from a psicrown can be augmented with additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> from the psicrown itself,
        so long as the total number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> spent does not exceed the user’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>. The user can’t
        manifest a power from a psicrown using his own <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.

      <h4>Psicrown Descriptions</h4>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">Psicrowns</a> have immense utility because they pack so many capabilities into one item and because they use the
        wearer’s ability score and relevant <a href="feats.html">feats</a> to set the DC for saves against their powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike with other sorts of <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>, the wearer can use his <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> when activating the power of a
        psicrown if it’s higher than the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of the psicrown.
      </p>

      <p>
        The minimum <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of a psicrown is 8th. The <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of a psicrown cannot be more than five
        levels higher than the minimum <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> for the highest-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power in the psicrown. Standard <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">psicrowns</a>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">Psionic tattoos</a> are designs scribed on the skin that manifest powers on their wearers. The wearer doesn’t get to
        make any decisions about the tattoo’s effect—the manifester who scribed it has already done so.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">Psionic tattoos</a> can vary in size, but a creature can wear only a total of twenty tattoos at one time—attempting
        to add one more than this maximum causes all previously scribed tattoos to simultaneously activate. A psionic
        tattoo fades away after use.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Physical Description:</b> A typical psionic tattoo is a colorful pattern of tiny, interlacing lines within a
        larger design. This design can be as simple as a circle or a star, or as complex as an artist wishes to make it.
        Once it is scribed, a tattoo’s design does not change. A psionic tattoo usually covers an area of skin no more
        than 5 inches in diameter (larger ones could be designed, but would have no added effect).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Scribing and Transferring Tattoos:</b> The <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of a psionic tattoo is the minimum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> required
        to manifest the scribed power. A psionic tattoo can contain only powers of 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or lower.
      </p>

      <p>
        A psionic tattoo inscribed on a wearer is potentially more mobile than a mundane tattoo. As a standard action,
        the wearer can will the tattoo to move to a different part of his body or onto the skin of any willing (or
        unconscious) living creature he touches. If the wearer of a psionic tattoo is rendered unconscious or is slain,
        another sentient creature can touch the tattoo while willing it to leave the previous wearer and apply itself to
        the new creature as a standard action. <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">Psionic tattoos</a> cannot overlay one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Identifying <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">Psionic Tattoos</a>: </b>In addition to the standard methods of identification, the wearer of a
        tattoo can concentrate on it and attempt to gain some sense of how it would feel if activated. A successful DC
        13 Intelligence check provides a hint to the tattoo’s effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Activation: </b>A psionic tattoo produces its effect when touched by its wearer and willed to do so. This
        activity, called “tapping” the tattoo, is a standard action that provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. A psionic
        tattoo fades away after use.
      </p>

      <p>The following rules govern the use of <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a>.</p>

      <p>
        • A creature must have an appropriate physical surface on which to scribe the pattern (thus, incorporeal
        creatures or creatures with impermanent flesh, such as fire elementals, cannot use <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        • Tapping a psionic tattoo provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. A successful attack (including grappling attacks)
        against the wearer forces a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check. A wearer who fails this check cannot concentrate effectively on
        the tattoo to use it. The tattoo remains untapped, and the wearer can make another attempt.
      </p>

      <p>
        • A character can trigger the effects of another’s psionic tattoo if the other wearer is unconscious. It is a
        full-round action to find, touch, and concentrate on an unconscious creature’s tattoo in order to tap it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> for a standard psionic tattoo is the minimum <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> needed to manifest the power
        (unless otherwise specified).

      <h4>Universal Item Descriptions</h4>

      <p><a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-9">Universal items</a> can be configured to do just about anything.</p>

      <p>Standard <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-9">universal items</a> are described below.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Amulet of Catapsi:</b> This copper <a href="monsters-s.html#section-8-3">amulet</a> aids the wearer against other psionic characters. Once per day, the
        wearer can mentally <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> the <i>catapsi </i>power, which blankets a 30- foot-radius area surrounding the
        wearer in telepathic noise for 9 rounds. Each time other psionic characters within this <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> attempt to
        manifest a power, they must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or pay 4 more points than they otherwise would for each
        power manifestation. The limit on the number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> a subject can spend on a power remains in effect,
        so the subject may not be able to manifest his or her highest-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Boots of Landing:</b> These boots allow the wearer to recover instantly from a fall and can absorb some
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a> once per day. The wearer lands on her feet no matter how far she falls, and takes 2 fewer
        <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">dice</a> of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> from the fall than normal.

        <b>Boots of Skating:</b> These boots allow the wearer to slide along the ground at will as if using the

        lb.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Crawling Tattoos:</b> Crawling tattoos resemble standard <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a>, but their effects are often harmful
        rather than beneficial. Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher
        than 3rd <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the <i>body adjustment </i>power, which can be
        scribed even though it affects only the manifester, and telepathy (compulsion) powers, which cannot be scribed
        at all. Powers that normally have an area affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an
        experience point requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated
        as <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a> until they are activated by the wearer.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>,
        mentally specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored
        power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need no
        longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.
      </p>

      <p>
        The animated tattoo moves toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as a
        Fine construct that has AC 18, 10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, a hardness of 5, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> 30 feet, and a bonus on attack rolls equal
        to the wearer’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> + his key ability modifier. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are
        subject to illusions, <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a>, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-4">teleport</a> away, or
        otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is
        destroyed, a crawling tattoo shatters and evaporates.
      </p>

      <p>
        A crawling tattoo must enter the target’s square to attack and thus provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> as it passes
        through the target’s threatened area. The tattoo makes one touch attack&nbsp; per round thereafter until it
        strikes its target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the
        target if the target fails the appropriate <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex saving
        throw automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as harmful
        ones, and a target can allow the tattoo’s touch attack to succeed if he or she desires.
      </p>

      <p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.</p>

      <p><i><a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-0-4">Market Price</a>: </i>The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power scribed in it.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Crystal Anchor: </b>A <i>crystal anchor </i>is a shaft of transparent crystal 4 to 5 feet in length, with a
        sharpened, spearlike head on one end. It ensnares the minds of those within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> who manifest powers of a
        specified psionic <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a>. The triggering <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> is specified at the time of creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <i>crystal anchor </i>is activated by plunging the sharp head into the ground, leaving the shaft freestanding.
        It projects an invisible, 30-foot-radius field. If a power from the speci- fied <a href="epic-spells.html#section-10-2">discipline</a> is manifested within
        this <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, the manifester must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + power <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) or become subject to an effect
        similar to <i><a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-25">brain lock</a></i>, except that the effect is permanent until dispelled or dismissed by the individual
        who initially drove the <i>crystal anchor </i>into the earth. Any anchor can be pulled out of the ground and
        reused at a later time.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a <i>crystal anchor </i>successfully ensnares a target, a slender filament of insubstantial ectoplasm
        connects the victim to the shaft, even one outside the original area of the field.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <i>crystal anchor </i>can attempt to ensnare a victim only five times per day. Previously caught targets can
        remain caught day after day and do not count against this daily limit on attempts.
      </p>

      <p>
        An anchor’s owner can designate certain creatures to be unaffected by the anchor; such creatures need not make a
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> and do not count against the daily limit on attempts. One <i>crystal anchor </i>can ensnare
        multiple targets simultaneously, and multiple <i>crystal anchors </i>can share overlapping fields.
      </p>

      <p>Anchors that activate when a specific power is manifested in <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> are also possible, but are rarer.</p>

      <p>A <i>crystal anchor </i>has AC 7, 15 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.</p>

        <b>Psychoactive Skins:</b> Psychoactive skins (also sometimes called ectoshells) are fistsized globs of
        psionically charged ectoplasm. As a standard action, a psychoactive skin spreads over and covers a Medium or
        smaller creature that projects the proper <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought; the same <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> thought causes the skin to shrink
        back down to its former size. Each of the various psychoactive skins is charged with one of a wide array of
        powers that constantly affect the wearer.
      </p>

      <p>
        A deployed skin completely covers the wearer and all his <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> like a second skin, allowing the wearer to
        see, hear, and breathe normally. It rolls away from various parts of the body as needed, such as when the wearer
        needs to eat or access a backpack. Held items or items specifically excluded are not covered by a psychoactive
        skin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Up to three skins can be worn simultaneously, although only the outermost is active in any given round (the
        powers of hidden skins cannot be manifested). Skin layers can be changed with a <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command </a> thought as a standard
        action, which causes a lower-layer skin to come to the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Skin of the Chameleon: </i>This psychoactive skin adjusts to surrounding textures and colors, continually

        skin on the wearer’s turn, making a ranged touch attack as described in the <i><a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-56">energy retort</a> </i>power, but the
        <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> type chosen is always fire. If the attack hits, the target takes 2d6 points of fire <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as the
        ectoburst flames up and is consumed. This attack does not in any way hinder the wearer, count against her total

      <p>
        <b>Exhausting:</b> A cursed item of this sort resembles a normal psionic item with a power that can be freely
        activated, but it instead drains the user of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> whenever he activates its power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Subversive: </b>A cursed item of this sort appears identical to a standard psionic item. However, it holds an
        inner malice for the wearer, whose <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> take a constant –2 penalty. The owner isn’t instantly aware of
        this penalty but may become aware after a while, when it becomes clear that he fails saves that others make with
        the same result on the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>.

      <p>
        <b>Reverse Capacitor:</b> A <i>reverse capacitor </i>doesn’t store <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>—it drains them, to the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3-1">surprise </a>

      </p>

      <p>
        A psionic character attempting to use the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> supposedly stored in a <i>reverse capacitor </i>instead
        loses 1d6 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per round for 7 rounds. A crackling arc connects the brow of the character with the
        stone. If the character can put more than 40 feet between himself and the <i>reverse capacitor, </i>the effect
        ends. If the <i>reverse capacitor </i>drains more <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> than the psionic character possesses, the

        least by common mortal means.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Sutra of Tranquil Thought:</b> This monastic tome describes ancient techniques of mental focus and is highly
        prized by psionic practitioners. If a psionic character who is not evil studies the work during one week of
        solitary contemplation, he gains 17 bonus <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> and experience points sufficient to place him halfway
        into the next <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of experience. Those who use their powers for evil are punished for their impertinence,

      </p>

      <p>
        The minds of nonpsionic beings are too clouded to benefit from the secrets of this book. To anyone without
        psionic aptitude, the book’s pages appear to contain nothing but elaborate patterns and drawings of mysterious

      <h4><a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-3-2">Major Artifacts</a></h4>

      <p>
        <a href="magic-items-vi-intelligent-cursed-and-artifacts.html#section-3-2">Major artifacts</a> are unique items—only one of each such item exists. They are difficult to find and dangerous to
        handle, but once found, are often even more difficult to destroy. A major psionic artifact has only a single,
        specific means of <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-16">destruction</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Annulus: </b>This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at
        bay, the <i>Annulus </i>is an artifact that any psionic being should <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>. It has been forgotten in the modern
        <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-2-1">age</a>, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the <a href="planes.html">planes</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>Annulus </i>is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other
        intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an
        adequate surface for grasping the item.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>Annulus </i>has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least
        one hand. When it is first grasped, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a> of the artifact’s powers immediately flood the wielder’s mind. The
        wielder can access all powers of the <i>Annulus </i>at <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> 20th.
      </p>

      <p>
        • The <i>Annulus </i>generates a continuous <i><a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-30">catapsi</a> </i>effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who
        is unaffected).
      </p>

      <p>• The wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals ability <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p>• Once per day, the wielder can trigger <i><a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-58">ultrablast</a> </i>as a standard action.</p>

      <p>
        • Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to
        <i>psionic <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-31">dimensional anchor</a> </i>that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary power of the <i>Annulus, </i>however, is psionic nullification. Once per year, the wielder can
        trigger this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> to complete. The wielder
        specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a
        group of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of
        <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, heat, and sound from the <i>Annulus. </i>Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are
        nontargeted beings, but any psionic target—regardless of any protection it may possess—disintegrates in a
        terrific explosion. Nothing is left but floating dust.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful
        being (such as a demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the <i>Annulus </i>to its limits. If
        it is used to nullify such a target, the artifact succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be
        retrieved by any means.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind:</b> An elaborate crystalline psicrown etched with strange designs, this
        exceptional psicrown is so invested with power that it is considered an artifact.

        The wearer of the <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind </i>also gains <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a> equal to 10 + his manifester
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind </i>has 1,000 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> when discovered. Anyone who dons the crown
        instantly knows the number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> it has at the current time. The crown recharges itself, gaining back
        1 power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000 points.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a special one-time use of the psicrown, the wearer can channel all the remaining charges in the psicrown into
        an uncontrolled <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> of <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>. The wearer triggers this use as a standard action. All within 20 feet of the

        wearer inhabits a tiny eye of calm at the center of the <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-16">destruction</a> and is unharmed, but the psicrown is reduced
        to a burned-out cinder.

      <p>
        To calculate the costs involved in creating a psionic item, refer to <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-11">Creating Magic Items</a>. Although that
        information deals with magic items, the price formulas presented there are identical to those for <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating psionic <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> and psionic <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> is almost identical to the requirements for <a href="magic-items-i-basics-and-creation.html#section-13">creating magic armor</a> and

      </p>

      <h4>Creating <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">Dorjes</a></h4>

      <p>
        To create a dorje, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a chunk of crystal or
        the crystal shards of the dorje to be carved from or assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the
        cost of creating the dorje—375 gp × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the manifester. <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">Dorjes</a> are always
        fully charged (50 charges) when created.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an augmentable power is incorporated into a dorje at a higher <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> than the minimum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>
        required to manifest the power, each discharge of the power from the dorje is augmented to the limit of that
        higher <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>. Alternatively, if you want to have a higher <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> in the dorje, you must pay
        for the dorje as if the power was one <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> higher for each additional two manifester levels you want.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the dorje (or must have the power available in some
        other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays the cost
        (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the dorje in addition to the <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> for making the dorje
        itself. The act of working on the dorje costs a number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points </a> per day equal to the power point cost of
        the power that is being embedded in the crystal of the dorje.
      </p>

      <p>Crafting a dorje requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

      <h4>Creating <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">Power Stones</a></h4>

      <p>
        To create a power stone, a character needs a supply of incense and fine etching tools, the cost of which is
        subsumed in the cost of encoding the power stone—12.5 gp × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the manifester.
        All materials used to imprint a power stone must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the full cost for
        encoding each power stone no matter how many times she previously has imprinted the same power.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the power stone (or must have the power available
        in some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays the
        cost upon beginning the power stone in addition to the <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> for making the power stone itself.
        The act of encoding triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number
        of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Encoding a power stone requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

      <h4>Creating <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">Psicrowns</a></h4>

      <p>
        To create a psicrown, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a circlet, crown, or the
        pieces of the crown to be assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of creating the
        psicrown—375 gp × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the highest-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the manifester, + 75% of the value of the
        next highest-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power (281.25 gp × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the manifester), + one-half of the
        value of any other powers (187.5 gp × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> of the manifester). <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-7">Psicrowns</a> are
        always created with full <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, if you want to have a higher <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> in the psicrown, you must pay for the psicrown as
        if the highest-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> power is one <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> higher for each additional two manifester levels you want.

        The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the psicrown (or must have the power available in
        some other form). If any of the powers has an XP cost, the creator must provide XP equal to 50 × that cost. This
        expense is in addition to the <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> for making the psicrown itself. The act of working on a
        psicrown costs a number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> per day equal to the cost of manifesting each of the powers associated
        with the psicrown once per day.
      </p>

      <p>Crafting a psicrown requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

      <h4>Creating <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">Psionic Tattoos</a></h4>

      <p>
        The creator of a psionic tattoo must have a patch of uncovered skin free of hair and fur, and at least a few
        containers in which to mix dyes. In addition, he needs <a href="special-materials.html">special materials</a>, usually to create dyes. The costs for
        materials and dyes are subsumed in the cost for scribing the psionic tattoo— 25 gp × the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power x
        the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the manifester. All ingredients and materials used to scribe a psionic tattoo must be fresh and
        unused. The character must pay the full cost for scribing each psionic tattoo. (Economies of scale do not
        apply.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The user of the psionic tattoo is both the manifester and the target; therefore, powers that target another
        creature<i> </i>cannot be stored in psionic tattoo form. Powers with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of personal can be made into
        <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a>, but they cost double the price of standard <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creator must know the power to be placed in the psionic tattoo (or must have the power available in some
        other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning
        the scribing in addition to the <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> for making the psionic tattoo itself. The act of scribing
        triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number of <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Scribing a psionic tattoo requires one day.</p>

      <h4>Creating <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-9">Universal Items</a></h4>

      <p>
        To create a universal item, a character usually needs some sort of <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> or tools to work on the item. He
        also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be
        assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Universal item costs are
        difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values<i> </i>and use the given item
        prices as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.
      </p>

      <p>
        If powers are involved in the <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a> for making the item, the creator must know the power to be placed in
        the item (or must have the power available in some other form). Any <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost </a> for a prerequisite
        power is not incurred by the creator of the item. The act of working on the item requires a payment of power
        points appropriate to the power or powers associated with the item during each day of the item’s creation.
      </p>

      <p>Crafting a universal item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

      <h2 id="section-3"><a href="special-materials.html">SPECIAL MATERIALS</a></h2>

      <p>In addition to <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> with imbedded powers, some substances have innate special properties.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Crystal, Deep: </b>Deep crystal is crystal of above-average quality found at the hearts of large veins or
        deposits of mundane crystal (see below). Deep crystal is renowned for its strength and its psionically resonant
        nature. Mundane crystal is used for many items of psionic manufacture, such as <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-5">dorjes</a>, <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">power stones</a>, and
        psicrystals. Deep crystal is a better grade.
      </p>

      <p>
        While a weapon made of deep crystal is no different from a mundane crystal weapon for a nonpsionic character, a
        psionic wielder of a deep crystal weapon can focus psionic power through it, increasing the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> that weapon
        deals. As a free action that does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>, the wielder can channel psionic power into
        a melee weapon or ranged weapon made of deep crystal. For 2 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>, the deep crystal weapon deals an extra
        2d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. The weapon will stay charged for 1 minute or until it scores its next hit. Bows,
        crossbows, and slings bestow this power on their ammunition. All missile <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> lose this effect if they miss.
        However, they may be recovered and charged again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any weapon made of deep crystal costs 1,000 gp more than its noncrystal counterpart. Any item could potentially
        be made out of deep crystal. Because deep crystal <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> is considered to be made out of metal, druids cannot
        wear it.
      </p>

      <p>Deep crystal has 30 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and a hardness of 10.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Crystal, Mundane:</b> Mundane crystal can be used in place of metal in <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> or <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, using a special
        forging process. The fortified crystal possesses the properties of a similar masterwork steel weapon or <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>,
        except for visual appearance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="equipment.html#section-2">Weapons</a> and <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> made of mundane crystal cost the same amount to make as their masterwork counterparts. Any
        item could potentially be made with mundane crystal. Because mundane crystal <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> is considered to be made out
        of metal, druids cannot wear it.
      </p>

      <p>Mundane crystal properly forged has 25 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and a hardness of 8.</p>
