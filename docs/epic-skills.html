<h1>EPIC SKILLS </h1>



<p>Despite
the near-magical nature of some epic level skill uses, all uses of skills are
considered exceptional abilities (except if noted otherwise), and thus function
normally even within areas of antimagic. </p>



<h2>Skill Synergy </h2>

<p>Many
skills are noted as granting a synergy bonus to the use of another skill when a
character has 5 or more ranks in the first skill. This synergy bonus increases
by +2 for every additional 20 ranks the character has in the skill. </p>



<h3>SKILL DESCRIPTIONS
</h3>

<p>This
section describes new DCs and new modifiers for skills. </p>



<h3>Appraise </h3>

<p>The
character can sense magical auras in objects. </p>

<p><b>Detect
Magic:</b><i>
</i>The
character can sense if an item has a magical aura. He or she can then use
Spellcraft to learn more about the item as if he or she had already cast <i>detect
magic </i>on the item. This requires a full-round action. </p>

<p>*Includes
any other surface that couldn’t support the character’s weight, such as a
fragile branch. </p>



<h3>Bluff </h3>

<p>The
character can implant a nonmagical suggestion in a target, display a false
alignment, or disguise his or her surface thoughts. </p>

  </td>
  <td valign="top">
  <p>100
  </p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><b>Instill
Suggestion in Target:</b><i> </i>This is identical to the effect of the <i>suggestion </i>spell,
except that it is nonmagical and lasts for only 10 minutes. It can be sensed as
if it were an enchantment effect (Sense Motive DC 25). </p>

<p><b>Display
False Alignment:</b><i> </i>The character can fool alignment-sensing effects by
displaying a false alignment of his or her choice. Once set, a false alignment
remains as long as the character remains conscious and awake. Setting or
changing a false alignment requires a full-round action. </p>

<p><b>Disguise
Surface Thoughts:</b><i> </i>The character can fool spells such as <i>detect thoughts </i>(or
similar effects) by displaying false surface thoughts. While the character
can’t completely mask the presence of his or her thoughts, he or she can change
his or her apparent Intelligence score (and thus the character’s apparent
mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in his or
her “surface thoughts” to be read by such spells or effects. If a character
attempts to use Sense Motive to detect his or her surface thoughts (see the
Sense Motive skill description), this becomes an opposed check (though any
result lower than 100 automatically fails). </p>



<h3>Climb </h3>

<p>The
character can climb otherwise unclimbable surfaces. </p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
 <tbody><tr>
  <th colspan="1">

  </td>
  <td valign="top">
  <p>A
  perfectly smooth, flat, overhang or ceiling </p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><b>Rapid
Climbing:</b><i>
</i>A
character can climb his or her speed as a move-equivalent action, or double his
or her speed as a full-round action (requiring two Climb checks), but the
character takes a –20 penalty on his or her check. </p>

<p>Special:
The Legendary Climber feat allows a character to ignore any penalties for
accelerated or rapid climbing. </p>



<h3>Concentration </h3>

<p>The
character can cast spells with somatic components even while grappled. </p>

<h3>Craft </h3>

<p>The
character can craft items more quickly than normal. </p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
 <tbody><tr>
  <th colspan="1">

  <p>Quick

  </td>
  <td valign="top">
  <p>+10
  or more to DC </p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><b>Quick
Creation: </b>A
character can voluntarily increase the DC of crafting an item by any multiple
of 10. This allows the character to create an item more quickly (since he or
she will be multiplying this higher DC by his or her skill check result to
determine progress). The character must decide the increase to the DC before
making the check. </p>



<h3>Craft (Alchemy)</h3>

 </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><b>Create
Augmented Alchemical Item or Substance:</b><i> </i>This requires the Augmented Alchemy
feat, and allows a character to create alchemical items and substances of
greater power than normal. To augment an alchemical substance, add +20 to the
DC required to create the item and multiply the cost by 5. If the item or
substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance
doesn’t deal damage, double the duration of its effect. If the item or
substance doesn’t deal damage and doesn’t have a specific listed duration (or
has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item
or substance doesn’t fit any of these categories, then it cannot be improved in
this manner. A character can create an item with multiple degrees of
augmentation. For every additional multiplier applied to damage, duration, or
area, add an additional +20 to the DC and add an additional 5 to the cost
multiplier. </p>

<p><b>Fanatic:
</b>The
attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the obvious effects, any NPC
whose attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution
scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a –1 penalty to AC whenever
fighting for the character or his or her cause. This attitude will remain for
one day plus one day per point of the character’s Charisma bonus, at which
point the NPC’s attitude will revert to its original attitude (or indifferent,
if no attitude is specified). </p>

<p>Treat
the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of
immunity, save bonuses, or being detected by the Sense Motive skill. Since it
is nonmagical, it can’t be dispelled; however, any effect that suppresses or
counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s
attitude can’t be further adjusted by the use of skills. </p>

size category greater than Medium-size. If the space is long, such as in a
chimney, multiple checks may be called for. </p>

patients at a time. No character’s recovery can be quickened more than once per
day (even by different healers). </p>

<p><b>Perfect
Recovery:</b><i>
</i>The
character can allow a character to regain hit points in a single hour as if he
or she had provided long-term care for a full week (2 or 3 hit points per level
per day, based on activity). The character can use perfect recovery on up to
six patients at a time. No character’s recovery can be perfected more than once
per day, nor can perfect recovery and quicken recovery both be used on the same
patient in the same day (even by different healers).</p>

<p><b><i>Hide
Another:</i></b><i>
</i>By
accepting a –30 penalty on his or her Hide check, a character can hide another
adjacent creature whose size is no more than one category larger than the
character’s own. Modifiers to the check for the size of the creature still
apply, as do all other penalties, including those for moving faster than half
speed. Likewise, a character can only hide another creature when it is not
under direct observation by a third party. The creature the character hides
remains hidden until it is spotted or it takes some other action that breaks
its concealment, as normal. </p>

<p><b>Defeat
Illusion:</b><i>
</i>The
character can automatically detect any illusion with an auditory component for
what it truly is. No Will save is required, and the character doesn’t have to
interact with the illusion (but he or she must be able to hear its auditory
component). Special: A character can use Listen to notice the presence of an
invisible creature (generally opposed by a Move Silently check). If the
character beats the DC by 20 or more, he or she can pinpoint the location of
the invisible creature, though it still maintains total concealment from the
character (50% miss chance). </p>

<p><b>Fanatic:
</b>The
attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the obvious effects, any NPC
whose attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution
scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a –1 penalty to AC whenever
fighting for the character or his or her cause. This attitude will remain for
one day plus one day per point of the character’s Charisma bonus, at which
point the NPC’s attitude will revert to its original attitude (or indifferent,
if no attitude is specified). </p>

<p>Treat
the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of
immunity, save bonuses, or being detected by the Sense Motive skill. Since it
is nonmagical, it can’t be dispelled; however, any effect that suppresses or
counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s
attitude can’t be further adjusted by the use of skills. </p>

<p><b>Stand
on Mount: </b>This
allows the character to stand on his or her mount’s back even during movement
or combat. The character takes no penalties to actions while doing so. </p>

<p><b>Unconscious
Control: </b>As
a free action, the character can attempt to control a light horse, pony, or heavy
horse while in combat. If the character fails, he or she controls the mount as
a move-equivalent action. A character does not need to roll for warhorses or
warponies. </p>

<p><b>Attack
from Cover: </b>The
character can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside his or her mount,
using it as one-half cover. The character can attack and cast spells while
using his or her mount as cover without penalty. If the character fails, he or
she doesn’t get the cover benefit. </p>

<p><b>Discern
Partial Alignment: </b>This use of the skill lets a character discern one component
of a target’s alignment. When making the check, the character states whether he
or she is trying to discern the law–chaos or good–evil component. A character
can’t retry the check, and he or she can’t use this to discern more than one
component of the alignment (but see below). The target must be visible and
within 30 feet of the character. </p>

<p><b>Discern
Full Alignment: </b>This
use of the skill lets a character determine both components of a target’s alignment.
The character can’t retry the check. The target must be visible and within 30
feet of the character. </p>

<p><b>Detect
Surface Thoughts: </b>This lets a character read the surface thoughts of a single
target (as the 3rd-round effect of the <i>detect thoughts </i>spell). There is
no saving throw to resist this effect, though the target can use Bluff to
disguise his or her surface thoughts (see the Bluff skill description), in
which case this becomes an opposed check (any result lower than 100
automatically fails). The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the
character.</p>

item. A character can’t attempt this on the same item more than once. </p>

<p><b>Identify
All Properties of Magic Item:</b><i> </i>This requires one minute of inspection, and reveals all
properties of a single magic item (including command words and charges
remaining). A character can’t attempt this on the same item more than once. If
an item has different caster levels for different properties, use the highest
caster level. </p>

<p><b>Quick
Identification: </b>A
character can identify a substance or potion in the field as a full-round
action, without an alchemical lab or any cost. The character can’t retry this
check (or take 20); if he or she fails, the character must identify the
substance in an alchemical lab, as normal. </p>

a successful check, the character knows the direction to the desired location.
This merely points the character in the direction of the location; it doesn’t
provide him or her with information on how to get there, nor does it take into
account any obstacles in the path. “Very familiar” represents a place where the
character has been very often and where he or she feels at home. “Studied
carefully” represents a place the character knows well, either because he or
she has been there often or has used other means to study the place. “Seen
casually” is a place that the character has viewed more than once, but which he
or she has not studied. “Viewed once” is a place that the character has seen
once, possibly using magic. “Description only” is a place whose location and
appearance the character knows through someone else’s description. </p>

<p><b>Free
Stand: </b>The
character can stand up from prone as a free action (instead of as a
move-equivalent action). </p>

<p><b>Climb
Vertical Surface: </b>The character can climb up to 20 feet (as part of normal
move-ment) by jumping and bouncing off walls, trees, or similar vertical surfaces.
The character must have at least two vertical surfaces to bounce off, and the
two must be within 10 feet of each other. </p>

<p><b>Ignore
Falling Damage: </b>The
character can fall from any height and take no damage. </p>

<p>Special:
A character with 25 or more ranks in Tumble gains a +5 dodge bonus when
executing the fight defensively standard or full-round action, instead of a +2
bonus (or the +3 bonus from having 5 or more ranks). Increase this dodge bonus
by +1 for every 10 additional ranks above 25 the character has. A character
with 25 or more ranks in Tumble gains a +10 dodge bonus to AC when executing
the total defense standard action, instead of a +4 bonus (or the +6 bonus from
having 5 or more ranks). Increase this dodge bonus by +2 for every 10
additional ranks above 25 the character has. </p>



<h3>Use Magic Device </h3>

<p>Use
Magic Device does not possess an epic usage. </p>



<h3>Use Rope </h3>

<p>The
character can splice ropes together quickly, tie unique knots, and even animate
a rope he or she holds. </p>

<p><b>Quick
Splicing:</b><i>
</i>The
character can splice two ropes together as a move-equivalent action. </p>

<p><b>Tie
Unique Knot:</b><i>
</i>The
character can tie a knot that only he or she knows how to untie. This doesn’t
affect any Escape Artist checks made to escape these bindings. </p>

<p><b>Animate
Held Rope:</b>
The character can command any rope he or she holds as if it had the <i>animate
rope </i>spell cast upon it (except that using the skill in this way doesn’t
grant any bonus on Use Rope checks made with the animated rope). Each command
requires a separate Use Rope check. Because the effect isn’t magical, it can’t
be dispelled. </p>





<h2>PSIONIC SKILLS</h2>



<h3>Autohypnosis </h3>

<p>The
character has trained his or her mind to ignore poison, resist mental
influence, and convince his or her body that he or she is tougher than normal. </p>

  <p>When
  poisoned, the character can make an Autohypnosis check on his or her next

  automatically ignores. </p>

<h3>
spells</h3>

<p>To
attempt any of these tasks, the <i>scrying </i>spell must be on your class
spell list (though it need not be among your spells known). If you have any
bonuses that would apply to the caster level of your <i>scrying </i>spell, add
these to your caster level check.</p>

<p><b>Learn
Scryer: </b>If
you determine that you’re being scried upon, you can learn the identity of the
scryer with a DC 30 caster level check. If successful, you learn the name,
race, and location of the scryer. </p>

<p><b>Return
Scrying: </b>If
you determine that you’re being scried upon, you can look back through the
sensor at the scryer with a DC 50 caster level check. This allows you to spy on
the scrying being as if you had cast a <i>scrying </i>spell upon that person.
This return scrying can be detected by your target as normal.</p>

<p><b>Break Scrying: </b>If you determine that you’re being scried,
you can make an opposed caster level check with the scryer. (Your caster level
must be at least 21st to attempt this task.) If you are successful, the scrying
ends, and the scryer may not target you with a Divination (Scrying) spell or effect
for a number of hours equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</p>
