      <p>
        Despite the near-magical nature of some epic level skill uses, all uses of skills are considered exceptional
        abilities (except if noted otherwise), and thus function normally even within areas of antimagic.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-1">Skill Synergy</h3>

      <p>
        Many skills are noted as granting a synergy bonus to the use of another skill when a character has 5 or more
        ranks in the first skill. This synergy bonus increases by +2 for every additional 20 ranks the character has in
        the skill.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-1">SKILL DESCRIPTIONS</h2>

      <p>This section describes new DCs and new modifiers for skills.</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-1">Appraise</h3>

      <p>The character can sense magical auras in objects.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Detect Magic:</b><i> </i>The character can sense if an item has a magical aura. He or she can then use
        Spellcraft to learn more about the item as if he or she had already cast <i>detect magic </i>on the item. This

      <h3 id="section-1-3">Bluff</h3>

      <p>
        The character can implant a nonmagical suggestion in a target, display a false alignment, or disguise his or her
        surface thoughts.

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        <b>Instill Suggestion in Target:</b><i> </i>This is identical to the effect of the <i>suggestion </i>spell,
        except that it is nonmagical and lasts for only 10 minutes. It can be sensed as if it were an enchantment effect
        (Sense Motive DC 25).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Display False Alignment:</b><i> </i>The character can fool alignment-sensing effects by displaying a false
        alignment of his or her choice. Once set, a false alignment remains as long as the character remains conscious
        and awake. Setting or changing a false alignment requires a full-round action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Disguise Surface Thoughts:</b><i> </i>The character can fool spells such as <i>detect thoughts </i>(or
        similar effects) by displaying false surface thoughts. While the character can’t completely mask the presence of
        his or her thoughts, he or she can change his or her apparent Intelligence score (and thus the character’s
        apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in his or her “surface thoughts” to
        be read by such spells or effects. If a character attempts to use Sense Motive to detect his or her surface
        thoughts (see the Sense Motive skill description), this becomes an opposed check (though any result lower than
        100 automatically fails).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-4">Climb</h3>

      <p>The character can climb otherwise unclimbable surfaces.</p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        <b>Rapid Climbing:</b><i> </i>A character can climb his or her speed as a move-equivalent action, or double his
        or her speed as a full-round action (requiring two Climb checks), but the character takes a –20 penalty on his
        or her check.
      </p>

      <p>
        Special: The Legendary Climber feat allows a character to ignore any penalties for accelerated or rapid
        climbing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-5">Concentration</h3>

      <p>The character can cast spells with somatic components even while grappled.</p>

            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        <b>Quick Creation: </b>A character can voluntarily increase the DC of crafting an item by any multiple of 10.
        This allows the character to create an item more quickly (since he or she will be multiplying this higher DC by
        his or her skill check result to determine progress). The character must decide the increase to the DC before
        making the check.

      <p>
        <b>Create Augmented Alchemical Item or Substance:</b><i> </i>This requires the Augmented Alchemy feat, and
        allows a character to create alchemical items and substances of greater power than normal. To augment an
        alchemical substance, add +20 to the DC required to create the item and multiply the cost by 5. If the item or
        substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage, double the
        duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage and doesn’t have a specific listed duration
        (or has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn’t fit any
        of these categories, then it cannot be improved in this manner. A character can create an item with multiple
        degrees of augmentation. For every additional multiplier applied to damage, duration, or area, add an additional
        +20 to the DC and add an additional 5 to the cost multiplier.

        <b>Fanatic: </b>The attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the obvious effects, any NPC whose
        attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will
        saves, and a –1 penalty to AC whenever fighting for the character or his or her cause. This attitude will remain
        for one day plus one day per point of the character’s Charisma bonus, at which point the NPC’s attitude will
        revert to its original attitude (or indifferent, if no attitude is specified).
      </p>

      <p>
        Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or
        being detected by the Sense Motive skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can’t be dispelled; however, any effect
        that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s attitude can’t be
        further adjusted by the use of skills.

        ><i> </i>By accepting a –30 penalty on his or her Hide check, a character can hide another adjacent creature
        whose size is no more than one category larger than the character’s own. Modifiers to the check for the size of
        the creature still apply, as do all other penalties, including those for moving faster than half speed.
        Likewise, a character can only hide another creature when it is not under direct observation by a third party.
        The creature the character hides remains hidden until it is spotted or it takes some other action that breaks
        its concealment, as normal.

        Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or

        that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s attitude can’t be

        good–evil component. A character can’t retry the check, and he or she can’t use this to discern more than one
        component of the alignment (but see below). The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the character.

        the target can use Bluff to disguise his or her surface thoughts (see the Bluff skill description), in which

        With a successful check, the character knows the direction to the desired location. This merely points the
        character in the direction of the location; it doesn’t provide him or her with information on how to get there,
        nor does it take into account any obstacles in the path. “Very familiar” represents a place where the character
        has been very often and where he or she feels at home. “Studied carefully” represents a place the character
        knows well, either because he or she has been there often or has used other means to study the place. “Seen
        casually” is a place that the character has viewed more than once, but which he or she has not studied. “Viewed
        once” is a place that the character has seen once, possibly using magic. “Description only” is a place whose
        location and appearance the character knows through someone else’s description.

      <p>
        The character has trained his or her mind to ignore poison, resist mental influence, and convince his or her
        body that he or she is tougher than normal.

              When poisoned, the character can make an Autohypnosis check on his or her next action. A successful check
              indicates the character does not have to make a saving throw against the poison’s secondary damage, which
              he or she instead automatically ignores.

            <td>
              If a failed saving throw indicates the character is affected by any mind-affecting powers, spells, or
              spell-like effects, a successful Autohypnosis check allows an immediate second saving throw to resist the
              effect. If the mind-affecting effect normally does not allow a saving throw, a successful Autohypnosis
              check allows a saving throw.

              With a successful Autohypnosis check, the character gains temporary hit points equal to 10 + his or her
              Wisdom modifier. The temporary hit points persist until lost. A character cannot check for temporary hit
              points more than once per day. Temporary hit points gained through Autohypnosis do not stack with
              temporary hit points gained through any other source

              If reduced to negative hit points but not dead, make a Stabilize Self check. If successful, the character
              does not go unconscious and can continue taking actions until he or she bleeds to death or stabilizes (the
              character can also continue making stabilization checks). If healed or stabilized, the character continues
              to take actions normally.

              On a successful Stabilize Self check, the character gains damage reduction 2/–. The damage reduction lasts
              for 12 hours. The character cannot check for damage reduction more than once per day. Damage reduction
              gained through Stabilize Self does not stack with damage reduction gained through any other source.

        <i>scrying </i>spell, add these to your caster level check.

        <b>Learn Scryer: </b>If you determine that you’re being scried upon, you can learn the identity of the scryer
        with a DC 30 caster level check. If successful, you learn the name, race, and location of the scryer.

        <b>Return Scrying: </b>If you determine that you’re being scried upon, you can look back through the sensor at
        the scryer with a DC 50 caster level check. This allows you to spy on the scrying being as if you had cast a
        <i>scrying </i>spell upon that person. This return scrying can be detected by your target as normal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Break Scrying: </b>If you determine that you’re being scried, you can make an opposed caster level check with
        the scryer. (Your caster level must be at least 21st to attempt this task.) If you are successful, the scrying
        ends, and the scryer may not target you with a Divination (Scrying) spell or effect for a number of hours equal
        to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).
