      <h1><a href="epic-skills.html">EPIC SKILLS</a></h1>

      <p>
        Despite the near-magical nature of some epic <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> skill uses, all uses of skills are considered exceptional
        abilities (except if noted otherwise), and thus function normally even within areas of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-1"><a href="epic-skills.html#section-0-1">Skill Synergy</a></h3>

      <p>
        Many skills are noted as granting a synergy bonus to the use of another skill when a character has 5 or more
        ranks in the first skill. This synergy bonus increases by +2 for every additional 20 ranks the character has in
        the skill.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="skills-i.html#section-3">SKILL DESCRIPTIONS</a></h2>

      <p>This section describes new DCs and new modifiers for skills.</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-1"><a href="skills-i.html#section-3-2">Appraise</a></h3>

      <p>The character can sense magical auras in objects.</p>

        similar effects) by displaying false surface thoughts. While the character can’t completely mask the presence of
        his or her thoughts, he or she can change his or her apparent Intelligence score (and thus the character’s
        apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in his or her “surface thoughts” to
        be read by such <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or effects. If a character attempts to use <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> to detect his or her surface
        thoughts (see the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> skill description), this becomes an opposed check (though any result lower than
        100 automatically fails).

        substance deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, double the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt. If the item or substance doesn’t deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, double the

        <b>Fanatic: </b>The attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the obvious effects, any NPC whose
        attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will
        saves, and a –1 penalty to AC whenever fighting for the character or his or her cause. This attitude will remain
        for one day plus one day per point of the character’s Charisma bonus, at which point the NPC’s attitude will
        revert to its original attitude (or indifferent, if no attitude is specified).

      <p>
        Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or
        being detected by the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can’t be dispelled; however, any effect
        that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s attitude can’t be
        further adjusted by the use of skills.

        good–evil component. A character can’t retry the check, and he or she can’t use this to discern more than one
        component of the <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> (but see below). The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the character.

        nor does it take into account any obstacles in the path. “Very familiar” represents a place where the character
        has been very often and where he or she feels at home. “Studied carefully” represents a place the character
        knows well, either because he or she has been there often or has used other means to study the place. “Seen
        casually” is a place that the character has viewed more than once, but which he or she has not studied. “Viewed
        once” is a place that the character has seen once, possibly using magic. “Description only” is a place whose
        location and appearance the character knows through someone else’s description.
