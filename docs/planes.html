      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="planes.html#section-1">WHAT IS A PLANE?</a></h2>

      <p>
        The <a href="planes.html">planes</a> of existence are different realities with interwoven connections. Except for rare linking points,
        each plane is effectively its own universe with its own natural laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="planes.html">planes</a> break down into a number of general types: <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, the Transitive <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>, the Inner
        <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>, the Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>, and the demiplanes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Material Plane: </b><a href="planes.html#section-3-1">The Material Plane</a> tends to be the most Earthlike of all <a href="planes.html">planes</a> and operates under the
        same set of natural laws that our own real world does. This is the default plane for most adventures.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Transitive Planes:</b> These three <a href="planes.html">planes</a> have one important common characteristic: Each is used to get from
        one place to another. <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">The Astral Plane</a> is a conduit to all other <a href="planes.html">planes</a>, while <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane </a> and the Plane
        of <a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">Shadow</a> both serve as means of transportation within <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> they’re connected to. These <a href="planes.html">planes</a>
        have the strongest regular interaction with <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> and are often accessed by using various <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>.
        They have native inhabitants as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Inner <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>:</b> These six <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the universe. Each is
        made up of a single type of <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> or element that overwhelms all others. The natives of a particular Inner
        Plane are made of the same <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> or element as the plane itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Outer Planes:</b> The deities live on the Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>, as do creatures such as celestials, demons, and
        devils. Each of the Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a> has an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, representing a particular moral or ethical outlook, and the
        natives of each plane tend to behave in agreement with that plane’s <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. The Outer <a href="planes.html">Planes</a> are also the
        final resting place of souls from <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, whether that final rest takes the form of calm
        introspection or eternal <a href="epic-spells.html#section-7-6">damnation</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Demiplanes:</b> This catch-all category covers all extradimensional spaces that function like <a href="planes.html">planes</a> but have
        measurable size and limited access. Other kinds of <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane
        might be only a few hundred feet across.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-2"><a href="planes.html#section-2">PLANAR TRAITS</a></h2>

      <p>Each plane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.</p>

      <p><a href="planes.html#section-2">Planar traits</a> are broken down into a number of general areas.</p>

      <p>All <a href="planes.html">planes</a> have the following kinds of traits.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Physical Traits:</b> These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including how
        gravity and time function.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Elemental and <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">Energy</a> Traits:</b> These traits determine the dominance of particular <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">elemental</a> or <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>
        forces.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Alignment Traits:</b> Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are tied to a
        particular moral or ethical outlook.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Magic Traits:</b> Magic works differently from plane to plane, and magic traits set the boundaries for what
        it can and can’t do.
      </p>

      <h4>Physical Traits</h4>

      <p>
        The two most important natural laws set by physical traits are how gravity works and how time passes. Other
        physical traits pertain to the size and shape of a plane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Gravity:</b> The direction of gravity’s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the
        plane itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Normal Gravity: </i>Most <a href="planes.html">planes</a> have gravity similar to that of <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>. The usual rules for
        <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>, <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-1">carrying capacity</a>, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise noted in a description, it is assumed
        every plane has the normal gravity trait.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Heavy Gravity: </i>The gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>. As
        a result, <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-3">Balance</a>, <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">Climb</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a>, and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-20">Tumble</a> checks incur a –2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack
        rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. Weapon ranges are
        halved. A character’s Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters who fall on a heavy gravity
        plane take 1d10 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> for each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Light Gravity: </i>The gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>. As a
        result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their movements tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane
        with the <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> gravity trait take a –2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-3">Balance</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a>, <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a>, and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-20">Tumble</a>
        checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-5">Climb</a>
        and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">Jump</a> checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strength and Dexterity don’t change as a result of <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> gravity, but what you can do with such scores does
        change. These advantages apply to travelers from other <a href="planes.html">planes</a> as well as natives.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">Falling</a> characters on a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> gravity plane take 1d4 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum
        20d4).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>No Gravity: </i>Individuals on a plane with this trait merely <a href="psionic-powers-d-f.html#section-0-77">float</a> in space, unless other resources are
        available to provide a direction for gravity’s pull.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Objective Directional Gravity: </i>The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the
        Material Plane, but the direction is not the traditional “down” toward the ground. It may be down toward any
        solid object, at an angle to the surface of the plane itself, or even upward.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The direction of “down” may vary.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Subjective Directional Gravity: </i>The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the
        Material Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of gravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for
        unattended objects and nonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer,
        but is common on “weightless” <a href="planes.html">planes</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining
        “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and
        “<a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a>” that way. Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in
        each succeeding round. <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a> is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-42">slow</a> one’s <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> by
        changing the designated “down” direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300
        feet per round thereafter).
      </p>

      <p>
        It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once
        per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent
        checks until he or she succeeds.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Time:</b> The rate of time’s passage can vary on different <a href="planes.html">planes</a>, though it remains constant within any
        particular plane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various <a href="planes.html">planes</a>.
        Travelers may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time while moving among the <a href="planes.html">planes</a>, but from their point of
        view, time always passes naturally.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Normal Time: </i>This trait describes the way time passes on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>. One hour on a plane with
        normal time equals one hour on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>. Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the
        normal time trait.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Timeless: </i>On <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How the
        timeless trait can affect certain activities or <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> such as hunger, thirst, aging, the effects of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>,
        and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a> varies from plane to plane.
      </p>

      <p>
        The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally,
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> such as hunger and aging do occur retroactively.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Flowing Time: </i>On some <a href="planes.html">planes</a>, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, spend a
        year there, then return to <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> to find that only six seconds have elapsed. Everything on the
        plane returned to is only a few seconds older. But for that traveler and the items, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, and effects working
        on him, that year away was entirely real.
      </p>

      <p>
        When designating how time works on <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with flowing time, put <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>’s flow of time first,
        followed by the same flow in the other plane.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Erratic Time: </i>Some <a href="planes.html">planes</a> have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time
        as he moves between the two <a href="planes.html">planes</a>. The following is provided as an example.

      <p>To the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed.</p>

      <p>
        If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a noninstantaneous <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> is permanent until
        dispelled.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Shape and Size:</b> <a href="planes.html">Planes</a> come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are infinite, or at least so
        large that they may as well be infinite.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Infinite: </i><a href="planes.html">Planes</a> with this trait go on forever, though they may have finite <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> within them. Or
        they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map that stretches out infinitely.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Finite Shape: </i>A plane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin other <a href="planes.html">planes</a>
        or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great wall. Demiplanes are often finite.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Self-Contained Shape: </i>On <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the
        traveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a self-contained, finite plane, but
        there can be cubes, toruses, and flat <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with magical edges that <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-4">teleport</a> the traveler to an opposite edge
        when he crosses them.
      </p>

      <p>Some demiplanes are self-contained.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Morphic Traits:</b> This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some <a href="planes.html">planes</a>
        are responsive to sentient thought, while others can be manipulated only by extremely powerful creatures. And
        some <a href="planes.html">planes</a> respond to physical or magical efforts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Alterable Morphic: </i>On a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are) unless
        affected by physical force or magic. You can change the immediate environment as a result of tangible effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Highly Morphic: </i>On a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it’s
        difficult to keep a particular area stable. Such <a href="planes.html">planes</a> may react dramatically to specific <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, sentient
        thought, or the <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-27">force of will</a>. Others change for no reason.
      </p>

      <p><i>Magically Morphic: </i>Specific <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Divinely Morphic: </i>Specific unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter
        objects, creatures, and the landscape on <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with this trait. Ordinary characters find these <a href="planes.html">planes </a> similar
        to alterable <a href="planes.html">planes</a> in that they may be affected by <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and physical effort. But the deities may cause these
        areas to change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Static: </i>These <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane, nor objects
        that the denizens possess. Any <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that would affect those on the plane have no effect unless the plane’s
        static trait is somehow removed or suppressed. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain
        in effect, however.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even moving an unattended object within a static plane requires a DC 16 Strength check. Particularly heavy
        objects may be impossible to move.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Sentient: </i>These <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are ones that respond to a single thought— that of the plane itself. Travelers
        would find the plane’s landscape changing as a result of what the plane thought of the travelers, either
        becoming more or less hospitable depending on its reaction.
      </p>

      <h4><a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">Elemental</a> and <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">Energy</a> Traits</h4>

      <p>
        Four basic elements and two types of <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> together make up everything. The elements are earth, air, fire, and
        water. The types of <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> are positive and negative.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">The Material Plane</a> reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there. Each of the Inner
        <a href="planes.html">Planes</a> is dominated by one element or type of <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>. Other <a href="planes.html">planes</a> may show off various aspects of these
        <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">elemental</a> traits. Many <a href="planes.html">planes</a> have no <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">elemental</a> or <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s
        description only when they are present.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Air-Dominant:</i> Mostly open space, <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other
        elements. They usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic
        gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a> because they have little or no
        natural earth to connect with. They take no actual <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, however.

        <i>Earth-Dominant:</i> <a href="planes.html">Planes</a> with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> the risk of <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-9">suffocation</a>
        if they don’t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals without the ability to
        burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are
        uncomfortable on earth dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a> because these <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are tight and claustrophobic to them. But they
        suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Fire-Dominant: </i><a href="planes.html">Planes</a> with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming
        their fuel source. Fire-dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are extremely hostile to Material Plane creatures, and those without
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> or immunity to fire are soon immolated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing
        unprotected flammable <a href="equipment.html#section-4-4">clothing</a> catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> every
        round they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on
        fire-dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a>. Those that are made of water take double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> each round.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Water-Dominant:</i> <a href="planes.html">Planes</a> with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a
        pocket of air will likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant
        <a href="planes.html">planes</a>. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> each round.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Positive-Dominant: </i>An abundance of life characterizes <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with this trait. The two kinds of
        positive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant
        plane is a riotous explosion of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder,
        and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> swirling through the plane. All individuals
        in a positive-dominant plane gain <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-14">fast healing</a><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6"></a> 2 as an extraordinary ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Major positive-dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a> go even further. A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15
        Fortitude save to avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the
        plane grants <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-14">fast healing</a><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6"></a> 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> gain 5 additional
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points</a> per round. These <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-7">temporary hit points </a> fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major
        positive- dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round that its temporary hit
        points exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> results in the creature exploding in a riot
        of <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>, killing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Negative-Dominant:</i> <a href="planes.html">Planes</a> with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who
        cross them. They tend to be lonely, haunted <a href="planes.html">planes</a>, drained of color and filled with winds bearing the soft
        moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a>, negative-dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a> can be either
        minor or major. On minor negative-dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a>, living creatures take 1d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> per round. At 0
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> or lower, they crumble into ash.
      </p>

      <p>
        Major negative-dominant <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are even more severe. Each round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save
        or gain a negative <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> is slain,
        becoming a <a href="monsters-t-z.html#section-18">wraith</a>. The <i>death ward </i>spell protects a traveler from the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-61">energy drain</a> of a

      <h4><a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">Alignment</a> Traits</h4>

      <p>
        Some <a href="planes.html">planes</a> have a predisposition to a certain <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. Most of the inhabitants of these <a href="planes.html">planes</a> also have the
        plane’s particular <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, even powerful creatures such as deities. In addition, creatures of alignments
        contrary to the plane have a tougher time dealing with its natives and situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who follow other alignments than
        most of the inhabitants do may find life more difficult.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">Alignment</a> traits have multiple <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic)
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>; a plane can have either a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the
        specific <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> trait indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly evident.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned: </i>These <a href="planes.html">planes</a> have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane
        can be both good-aligned and evil-aligned.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned:</i> Law versus chaos is the key struggle for these <a href="planes.html">planes</a> and their residents. No
        plane can be both law-aligned and chaos-aligned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each part of the moral/ethical <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> trait has a descriptor, either “mildly” or “strongly,” to show how
        powerful the influence of <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> is on the plane.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Mildly Aligned: </i>Creatures who have an <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a –2
        circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Strongly Aligned:</i> On <a href="planes.html">planes</a> that are strongly aligned, a –2 circumstance penalty applies on all
        Charisma-based checks made by all creatures not of the plane’s <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. In addition, the –2 penalty affects
        all Intelligence-based and Wisdom-based checks, too.
      </p>

      <p>The penalties for the moral and ethical <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> of the <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> trait do stack.</p>

      <p><i>Neutral-Aligned:</i> A mildly neutral-aligned plane does not apply a circumstance penalty to anyone.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">The Material Plane</a> is considered mildly neutral-aligned, though it may contain high concentrations of evil or
        good, law or chaos in places.
      </p>

      <p>
        A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and ethical principles: good,
        evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-3">balance</a> of the alignments than with
        accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned <a href="planes.html">planes</a>,
        strongly neutral-aligned <a href="planes.html">planes</a> apply a –2 circumstance penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based
        checks by any creature that isn’t neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for
        good/evil), so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures take a –2 penalty and
        lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a –4 penalty.
      </p>

      <h4>Magic Traits</h4>

      <p>
        A plane’s magic trait describes how magic works on the plane compared to how it works on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>.
        Particular locations on a plane (such as those under the direct control of deities) may be pockets where a
        different magic trait applies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Normal Magic:</i> This magic trait means that all <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and supernatural abilities function as written.
        Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the normal magic trait.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Wild Magic:</i> On a plane with the wild magic trait <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities function in radically
        different and sometimes dangerous ways. Any spell or spell-like ability used on a wild magic plane has a chance
        to go awry. The caster must make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> check (DC 15 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell or effect) for the magic to
        function normally. For spell-like abilities, use the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or HD of the creature employing the ability for the
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> check and the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell-like ability to set the DC for the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> check. Failure on
        this check means that something strange happens; roll d% and consult the following table.

        <i>Impeded Magic:</i> Particular <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities are more difficult to cast on <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with this
        trait, often because the nature of the plane interferes with the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        To cast an impeded spell, the caster must make a <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> check (DC 20 + the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell). If the check
        fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds,
        the spell functions normally.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Enhanced Magic:</i> Particular <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities are easier to use or more powerful in effect
        on <a href="planes.html">planes</a> with this trait than they are on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Natives of a plane with the enhanced magic trait are aware of which <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities are
        enhanced, but planar travelers may have to discover this on their own.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a spell is enhanced, certain <a href="feats.html#section-2-3">metamagic feats</a> can be applied to it without changing the spell slot required or
        the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a>. Spellcasters on the plane are considered to have that feat or <a href="feats.html">feats</a> for the purpose of
        applying them to that spell. Spellcasters native to the plane must gain the feat or <a href="feats.html">feats </a> normally if they want

        like planets in different orbits. The only way to get from one separate plane to the other is to go through a
        third plane.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Coterminous <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>:</b> <a href="planes.html">Planes</a> that touch at specific points are coterminous. Where they touch, a connection
        exists, and travelers can leave one reality behind and enter the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Coexistent <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>:</b> If a link between two <a href="planes.html">planes</a> can be created at any point, the two <a href="planes.html">planes</a> are
        coexistent. These <a href="planes.html">planes</a> overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can be reached from anywhere on the
        plane it overlaps. When moving on a coexistent plane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the
        plane it coexists with.
      </p>

      <p>Layered <a href="planes.html">Planes</a></p>

      <p>
        Infinities may be broken into smaller infinities, and <a href="planes.html">planes</a> into smaller, related <a href="planes.html">planes</a>. These layers are
        effectively separate <a href="planes.html">planes</a> of existence, and each layer can have its own <a href="planes.html#section-2">planar traits</a>. Layers are connected to
        each other through a variety of planar gates, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.
      </p>

      <p>
        Access to a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on a specific layer: the first layer of the plane,
        which can be either the top layer or the bottom layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access points
        (such as portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for other layers of the
        plane. The <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-16">plane shift</a> </i>spell also deposits the spellcaster on the first layer of the plane.

      <p><a href="planes.html#section-3-1">The Material Plane</a> is the center of most cosmologies and defines what is considered normal.</p>

      <p><a href="planes.html#section-3-1">The Material Plane</a> has the following traits:</p>

      <p>• Normal gravity.</p>

      <p>• Normal Time</p>

      <p>• Alterable morphic.</p>

      <p>• No <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">Elemental</a> or <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">Energy</a> Traits (specific locations may have these traits, however)</p>

      <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>

      <p>• Normal magic.</p>

      <h3 id="section-3-2"><a href="planes.html#section-3-2">THE ETHEREAL PLANE</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">The Ethereal Plane</a> is coexistent with <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> and often other <a href="planes.html">planes</a> as well. <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">The Material Plane</a>
        itself is visible from <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>, but it appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each
        other and its edges turning fuzzy.
      </p>

      <p>
        While it is possible to see into <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> from <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>, <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a> is usually
        invisible to those on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>. Normally, creatures on <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a> cannot attack creatures on
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, and vice versa. A traveler on <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a> is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly
        silent to someone on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">The Ethereal Plane</a> is mostly empty of structures and impediments. However, the plane has its own inhabitants.
        Some of these are other ethereal travelers, but the ghosts found here pose a particular peril to those who walk
        the fog.
      </p>

      <p>It has the following traits.</p>

      <p>• No gravity.</p>

      <p>• Alterable morphic. The plane contains little to alter, however.</p>

      <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>

      <p>
        • Normal magic. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> function normally on <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>, though they do not cross into the Material
        Plane.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only exceptions are <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities that have the force descriptor and abjuration <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>
        that affect ethereal beings. Spellcasters on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> must have some way to detect foes on the
        Ethereal Plane before targeting them with force-based <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, of course. While it’s possible to hit ethereal
        enemies with a force spell cast on <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, the reverse isn’t possible. No magical attacks cross from
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a> to <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>, including force attacks.

      <p>
        The <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a> is a dimly lit dimension that is both coterminous to and coexistent with <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>.
        It overlaps <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a> much as <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a> does, so a planar traveler can use the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a>
        to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> great distances quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a> is also coterminous to other <a href="planes.html">planes</a>. With the right spell, a character can use the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a> to visit other realities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a> is a world of black and white; color itself has been bleached from <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9">the environment</a>. It is
        otherwise appears similar to <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Despite the lack of <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> sources, various plants, animals, and humanoids call the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"> </a> home.</p>

      <p>
        The <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a> is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto other <a href="planes.html">planes</a>. As a result, creating a
        precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks.
      </p>

      <p>The <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a> has the following traits.</p>

      <p>
        • Magically morphic. Certain <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> modify the base material of the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a>. The utility and power of
        these <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> within the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a> make them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.
      </p>

      <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>

      <p>
        • Enhanced magic. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> with the <a href="monsters-s.html#section-5">shadow</a> descriptor are enhanced on the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a>. Such <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are cast as
        though they were prepared with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-68">Maximize Spell</a> feat, though they don’t require the higher spell slots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, specific <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> become more powerful on the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a>. <i>Shadow conjuration </i>and
        <i>shadow evocation </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are 30% as powerful as the conjurations and evocations they <a href="monsters-m-n.html#section-6">mimic</a> (as opposed to
        20%). <i><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5-2">Greater shadow</a><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-19"> conjuration</a> </i>and <i><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5-2">greater shadow</a><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-21"> evocation</a> </i>are 70% as powerful (not 60%), and a
        <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-18">shades</a> </i>spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original (not 80%).
      </p>

      <p>
        • Impeded magic. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that use or generate <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> or fire may fizzle when cast on the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a>. A
        spellcaster attempting a spell with the <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> or fire descriptor must succeed on a <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft </a> check (DC 20 + the
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the spell). <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that produce <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> are less effective in general, because all <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> sources have
        their ranges halved on the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite the dark nature of the <a href="planes.html#section-3-3">Plane of Shadow</a><a href="monsters-s.html#section-5"></a>, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that produce, use, or manipulate <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a> are unaffected
        by the plane.

      <h3 id="section-3-4"><a href="planes.html#section-3-4">THE ASTRAL PLANE</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">The Astral Plane</a> is the space between the <a href="planes.html">planes</a>. When a character moves through an interplanar portal or
        projects her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>. Even <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that
        allow instantaneous <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> across a plane<i> </i>briefly touch <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>.

      <p>
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">The Astral Plane</a> is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid
        matter can be found here, but most of <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a> is an endless, open domain.

      <p><a href="planes.html#section-3-4">The Astral Plane</a> has the following traits.</p>

      <p>• Subjective directional gravity.</p>

      <p>
        • Timeless. <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-2-1">Age</a>, hunger, thirst, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>, and natural <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-6">healing</a> don’t function in <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>, though they
        resume functioning when the traveler leaves <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a>.
      </p>

      <p>• Mildly neutral-aligned.</p>

      <p>
        • Enhanced magic. All <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities used within <a href="planes.html#section-3-4">the Astral Plane</a> may be employed as if they
        were improved by the <a href="feats.html#section-3-80">Quicken Spell</a> feat. Already quickened <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as
        are <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> from magic items. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. As with
        the <a href="feats.html#section-3-80">Quicken Spell</a> feat, only one quickened spell can be cast per round.

      <p>
        The <a href="planes.html#section-3-5">Elemental Plane of Air</a> is the most comfortable and survivable of the Inner <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>, and it is the home of all
        manner of airborne creatures. Indeed, flying creatures find themselves at a great advantage on this plane. While

      <p>The <a href="planes.html#section-3-5">Elemental Plane of Air</a> has the following traits.</p>

      <p>
        • Subjective directional gravity. Inhabitants of the plane determine their own “down” direction. Objects not
        under the motive force of others do not move.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite its solid, unyielding nature, the <a href="planes.html#section-3-6">Elemental Plane of Earth</a> is varied in its consistency, ranging from

        Everything is alight on the <a href="planes.html#section-3-7">Elemental Plane of Fire</a>. The ground is nothing more than great, evershifting plates
        of compressed flame. The air ripples with the heat of continual firestorms, and the most common liquid is magma,
        not water. The oceans are made of liquid flame, and the mountains <a href="monsters-o-r.html#section-3">ooze</a> with molten lava. Fire survives here
        without need for fuel or air, but flammables brought onto the plane are consumed readily.

        breathing the local medium.
      </p>

      <p>
        The eternal oceans of this plane vary between ice cold and boiling hot, between saline and fresh. They are

      <h3 id="section-3-9"><a href="planes.html#section-3-9">NEGATIVE ENERGY PLANE</a></h3>

      <p>
        To an observer, there’s little to see on the <a href="planes.html#section-3-9">Negative Energy Plane</a>. It is a dark, empty place, an eternal pit
        where a traveler can fall until the plane itself steals away all <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> and life. The <a href="planes.html#section-3-9">Negative Energy Plane</a> is
        the most hostile of the Inner <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>, and the most uncaring and intolerant of life. Only creatures immune to its
        life-draining energies can survive there.
      </p>

      <p>The <a href="planes.html#section-3-9">Negative Energy Plane</a> has the following traits.</p>

      <p>• Subjective directional gravity.</p>

      <p>
        • Major negative-dominant. Some areas within the plane have only the minor negative-dominant trait, and these
        islands tend to be inhabited.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Enhanced magic. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> and spell-like abilities that use negative <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> are maximized (as if the Maximize
        Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> don’t require higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> slots). <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> and
        spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. Class abilities that use
        negative <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>, such as rebuking and controlling undead, gain a +10 bonus on the roll to determine Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>
        affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Impeded magic. <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> and spell-like abilities that use positive <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>, including <i>cure </i><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, are
        impeded. Characters on this plane take a –10 penalty on Fortitude <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> made to remove negative levels
        bestowed by an <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-61">energy drain</a> attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        Random Encounters: Because the <a href="planes.html#section-3-9">Negative Energy Plane</a> is virtually devoid of creatures, random encounters on the
        plane are exceedingly rare.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-10"><a href="planes.html#section-3-10">POSITIVE ENERGY PLANE</a></h3>

      <p>
        The <a href="planes.html#section-3-10">Positive Energy Plane</a> has no surface and is akin to the <a href="planes.html#section-3-5">Elemental Plane of Air</a> with its wide-open nature.
        However, every bit of this plane glows brightly with innate power. This power is dangerous to mortal forms,
        which are not made to handle it. Despite the beneficial effects of the plane, it is one of the most hostile of
        the Inner <a href="planes.html">Planes</a>. An unprotected character on this plane swells with power as positive <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> is force-fed into
        her. Then, her mortal frame unable to contain that power, she immolates as if she were a small planet caught at
        the edge of a supernova. Visits to the <a href="planes.html#section-3-10">Positive Energy Plane</a> are brief, and even then travelers must be heavily
        protected.
      </p>

      <p>The <a href="planes.html#section-3-10">Positive Energy Plane</a> has the following traits.</p>

      <p>• Subjective directional gravity.</p>

      <p>
        • Major positive-dominant. Some regions of the plane have the minor positive-dominant trait instead, and those
        islands tend to be inhabited.
