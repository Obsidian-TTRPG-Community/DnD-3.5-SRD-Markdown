      <h1>SALIENT DIVINE ABILITIES</h1>

      <p>
        A salient divine ability is like a feat—it gives a deity a new capability or improves one that the deity already
        has. A deity has one salient divine ability for each divine rank the deity has, plus additional salient divine
        abilities reflecting its <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-63">status</a>: Demigods receive one bonus ability, lesser deities receive two bonus abilities,
        intermediate deities receive three, and greater deities receive five.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some salient divine abilities have <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a>. Usually, the deity must have all the listed <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a> to
        have the ability. A divine rank of 1 is a prerequisite for all salient divine abilities. The most common salient
        divine abilities are described here. A few deities have unique salient divine abilities that are described in
        the deity’s individual entry.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Using Salient Divine Abilities:</b> Using a salient divine ability is a standard action unless otherwise
        noted in the ability description. Using a salient divine ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Salient Divine Abilities and Antimagic: </b>A salient divine ability functions normally within an <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-2">antimagic</a>
        field, and is never subject to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Salient Divine Ability Descriptions</h4>

      <p>Here is the format for salient divine ability descriptions.</p>

      <h4>Ability <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-1">Name</a></h4>

      <p>
        <b>Prerequisite:</b> A minimum divine rank, minimum ability score, another salient divine ability, a minimum
        base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, a feat, a skill, or some other condition that a deity must have in order to acquire this
        salient divine ability. This entry is absent if a salient divine ability has no prerequisite. An ability may
        have more than one prerequisite. All salient divine abilities have a minimum prerequisite of divine rank 1.
        Quasi-deities (rank 0) have no salient divine abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> What the ability enables the deity to do. If a deity has the same ability more than once, its
        benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description. In general, having a salient divine ability
        twice is the same as having it once.
      </p>

      <p><b>Notes:</b> Additional facts about the ability that may be helpful when using the ability in play.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Rest: </b>Some abilities require the deity to rest afterward. If no rest is required, the entry is absent. A
        resting deity can engage in <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> activities such as talking or walking at half <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. When attempting anything
        more strenuous than that, the deity can only take partial actions and suffers a –6 penalty on all attack rolls,
        saves, and checks. The deity cannot use another ability that requires rest until its current rest requirement is
        fulfilled. Any time the deity spends performing strenuous activities does not count toward the required rest
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> This entry gives one or more portfolio elements that are associated with
        the salient divine ability in question. The information is provided as <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-54">guidance</a> and should not be taken as a
        rule.
      </p>

      <h4>Alter Form</h4>

      <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Alter Size salient divine ability.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> As a move-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including <a href="equipment.html#section-4-4">clothing </a> and <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>. The
        assumed form must be corporeal. The deity’s body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding
        or subtracting one or two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can <a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-22">fly</a>. Likewise, the deity can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim</a>
        if the form has fins, breathe water if the form has gills, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>The deity can remain in the altered form indefinitely, but resumes its own form if slain.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> The deity’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, and saves do not change. The deity does not gain any of the
        assumed form’s <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>, attack forms, defenses, <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>, or mannerisms. The deity can change
        physical qualities (such as hair color, hair
      </p>

      <p>
        texture, skin color, and gender). The deity can use this ability to create <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">disguise</a>s, gaining a bonus of +10 on
        its <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-11">Disguise</a> checks. The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously along with this one to become
        taller, shorter, thinner, or heavier.
      </p>

      <p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Nature, secrets, thieves.</p>

      <h4>Alter Reality</h4>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Cha 29.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> This ability is similar to the <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> </i>spell. The deity merely thinks of something and then
        makes it so. Doing this requires at least a standard action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> The deity can duplicate any spell of 9th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or lower as a standard action. The duplicated spell
        has no material or XP component, and the DC of its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (if one is allowed) is 20 + the deity’s rank +
        the deity’s Charisma modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity also can duplicate a spell with any metamagic feat (so long as the metamagic feat is available to
        characters of 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 round for each
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> that the feat would normally add to the spell. It still takes a standard action to use this ability, so
        there is no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect: 10
        minutes per <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> of
        creatures affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like the Create Object ability (including the
        required rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using the Create Object ability except that all
        rest requirements are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the
        deity’s own realm.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity can create temporary magic items or creatures. This works like the Divine Creation ability (including
        the required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot
        create permanent magic items or creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of
        material to be reshaped requires 1 round of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube shaped
        after the work is completed.
      </p>

      <p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Any.</p>

      <h4>Alter Size</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> As a free action, the deity can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. The deity also can change
        the size of up to 100 pounds of objects it touches. If the deity has a familiar, personal <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>, or personal
        intelligent weapon, the creature can change size with the deity if the deity touches it, but its weight counts
        against the deity’s weight limit. This is a supernatural ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> This ability allows the deity to assume any proportions from the size of a grain of sand up or as
        much as 1,600 feet tall. A radical change in size can have great impact on the deity’s combat ability. The
        deity’s Strength, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt with <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> changes according to the size the
        deity assumes. The deity’s Strength
      </p>

      <p>
        score can never be reduced to less than 1 through this ability. Also note that use of this divine ability does
        not affect all the deities’ characteristics.
      </p>

      <p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Any.</p>

      <h4>Annihilating Strike</h4>

      <p><b><a href="feats.html#section-1">Prerequisites</a>:</b> Divine rank 11, base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> +20, Str 25.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When the deity strikes with a weapon or natural weapon, the opponent struck might be
        obliterated. Creatures, attended objects, and magic items must make Fortitude saves (DC 20 + the deity’s rank +
        the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt) or be reduced to –10 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> and killed outright. Unattended, nonmagical objects are
        obliterated. The deity can destroy up to 1,000 cubic feet (a 10-foot cube) of nonliving matter per rank, so the
        ability destroys only part of any very large object or structure targeted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> Deities with a rank equal to or greater than the attacking deity are not subject to this ability.
        This ability has no effect on objects or effects that are not subject to physical attacks.
      </p>

      <p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Death, justice, vengeance, war.</p>

      <h4>Arcane Mastery</h4>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Spellcaster <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> 1st, Int 29, <a href="feats.html#section-3-94">Spell Mastery</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> The deity can prepare any <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> spell that it can cast without using a spellbook.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> This ability gives the deity access to every spell on the <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer</a>/<a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> spell list, provided
        that the deity has sufficient <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-5">wizard</a> levels and a sufficient Intelligence score to cast them. The deity also can
        invent new <a href="spell-list-ii.html#section-4">sorcerer/wizard spells</a><a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1"></a> without researching them.
      </p>

      <h4>Area Divine <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">Shield</a></h4>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Divine rank 6, Cha 29, Divine <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">Shield</a> salient divine ability.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Except where noted here, this ability works like the Divine <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">Shield</a> ability. The deity produces a
        transparent barrier whose area is up to one 10-foot square per rank, or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of
        up to 1 foot per rank. The barrier can be placed anywhere within the deity’s line of sight. The deity can place
        the barrier so that it is mobile with respect to some unattended object or willing creature. The barrier can be
        adjusted to ignore certain types of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, just as a divine <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> can. If the deity makes the <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> mobile
        with respect to a willing creature, the deity also can make the barrier
      </p>

      <p>
        one-way with respect to the creature and its allies, allowing them to attack through the <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> and still use
        its protection.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> The deity can shape the <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> around itself or around a willing creature so that it is skintight,
        which prevents the subject from being touched.
      </p>

      <p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Mercy, protection.</p>

      <h4>Automatic Metamagic</h4>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Spellcaster <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> 1st.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity chooses one metamagic feat. As a free action, the deity can apply the selected feat to
        the <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> from any one spellcasting class the deity has or to its spell-like abilities. A spell altered by the
        use of this ability does not use up a higher-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> slot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> The deity must obey all the limitations normally associated with the metamagic feat. Any metamagic
        feat selected cannot have a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> requirement of 21st or higher. <a href="feats.html">Feats</a> that depend on making the spell’s <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>
        higher, such as <a href="feats.html#section-3-44">Heighten Spell</a>, do not work with this ability. A deity can have this ability multiple times,
        choosing a metamagic feat and either a spellcasting class or spell-like abilities to which the ability will
        apply each time.
      </p>

      <h4>Avatar</h4>

      <p><b><a href="feats.html#section-1">Prerequisites</a>:</b> Divine rank 6, Cha 29.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> An avatar serves as a deity’s alter ego, effectively allowing the deity to be in two or more
        places at the same time. An avatar is an extension of a deity. The deity senses and knows everything the avatar
        senses and knows and vice versa. Each avatar counts as a remote location where the deity is sensing and
        communicating. A lesser deity can have up to five avatars at once, an intermediate deity can have up to ten, and
        a greater deity can have up to twenty avatars at once. It takes a deity one year to create an avatar or replace
        a destroyed avatar. The process does not require any special effort on the deity’s
      </p>

      <p>
        part. An avatar must be created in the deity’s own realm. If the deity has the Divine Creation salient divine
        ability, the deity can use it to create a new avatar anywhere. However, the deity must rest afterward as noted
        in the Divine Creation ability description. An avatar is a less powerful version of a deity, created by
        modifying the deity’s statistics, that has the following characteristics.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Divine Rank: </i>The avatar’s divine rank is half that of the deity (round down). This decrease in divine
        rank affects many of the avatar’s statistics and abilities, including bonuses to attack rolls, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, saves,
        checks, and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>, resistances, number of salient divine abilities and bonus salient
        divine abilities, uses per day of domain powers, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> DCs against spell-like abilities, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of senses,
        automatic actions, magic items it can create, and extent of divine aura. The deity’s <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>,
        class levels, and Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> are unchanged.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Divine Abilities: </i>The avatar has salient divine abilities according to its own divine rank. The deity
        chooses which of its abilities the avatar has when creating the avatar. The avatar cannot have a salient divine
        ability that is not available to a deity of its own rank,
      </p>

      <p>
        nor can it use a salient divine ability if it doesn’t meet the <a href="feats.html#section-1">prerequisites</a>. An avatar cannot have the Avatar
        or Possess Mortal salient divine abilities.
      </p>

      <p>An avatar does not have any remote sensing or remote communication powers.</p>

      <h4>Banestrike</h4>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> +20.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Any weapon the deity weilds gains a bonus of +4 on attack rolls, and it deals an extra +4d6
        points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> against the designated foe. The bonus and extra <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> stack with any other properties the
        weapon has.

        The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a melee weapon or ranged weapon. The deity can
        apply the Banestrike ability to any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a spell, spell-like ability,
        supernatural ability, or divine ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of foe each time. The deity can imbue
        only one <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-32">bane</a> special ability to a weapon at a time and can change among them once a round as a free action.

        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity cannot be surprised or flanked except by a deity of higher rank. The deity retains its

      <h4>Call Creatures</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The kind of creature the deity can call is noted in the deity’s description. Each creature
        called can have no more Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> than the deity has divine ranks, and the deity cannot have more creatures
        serving it at any given time than the deity has ranks. The creatures are transported to the deity’s presence
        through an interdimensional connection similar to that created by a <i>gate </i>spell, except that it opens to
        <a href="planes.html#section-3-1">the Material Plane</a>. The creatures willingly serve to the best of their ability. The calling effect is otherwise
        similar
      </p>

      <p>to the calling property of the <i><a href="spells-f-g.html#section-0-35">gate</a> </i>spell.</p>

      <p>

        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity can see illusions, transmuted creatures and objects, and disguised creatures or
        objects for what they really are, provided they are within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity. This ability is
        similar to the <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-23">true seeing</a> </i>spell, except that it does not reveal creatures’ alignments and it does foil
        mundane disguises.

      <h4><a href="spells-c.html#section-0-26">Command Plants</a></h4>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity can make plants grow in a radius of up to one mile per divine rank once per day. The
        deity can use this ability even in a place where no plants grow, though in this case the plants wither and die
        after one day. This ability works like the <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-17">plant growth</a> </i>spell, except that it cannot be countered except
        by a deity of higher rank than the deity using the ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also once per day, the deity can charm plant creatures, <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-16">animate plants</a>, or make them <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-65">entangle</a> its foes. This
        ability functions like the <i>command plants </i>spell, except that its maximum <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> is one day no matter
        which option the deity chooses. At any one time, the deity can charm a number of plant creatures equal to its
        divine rank with this ability, regardless of Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>.

      <h4>Control Creatures</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity can <a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a> some kind of creature as noted in the deity’s description. This ability is
        similar to the <i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-52">dominate monster</a> </i>spell, but it is not a mind-affecting ability (the deity seizes direct
        control over the creature’s body). Each day the deity can attempt to control a number of creature equal to its
        divine rank. The deity can attempt to take control of that number all at once, or in smaller numbers. All
        creatures to
      </p>

      <p>
        be affected must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. Once control is established, distance
        is not a factor and the deity can maintain control remotely, even across <a href="planes.html">planes</a> and through wards or barriers
        (except divine shields and warding <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> cast by deities of higher rank than the deity using the ability). The
        subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s rank + the deity’s Charisma modifier) to resist and is
        allowed a
      </p>

      <p>new save if the deity commands the subject to do something against its nature.</p>

      <p>
        At any given time, the deity cannot have more creatures under its control than 10 times its divine rank. If the
        deity already has the maximum number of creatures under its control, it can still attempt to take control of
        other creatures, but must first release
      </p>

      <p>one or more creatures already under its control.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> This ability has several benefits:</p>

      <p>
        • For the deity’s bardic abilities that have a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> (countersong, <i>fascinate, </i>inspire competence, inspire
        greatness), that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> is a number of miles equal to the deity’s divine rank.
      </p>

      <p>
        • The deity can use any bardic music inspiration ability as a standard action. The inspiration takes effect
        immediately after the deity concludes the action.
      </p>

      <p>
        • The deity’s bardic music abilities can affect even those normally immune to mind-affecting effects. However,
        such creatures gain a +10 bonus on their Will saves to resist such effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        • The effects of all the deity’s bardic music abilities are doubled. Inspire courage grants a +8 morale bonus on
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> against charm and <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> effects and a +8 morale bonus on attack and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls; inspire
        competence grants a +4 competence bonus on <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>; inspire greatness grants +4d10 Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>, a +4
        competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and inspire heroics grants a +8
        morale bonus on <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> and a +8 <a href="feats.html#section-3-27">dodge</a> bonus to AC. The number of allies the deity can affect with inspire
        competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics doubles. When inspiring competence in multiple allies, the
        deity can choose different skills to inspire for different allies.
      </p>

      <p>
        • The effects of the deity’s bardic music inspiration abilities last for ten times as long as normal after the
        deity stops singing. This has no effect on inspiration abilities that have no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a> after the <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-2">bard</a> stops
        singing.
      </p>

      <p>
        • When any effect that is subject to countersong (any spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like effect that has
        the sonic or language-dependent desriptor) occurs within the deity’s hearing, the deity can attempt a
        countersong as if it had prepared an action to do so.

        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma bonus. The
        ray created can extend up to one mile per rank (the deity chooses the length). Targets the ray strikes take 1d12
        points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> per rank of the deity, plus 1d12
      </p>

      <p>
        points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> per point of Charisma bonus the deity has. There is no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>, but the deity must make a
        ranged touch attack to hit a target. The deity can make the ray look, sound, smell, and feel like any-thing it
        desires. Despite the appearance of the ray,
      </p>

      <p>
        the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> it deals results directly from <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-50">divine power</a> and is therefore not subject to being reduced by
        <i>protection from elements </i>and similar magic.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> The ray destroys a <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-38">wall of force</a>, <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-29">prismatic wall</a>, </i>or <i><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-27">prismatic sphere</a> </i>it hits (all
        layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed). The ray itself is unaffected and can strike a target behind the
        <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-38">wall of force</a> </i>or prismatic effect.

        is up to 100 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 20 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this
        ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its
      </p>

      <p>
        own godly realm, double the volume and weight the deity can create. If the deity’s realm is located on a
        divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.
      </p>

      <p><b>Notes:</b> This ability works like the Create Greater Object ability, except as noted below.</p>

      <p>
        A deity can use this ability to create any kind of creature that does not have a divine rank. The deity can
        create a creature with class levels, but never with more class levels than the deity has itself or the deity’s

        Rating for each creature created, with a minimum of 10 minutes per creature. If the creature has class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s,

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Dex 29.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Any physical attack or individually targeted spell directed at the deity has a percent miss
        chance equal to 50 + the deity’s rank. Area effects that include the deity have a similar chance to be
        ineffective.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> The ability is similar to the <i>blink </i>spell, except that it is defensive only and the deity
        does not move to <a href="planes.html#section-3-2">the Ethereal Plane</a>, but simply exits from reality for a brief moment. This ability never
        interferes with the deity’s own attacks. If an attack overcomes the miss chance, the deity still gets the

      </p>

      <p>emotional state induced.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Courage: </i>The enchanted creatures become immune to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> effects and receive a +2 morale bonus on attack
        rolls, weapon <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> rolls, <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a>, and Will saves.

      <p>
        <i>Despair: </i>The enchanted creatures are affected as by an improved version of the

      <p>
        <i>Dread: </i>The enchanted creatures must make successful Wisdom checks (DC = the deity’s divine rank) to

        creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a –4 penalty to Wisdom, and a –2 penalty to AC.
        Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank) to resist the effect.
        This is a mind-affecting compulsion.

        use it a number of times per day equal to its divine rank. Once used, the ability lasts 1 hour (though the deity

        The deity can flank or catch flat-footed any opponent whose divine rank does not exceed the deity’s and can
        sneak attack that opponent. The deity cannot deal sneak attack <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to opponents that are immune to critical
        hits. Any time the deity inflicts <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> with a sneak attack, that target suffers <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> equal to the deity’s
        sneak <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>
      </p>

      <p><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on the deity’s next turn as well.</p>

        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity chooses one school of magic. The save DC for any spell of that school increases by

      </p>

      <p>
        on Table: Divine Spellcasting. The numbers on that table represent one spell per day at each spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> above

      <p>
        bonus <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> based on the key ability score. The deity can use these slots for <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells </a> prepared or cast with a

      <h4>Spell Slots Above 9th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a></h4>

      <p>
        The Divine Spellcasting ability grants deities access to spell slots above 9th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level </a> (which can be used to hold
        lower-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> or <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> whose <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> has been increased above 9th by the use of <a href="feats.html#section-2-3">metamagic feats</a>). The number
        of spell slots available to a deity depends on the deity’s key ability score (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom
        for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers, and Charisma for bards and sorcerers), as shown on Table: Divine
        Spellcasting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though the table only includes <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, the progression
        continues infinitely in both directions. For <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores </a> beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>,
        expand the table to follow the same patterns

      <p>as shown.</p>

      <p>
        The numbers on this table include bonus <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> that a deity receives for having a sufficiently high ability
        score, as well as one additional spell of each <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> at which the deity gains at least one bonus spell. This

      <h4>Divine Splendor</h4>

      <p><b><a href="feats.html#section-1">Prerequisites</a>:</b> Divine rank 16, Cha 26.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Any mortal who approaches within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity in its natural form dies
        immediately, with no <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Supreme.</p>

      <h4>Divine Storm</h4>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Divine rank 11.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity can surround itself with a vortex of holy or unholy force that manifests in different
        forms depending on the deity. The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per
        divine rank. The effect stops attacks with thrown <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and projectiles (they fail if made by creatures inside
        the area, or targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area).
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, the force expels creatures whose <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> on the ethical (lawful-chaotic) axis is opposite the
        deity’s. If the deity’s ethical <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> is neutral (neutral good or neutral evil), the force does not expel
        any creatures. Affected creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier +
        the deity’s divine rank) or be picked up and thrown out, regardless of size. Such creatures suffer 1d6 points of
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> for each 10 feet they travel. Creatures that make successful saves are not affected by the vortex for one
        day, although the vortex still stops their thrown <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> and projectiles. Creatures that fail their saves can
        attempt to reenter the area, but must attempt new saves.
      </p>

      <p>
        The force <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>s creatures whose <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> on the moral (good-evil) axis is opposite the deity’s. If the
        deity’s moral <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> is neutral (lawful neutral or chaotic neutral), the force does not <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> any creatures.
        Affected creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s
        divine rank) each round or suffer 1 point of holy <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> per divine rank. A successful save negates the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>,
        but the creature must save again the next round if it is still within the area.
      </p>

      <p>Creatures whose <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> is diametrically opposed to the deity’s are subject to both effects.</p>

      <h4>Divine Water Mastery</h4>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> <a href="spell-list-i.html#section-3-22">Water domain</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity gains a competence bonus on attack, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class </a> equal to its divine rank
        if both the deity and its foe are touching the same body of water.
      </p>

      <p>The deity gains a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">swim</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> commensurate with its size (see Divine Characteristics).</p>

      <p>
        At will, as a full-round action, the deity can create a devastating tidal wave of water. On land, the wave has
        effects similar to a flash flood: Creatures caught in the water must
      </p>

      <p>make a Fortitude save (DC 15). Large or smaller creatures that fail the save are swept</p>

      <p>away, taking 1d6 points of subdual <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> per round (1d3 points on a successful</p>

      <p>
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-19">Swim</a> check against DC 20). Huge creatures that fail are knocked down, while Gar-gantuan and Colossal creatures
        are checked. The wave destroys all wooden buildings and
      </p>

      <p>
        25% of the stone buildings it comes into contact with. At sea, the tidal wave capsizes ships and crushes them to
        splinters. The wave affects a number of miles of coastland up to the deity’s divine rank.
      </p>

      <p>
        When touching water, the deity can automatically sense the location of anything within 10 feet per divine rank
        that is in contact with the same body of water.

      <h4>Divine <a href="feats.html#section-3-108">Weapon Focus</a></h4>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> This ability works like the <a href="feats.html#section-3-108">Weapon Focus</a> feat except that the deity receives a bonus of +4 on
        attacks with the weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> This bonus stacks with the divine rank bonus deities get on attack rolls, and with the Divine
        Weapon Mastery salient divine ability. It also stacks with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-108">Weapon Focus</a> and <a href="feats.html#section-3-42">Greater Weapon Focus</a><a href="feats.html#section-3-108"></a> <a href="feats.html">feats</a>.

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity receives the benefits of the <a href="feats.html#section-3-108">Weapon Focus</a>, <a href="feats.html#section-3-109">Weapon Specialization</a>, and Improved
        Critical <a href="feats.html">feats</a> when wielding any simple or martial weapon.
      </p>

      <h4>Divine <a href="feats.html#section-3-109">Weapon Specialization</a></h4>

        weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> This ability works like the <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-5">fighter</a>’s <a href="feats.html#section-3-109">Weapon Specialization</a> feat, except that the deity receives
        a bonus on <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> with the weapon equal to its divine rank.

        immediate target, become shaken for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Creatures the deity attacks when it
        activates the ability become panicked for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Foes who make successful saving
        throws are unaffected by this ability for one day.

      <p>
        This ability can restore a creature to life against its will, but only with the permission of whatever deity
        rules the underworld or the divine realm where the mortal’s soul resides. This ability can resurrect an

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity points to any mortal within the deity’s sensory <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> and snuffs out its life. There
        must be an unbroken line of effect between the deity and the target.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> This ability works like the <i>destruction </i>spell, except that there is no material component.
        The mortal is allowed a Fortitude <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> with a DC of 20 + the deity’s Charisma bonus + the deity’s divine
        rank. Even if the save succeeds, the subject takes 10d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, which may kill it anyway. If the
        attack kills the mortal (either through a failed <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> or through <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>), the mortal cannot be raised or

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> A deity can have this ability multiple times, and its effects stack. A deity with two applications

      </p>

      <p>
        The deity’s attacks with the chosen <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> are considered to be adamantine for purposes of bypassing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>

        other type of performance as a full-round action, the deity has the option to create any of the following
        effects. The deity can use this ability a number of times per

        feet per divine rank, centered on the deity.

      <p>
        • Affected creatures become unable to take actions; instead, they dance, observe the performance with rapt
        attention, laugh, or applaud at the deity’s option. The affected creatures also suffer a –4 penalty to <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a>
        Class, cannot succeed at Reflex saves (except on a roll of 20), and cannot use shields. Creatures can resist
        this mind effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank).
        The effects last for as long as the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank thereafter.

        created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity and any such effects already operating on affected
        creatures are countered and dispelled. This ability also counters and dispels <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-45">rage</a> effects except for those
        created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity. Immunity to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear </a> and compulsion last for as long as
        the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Affected creatures fall asleep. This works like the <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> </i>spell, except that any living creature can be
        affected. Creatures can resist this mind effect with Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the
        deity’s divine rank). Affected creatures <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep </a> for up to 1 hour per divine rank or until awakened. The deity can
        end the effect at will.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Affected creatures are so deeply moved that they simply die. Only living creatures with Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> equal to or
        less than the deity’s divine rank are affected. Creatures can resist the effect with Fortitude saves (DC 10 +

      </p>

      <p>
        Once a creature makes a successful save against one of the deity’s performances, the creature cannot be affected
        again for one day.

        deity must unambiguously <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> the subject in some fashion. If the deity chooses to kill a mortal, the
        ability works like the

        <i>destruction </i>spell, except that there is no material component or <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>. The mortal cannot be
        raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life or Life and
        Death salient divine ability.

      <p>
        If the deity restores life to a mortal, this ability works like the <i><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-22">true resurrection</a> </i>spell, except that
        there is no material component and the amount of time the subject has been dead is irrelevant.
      </p>

        This ability cannot restore a creature to life against its will, but it can resurrect an <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">elemental</a> or outsider.
        It can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher rank than
        the one using this ability.

        gain two negative levels (the save DC to remove the negative levels is the same as the first Will save). A
        single creature can be drained by the cloud only once per day, but the cloud’s <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a> remains effective.

        The deity can make plants and animals sentient, and it can reduce sentient creatures to animal or plant form.

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity can grant humanlike sentience to trees or animals. This sentience lasts a maximum of
        one day, and the sentient tree or animal obeys the deity’s commands to the best of its ability. The deity can
        affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the
        deity’s line of sight when first affected.

        Also, the deity can transmute any creature into a plant or animal of approximately the same size or up to two
        size categories smaller. The subject is allowed a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the
        deity’s divine rank) to resist. Subjects

      <h4>Possess Mortal</h4>

      <p><b><a href="feats.html#section-1">Prerequisites</a>:</b> Cha 29.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity can possess any mortal in any location the deity can sense. Unwilling mortals can
        attempt Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s rank).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> that prevent possession block this ability if the mortal is unwilling. Likewise, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>
        that end possession drive out the deity if the mortal is unwilling. If the mortal is willing, however, the deity
        cannot be blocked or driven out, except by a divine
      </p>

      <p><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> or the use of the Alter Reality salient divine ability by a deity of higher rank.</p>

      <p>
        The possessed mortal effectively becomes an avatar of the deity. The deity can draw on all the possessed
        mortal’s memories, and the deity senses what the mortal senses. Each mortal possessed counts as a remote
        location where the deity is sensing and communicating. A demigod can possess up to two mortals at a time, a
        lesser deity can possess up to five mortals at once, an intermediate deity can possess up to ten, and a greater
        deity can possess up to twenty mortals at once.
      </p>

      <p>While the deity is in possession, the mortal’s abilities are unchanged, except as noted below.</p>

      <p><i>Type: </i>Same as the deity.</p>

      <p><i><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">Hit Points</a>: </i>Same as the mortal, +1 for each rank of the deity.</p>

      <p>
        <i><a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">Ability Scores</a>: </i>Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are unchanged. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
        become 5 points lower than the deity’s (or remain as the mortal’s scores if they are higher).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Saves: </i>Fortitude and Reflex same as the mortal; Will adjusted if necessary for the mortal’s new Wisdom
        score.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Skills: </i>The mortal can use its own skills and the deity’s skills. If the mortal and the deity have the
        same skill, use the skill of whichever has more ranks in the skill. Use the mortal’s effective <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a> to

        the deity can perceive. The deity also can enchant creatures so they become truthful. The deity can affect up to
        one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line
        of sight when first affected. The enchanted creatures become unable to utter any deliberate falsehoods or
        evasions of truth for one day. The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the
        deity’s divine rank) to resist. Subjects who make successful saves become immune to this ability for one day.

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When the deity suffers an attack that should destroy it, it simply disperses and reassembles
        later. Roll 10d10 to determine the number of days before the deity returns.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> If the deity is killed in its own realm, subtract the deity’s divine rank from the number of days
        it takes to return. If the deity’s realm is on a divinely morphic Outer Plane, and the deity is killed there,
        subtract twice the deity’s divine rank from
      </p>

      <p>the number of days it takes to return. The return always takes at least one day.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> This ability is similar to a constant <i>greater arcane sight </i>spell, except that it covers
        the whole area the deity can see, and the deity immediately knows the number of auras present along with their

        monstrous humanoid, or plant. The assumed form must be both living and corporeal. The deity can remain in the

        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity can assume the form of another creature. The forms a deity can assume are limited and
        vary with each deity. The forms allowed are listed in the deity’s description. The deity can remain in the

      </p>

      <p>resumes its own form if slain.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> The deity acquires the physical, natural, and extraordinary abilities of the form it has assumed
        (but not spell-like or supernatural abilities) while retaining its own mind. Physical abilities include natural
        size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>, natural <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> (such as
        claws, bite, swoop and rake, and constriction; but not petrification, breath <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-61">energy drain</a>, <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>
        effect, and the like), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of
        extremities, and so on). A body with extra limbs does not allow the deity to make more attacks (or more
        advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> capabilities, such
        as walking, swimming, and flight with wings. The deity’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> is that of the assumed form or the deity’s normal
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, whichever is higher.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, any part of the body or piece of <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> that is separated from the whole reverts to its original
        form. However, if the assumed form has an extraordinary ability that allows it to produce a substance or shed
        part of its body, then this ability also grants that ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> and class, <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (despite any change
        in its Constitution score), <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and
        Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The deity retains its outsider type,
        extraordinary abilities, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity also retains its divine <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a> bonus and divine qualities and abilities, provided they are not
        supernatural.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deity can cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> for which it has <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>. It needs a voice like that of a humanoid for verbal
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> and hands like those of a humanoid for somatic <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>, Likewise, the deity needs hands to use
        many of its powers, such as creating objects related to its portfolio.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the shape shift occurs, the deity’s <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is
        a creature that does not use <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a> (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, <a href="monsters-e-f.html#section-2">elemental</a>,

      <p>
        Material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>. If the new form uses <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>

        <b>Benefit:</b> The deity’s <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> is doubled on the local or overland scales. Also, having this ability means
        that the deity’s height does not limit the distance it can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-4">jump</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, the deity can impart extra overland <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> to living creatures. The deity can affect up to one
        creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of

        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> result anyone else in an encounter or battle has.

        <b>Notes:</b> Determine <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> normally among any beings who don’t have this ability, placing them in order
        after the deity. The deity can choose to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a> or <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> an action, just any other being can, and doing so
        changes the deity’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> as normal. The deity also can refocus, thereby resuming its position at the
        beginning of the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> order.
      </p>

      <p>
        If two or more deities who have this ability are in the same battle, the deity with the highest divine rank gets
        the first position in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> order, the deity with the second highest rank gets the second position, and
        so on. Other beings then go in order after the last deity with the Supreme <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">Initiative</a> ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        If two deities with this ability and the same divine rank are in a battle, make an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> check for each

      <p>
        wounds for 2d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> per round, and so on). The bleeding can only be stopped by a successful <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-1">Heal</a>

        <b>Notes:</b> The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a physical weapon. The ability

        to be aware of the mere presence of absence of the things detected, but you must still concentrate to gain
        additional information as normal.&nbsp; <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> on such a spell is a standard action that does not provoke
        an attack of opportunity.&nbsp; A <a href="divine-abilities-and-feats.html#section-2-12">persistent spell</a> uses up a spell slot six <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s higher than the spell’s

        you must be able to speak with it via a <i><a href="spells-s.html#section-0-51">speak with plants</a> </i>effect, though it may do so mentally if
        desired. This ability is usable a total number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You use

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can turn (but not destroy) plant creatures as a good <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> turns undead. When determining
        the result of a turning attempt, treat all <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-16">destruction</a> results as normal turning. Treat immobile plant creatures

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You may cast a spell that normally has a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of touch at any distance up to 30 feet. The spell
        effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed at a ranged touch attack to bestow the spell upon the recipient.
        A <a href="divine-abilities-and-feats.html#section-2-16">reach spell</a> uses up a spell slot two <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s higher than the spell’s actual <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.

      <p><b><a href="feats.html#section-1">Prerequisites</a>:</b> Any other metamagic feat.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next round of actions. No
        matter where you are, the secondary spell originates from the same location and affects the same area as the
        primary spell. If the repeated spell
      </p>

      <p>
        designates a target, the secondary spell retargets the same target if the target is within 30 feet of its
        original position; otherwise the secondary spell fails to go off. A repeated spell uses up a spell slot three
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s higher than the spell’s actual <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. <a href="divine-abilities-and-feats.html#section-2-17">Repeat Spell</a> cannot be used on <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> with a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of touch.

        not subject to being reduced by protection from elements or similar magic. The other half of the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt by
