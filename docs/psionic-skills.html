      <p>
        <i>Ignore Caltrop Wound: </i>If you are wounded by stepping on a caltrop, your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> is reduced to one-half
        normal. A successful <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> check removes this <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> penalty. The wound doesn’t go away—it is just
        ignored through self-persuasion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Memorize: </i>You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or some other
        particularly difficult piece of information (but you can’t memorize magical writing or similarly exotic
        scripts). Each successful check allows you to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words), numbers,
        diagrams, or sigils (even if you don’t recognize their meaning). If a document is longer than one page, you can
        make additional checks for each additional page. You always retain this information; however, you can recall it
        only with another successful <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Resist Dying: </i>You can attempt to subconsciously prevent yourself from dying. If you have negative <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> and are losing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (at 1 per round, 1 per hour), you can substitute a DC 15 <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis </a> check for
        your d% roll to see if you become stable. If the check is successful, you stop losing <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (you do not
        gain any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, however, as a result of the check). You can substitute this check for the d% roll in later
        rounds if you are initially unsuccessful.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Resist Fear: </i>In response to any <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> effect, you make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> normally. If you fail the saving
        throw, you can make an <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> check on your next round even while overcome by <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>. If your <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">autohypnosis</a>
        check meets or beats the DC for the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> effect, you shrug off the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a>. On a failed check, the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> affects you
        normally, and you gain no further attempts to shrug off that particular <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-15">fear</a> effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Tolerate Poison: </i>You can choose to substitute an <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> check for a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> against any
        standard <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>’s secondary <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> or effect. This skill has no effect on the initial <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw </a> against
        <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-24">poison</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Willpower: </i>If reduced to 0 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> (disabled), you can make an <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> check. If successful, you
        can take a normal action while at 0 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> without taking 1 point of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. You must make a check for each
        strenuous action you want to take. A failed <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> check in this circumstance carries no direct
        penalty—you can choose not to take the strenuous action and thus avoid the hit point loss. If you do so anyway,
        you drop to –1 <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, as normal when disabled.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> None. Making an <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free action (when
        attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Try Again: </b>Yes, for memorize and willpower uses, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a
        previous failure. No for the other uses.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Synergy: </b>If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a>, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-3">Knowledge (psionics) </a> checks.
      </p>

      <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a>, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> checks.</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-2"><a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">CONCENTRATION</a> <small>(CON)</small></h3>

      <p>You are particularly good at focusing your mind.</p>

      <p>The following are additional uses for the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">concentration</a> skill.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Check:</b> You must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, by harsh <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-8-10">weather</a>, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such
        actions include manifesting a power, concentrating on an active power, directing a power, or using a psi-like
        ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check succeeds, you can continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action
        automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> are lost.
        If you were concentrating on an active power, the power ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you
        were directing a power, the direction fails but the power remains active. If you were using a psi-like ability,
        that use of the ability is lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration </a> check. If the
        distraction occurs while you are trying to manifest a power, you must add the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the power you are trying
        to manifest to the appropriate <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> DC.

        <i>Gain Psionic Focus: </i>Merely holding a reservoir of psionic <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> in mind gives psionic characters a
        special <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>. Psionic characters can put that <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> to work without actually paying a power point cost—they
        can become psionically focused as a special use of the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> skill.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have 1 or more <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> available, you can meditate to attempt to become psionically focused. The DC
        to become psionically focused is 20. Meditating is a full-round action that provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
        When you are psionically focused, you can expend your focus on any single <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check you make
        thereafter. When you expend your focus in this manner, your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check is treated as if you rolled a
        15. It’s like taking 10, except that the number you add to your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> modifier is 15. You can also
        expend your focus to gain the benefit of a psionic feat—many <a href="psionic-feats.html">psionic feats</a> are activated in this way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you are psionically focused, you remain focused until you expend your focus, become unconscious, or go to
        <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-40">sleep</a> (or enter a meditative trance, in the case of <a href="psionic-races.html#section-3">elans</a>), or until your power point reserve drops to 0.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Usually none. In most cases, making a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check doesn’t require an action; it is either
        a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively). Meditating to
        gain psionic focus is a full-round action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Try Again:</b> Yes, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure, such as the loss of
        the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> for a power being manifested or the disruption of a power being concentrated on.
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Emulate an Ability Score: </i>To manifest a power from a power stone, you need a high ability score in the
        appropriate ability. Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to
        manifest the power from the power stone) is your check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score
        in the appropriate ability, you don’t need to make this check.

        <i>Emulate an Alignment: </i>Some <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> have positive or negative effects based on your <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>. Use

        <i>Emulate a Class Feature: </i>Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a psionic item. Your
        effective <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in the emulated class equals your check result minus 20. This skill does not let you use the
        class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had the class feature.

      <p>
        <i>Use a Dorje: </i>Normally, to use a dorje, you must have the dorje’s power on your class power list. This use
        of the skill allows you to use a dorje as if you had a particular power on your class power list. This use of
        the skill applies to other power trigger <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>, if applicable.

      <p>
        <i>Use a Power Stone: </i>Normally, to manifest a power from a power stone, you must have the power stone’s
        power on your class power list. This use of the skill allows you to use a power stone as if you had a particular
        power on your class power list. The DC is equal to 20 + the <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> of the power you are trying to
