      <h1><a href="epic-level-basics.html">EPIC LEVEL BASICS</a></h1>

      <p>
        Epic characters—those whose character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is 21st or higher—are handled slightly differently from nonepic
        characters. While epic characters continue to receive most of the benefits of gaining levels, some benefits are
        replaced by alternative gains. A class can be advanced beyond 20<sup>th</sup> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.&nbsp; A ten-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> prestige
        class can progress beyond 10<sup>th</sup> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, but only if the character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is already 20<sup>th</sup> or
        higher.&nbsp; A class with fewer than ten <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s cannot progress beyond the maximum for that class, regardless
        of character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Epic Save Bonus:</b> A character’s base save bonus does not increase after character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> reaches 20th.
        However, the character does receive a cumulative +1 epic bonus on all <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> at every even-numbered <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>
        beyond 20th, as shown on Table: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonuses. Any time a feat, prestige class, or other
        rule refers to your base save bonus, use the sum of your base save bonus and epic save bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Epic Attack Bonus:</b> Similarly, the character’s base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> does not increase after character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>
        reaches 20th. However, the character does receive a cumulative +1 epic bonus on all attacks at every
        odd-numbered <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> beyond 20th, as shown on Table: Epic Save and Epic <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">Attack Bonus</a>es. Any time a feat, prestige
        class, or other rule refers to your base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>, use the sum of your base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> and epic attack
        bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Class Skill Max Ranks:</b> The maximum number of ranks a character can have in a class skill is equal to his
        or her character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> +3.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Cross-Class Skill Max Ranks:</b> For cross-class skills, the maximum number of ranks is one-half the maximum
        for a class skill.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="feats.html">Feats</a>: Every character gains one feat (which may be an epic or nonepic feat at the player’s choice) at every
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> divisible by three. These <a href="feats.html">feats</a> are in addition to any bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a> granted in the class descriptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ability Increases: Upon gaining any <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> divisible by four, a character increases one of his or her ability
        scores by 1 point. The player chooses which ability score to improve. For <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-6">multiclass characters</a>, <a href="feats.html">feats</a> and
        ability increases are gained according to character <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, not class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.

      <p>
        Although most of the tables only show information up to a certain <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> (often 30th), that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> is by no means
        the limit of a character’s advancement. It can be generally assumed that any patterns on a particular table
        continue infinitely.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-1"><a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">CLASS FEATURES</a></h3>

      <p>
        Many, but not all, <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> continue to accumulate after 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The following guidelines describe how
        the epic class progressions.
      </p>

      <p>
        • A character’s base save bonuses and base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> don’t increase after 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. Use Table: Epic Save
        and Epic Attack Bonuses to determine the character’s epic bonus on <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> and attacks.
      </p>

      <p>• Characters continue to gain Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> and skill points as normal beyond 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.</p>

      <p>
        • Generally, any class feature that uses class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> as part of a mathematical formula continues to increase
        using the character’s class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> in the formula.&nbsp; Any prestige class feature that calculates a save DC
        using the class <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> should add only half the character’s class levels above 10th.
      </p>

      <p>
        • For spellcasters, <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> continues to increase after 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. However, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> per day don’t increase
        after 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The only way to gain additional <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> per day (other than the bonus <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells </a> gained from a high
        ability score) is to select the <a href="epic-feats.html#section-4-86">Improved Spell Capacity</a> epic feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        • The powers of familiars, special mounts, and fiendish servants continue to increase as their masters gain
        levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Any <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> that increase or accumulate as part of a repeated pattern also continues to increase or
        accumulate after 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> at the same rate.&nbsp; An exception to this rule is any bonus feat granted as a
        class feature. If a character gets bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a> as part of a class feature, these do not increase with epic
        levels. Instead, these classes get bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a> at a different rate (described in each epic class description).
      </p>

      <p>
        • In addition to the <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> retained from nonepic <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s, each class gains a bonus feat every two,
        three, four, or five <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s after 20th. This augments each class’s progression of <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a>, because not
        all classes otherwise improve <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> after 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. A character must select these <a href="feats.html">feats </a> from the list
        of bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a> for that class. These bonus <a href="feats.html">feats</a> are in addition to the feat that every character gets every
        three levels. The character isn’t limited to selecting from the class list when selecting these <a href="feats.html">feats</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Characters don’t gain any new <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a>, because there aren’t any new <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> described for these
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s. <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">Class features</a> with a progression that slows or stops before 20th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> and features that have a limited
        list of options do not improve as a character gains epic <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>s. Likewise, <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> that are gained only
        at a single <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> do not improve.
      </p>

      <h4>Adding a Second Class</h4>

      <p>
        When a single-class epic character gains a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, he or she may choose to increase the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of his or her
        current class or pick up a new class at 1st <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. The standard rules for <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-6">multiclass characters</a> still apply, but
        epic characters must keep in mind the rules for epic advancement. The epic character gains all the 1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>
        class skills, weapon proficiency, <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> proficiency, <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>, and other <a href="epic-level-basics.html#section-0-1">class features</a> of the new class, as well
        as a Hit Die of the appropriate type. In addition, the character gets the usual skill points from the new class.
        Just as with standard multiclassing, adding the second class does not confer some of the benefits for a
        1st-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> character, including maximum <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a> from the first Hit Die, quadruple the per-<a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> skill points,
        starting <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>, starting gold, or an animal companion. An epic character does not gain the base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a>es and base save bonuses normally gained when adding a second class. Instead, an epic character uses the
        epic <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> and epic save bonus progression shown on Table: Epic Save and Epic <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">Attack Bonus</a>.
