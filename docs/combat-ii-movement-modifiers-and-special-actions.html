        Miniatures are on the 30mm scale—a miniature figure of a six-foot-tall human is approximately 30mm tall. A
        square on the battle grid is 1 inch across, representing a 5-foot-by-5-foot area.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-1"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-1-1">TACTICAL MOVEMENT</a></h3>

      <h4>How Far Can Your Character Move?</h4>

      <p>
        Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> is determined by your race and your <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> (see Table: Tactical <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">Speed</a>). Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> while unarmored is
        your base land <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Encumbrance:</b> A character encumbered by carrying a large amount of gear, <a href="treasure.html">treasure</a>, or fallen comrades may
        move slower than normal.
      </p>

      <p><b>Hampered <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a>:</b> Difficult terrain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Movement in Combat:</b> Generally, you can move your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> in a round and still do something (take a move
        action and a standard action).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do nothing but move (that is, if you use both of your actions in a round to move your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>), you can
        move double your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you spend the entire round running, you can move quadruple your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. If you do something that requires a
        full round you can only take a 5-foot step.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonuses to Speed:</b> A <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-1">barbarian</a> has a +10 foot bonus to his <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (unless he’s wearing heavy <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a>).
        Experienced monks also have higher <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (unless they’re wearing <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> of any sort). In addition, many <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>
        and magic items can affect a character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>. Always apply any modifiers to a character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> before
        adjusting the character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> based on <a href="equipment.html#section-3">armor</a> or encumbrance, and remember that multiple bonuses of the same
        type to a character’s <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> don’t stack.

      <h4>Measuring Distance</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Diagonals:</b> When measuring distance, the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2
        squares, the third counts as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can’t move diagonally past a corner (even by taking a 5-foot step). You can move diagonally past a creature,
        even an opponent.
      </p>

      <p>You can also move diagonally past other impassable obstacles, such as pits.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Closest Creature:</b> When it’s important to determine the closest square or creature to a location, if two
        squares or creatures are equally close, randomly determine which one counts as closest by rolling a die.
      </p>

      <h4>Moving through a Square</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Friend:</b> You can move through a square occupied by a friendly character, unless you are charging. When you
        move through a square occupied by a friendly character, that character doesn’t provide you with <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Opponent:</b> You can’t move through a square occupied by an opponent, unless the opponent is helpless. You
        can move through a square occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty. (Some creatures, particularly very
        large ones, may present an obstacle even when helpless. In such cases, each square you move through counts as 2
        squares.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ending Your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a>:</b> You can’t end your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> in the same square as another creature unless it is
        helpless.
      </p>

      <p><b><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">Overrun</a>:</b> During your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> you can attempt to move through a square occupied by an opponent.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Tumbling:</b> A trained character can attempt to <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-20">tumble</a> through a square occupied by an opponent (see the
        <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-20">Tumble</a> skill).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Very Small Creature:</b> A Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creature can move into or through an occupied square.
        The creature provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> when doing so.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Square Occupied by Creature Three Sizes Larger or Smaller:</b> Any creature can move through a square
        occupied by a creature three size categories larger than it is.
      </p>

      <p>A big creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories smaller than it is.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Designated Exceptions:</b> Some creatures break the above rules. A creature that completely fills the squares
        it occupies cannot be moved past, even with the <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-20">Tumble</a> skill or similar <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1">special abilities</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Terrain and Obstacles</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Difficult Terrain: </b>Difficult terrain hampers <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2
        squares of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>. (Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares.) You can’t <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> or
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> across difficult terrain.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain
        you occupy will allow.
      </p>

      <p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Obstacles:</b> Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>. If an obstacle hampers <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement </a> but
        doesn’t completely block it each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>.
        You must pay this cost to cross the barrier, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side.
        If you don’t have sufficient <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> to cross the barrier and move into the square on the other side, you can’t
        cross the barrier. Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, some obstacles block <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> entirely. A character can’t move through a blocking obstacle.
      </p>

      <p>Flying and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles</p>

      <p>
        <b>Squeezing:</b> In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn’t as wide as the space
        you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each
        move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space you
        take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares) squeezes into a space that’s one square wide, the
        creature’s miniature figure occupies two squares, centered on the line between the two squares. For a bigger
        creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.
      </p>

      <p>A creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it can’t end its <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> in an occupied square.</p>

      <p>
        To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space’s width, you must use the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-12">Escape Artist </a> skill. You
        can’t attack while using <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-12">Escape Artist</a> to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty to AC,
        and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.
      </p>

      <h4>Special <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a> Rules</h4>

      <p>These rules <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> special <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> situations.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Accidentally Ending <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a> in an Illegal Space:</b> Sometimes a character ends its <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement </a> while moving
        through a space where it’s not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position
        you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Double <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a> Cost:</b> When your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> is hampered in some way, your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> usually costs double. For
        example, each square of <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through
        such terrain counts as 3 squares (just as two diagonal moves normally do).
      </p>

      <p>
        If <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally).
        If <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This
        is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Minimum <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a>:</b> Despite penalties to <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1
        square) in any direction, even diagonally. (This rule doesn’t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to
        move when all <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> is prohibited.) Such <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> as normal (despite the
        distance covered, this move isn’t a 5-foot step).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-2"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-1-2">BIG AND LITTLE CREATURES IN COMBAT</a></h3>

      <p>Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures:</b> Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This
        means that more than one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space
        only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into a single square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine
        creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a
        natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to
        attack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack into your own square
        if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not
        threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>. They also
        can’t flank an enemy.
      </p>

      <p><b>Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures:</b> Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.</p>

      <p>
        Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they
        can reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent squares.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet)
        still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack
        of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a> of its reach
        before you can attack it. (This attack of opportunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Large or larger creatures using reach <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> can strike up to double their natural reach but can’t strike at
        their natural reach or less.

      <h3 id="section-2-2"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">COVER</a></h3>

      <p>
        To determine whether your target has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line
        from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of
        effect or provides <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover </a> (+4 to AC).
      </p>

      <p>
        When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> if any line from your square to the
        target’s square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that
        isn’t adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> from ranged attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Low Obstacles and <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">Cover</a>:</b> A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>,
        but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> if he’s closer to the
        obstacle than his target.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">Cover</a> and Attacks of Opportunity:</b> You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> relative to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">Cover</a> and Reflex Saves:</b> <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">Cover</a> grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or
        <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a> out from a point on the other side of the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> from you. Note that spread effects can extend around
        corners and thus negate this <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Cover and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> Checks:</b> You can use <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> to make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check. Without <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>, you usually need
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> (see below) to make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Soft Cover:</b> Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> against ranged attacks, giving you a
        +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> allow you to
        make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Big Creatures and <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">Cover</a>:</b> Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover </a> against
        melee attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it
        occupies to determine if an opponent has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack
        against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if it has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> against you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">Cover</a>:</b> If you don’t have line of effect to your target he is considered to have total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> from
        you. You can’t make an attack against a target that has total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Varying Degrees of Cover:</b> In some cases, <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In
        such situations the normal <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A
        creature with this improved <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save
        bonus applies. Furthermore, improved <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> provides a +10 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> checks.

      <p>
        To determine whether your target has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any
        line from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that provides
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>, the target has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> if his space is entirely
        within an effect that grants <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>. When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you
        use the rules for determining <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> from ranged attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, some magical effects provide <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> exists.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Concealment Miss Chance: </b><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">Concealment</a> gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the
        attacker missed because of the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>. If the attacker hits, the defender must make a miss chance
        percentile roll to avoid being struck. Multiple <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> do not stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Concealment and <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> Checks:</b> You can use <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> to make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check. Without <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>, you
        usually need <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> to make a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">Concealment</a>:</b> If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight he is considered to have
        total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> from you. You can’t attack an opponent that has total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>, though you can attack into
        a square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>, even if you know what
        square or squares the opponent occupies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Ignoring Concealment:</b> <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">Concealment</a> isn’t always effective. A shadowy area or <a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-2">darkness</a> doesn’t provide any
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a> against an opponent with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-8">darkvision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a>. Characters with <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-22">low-light vision</a><a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-35"></a> can see clearly for a greater
        distance with the same <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> source than other characters. Although <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-20">invisibility </a> provides total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>,
        sighted opponents may still make <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-17">Spot</a> checks to notice the location of an invisible character. An invisible
        character gains a +20 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> checks if moving, or a +40 bonus on <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-2">Hide</a> checks when not moving (even though
        opponents can’t see you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual clues).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Varying Degrees of <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">Concealment</a>:</b> Certain situations may provide more or less than typical <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>, and
        modify the miss chance accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-2-4"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-4">FLANKING</a></h3>

      <p>
        When making a melee attack, you get a +2 <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-4">flanking</a> bonus if your opponent is threatened by a character or
        creature friendly to you on the opponent’s opposite border or opposite corner.
      </p>

      <p>
        When in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line
        between the two friendly characters’ centers. If the line passes through opposite borders of the opponent’s
        space (including corners of those borders), then the opponent is flanked.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Exception: </i>If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-4">flanking</a> bonus if any square it occupies
        counts for <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-4">flanking</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-4">flanking</a> bonus.</p>

      <p>Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can’t flank an opponent.</p>

      <h3 id="section-2-5"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-5">HELPLESS DEFENDERS</a></h3>

      <p>A helpless opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or otherwise at your mercy.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Regular Attack:</b> A helpless character takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks, but no penalty to AC
        against ranged attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        A helpless defender can’t use any Dexterity bonus to AC. In fact, his Dexterity score is treated as if it were 0
        and his Dexterity modifier to AC as if it were –5 (and a <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-3">rogue</a> can sneak attack him).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Coup de Grace:</b> As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a
        helpless opponent. You can also use a bow or crossbow, provided you are adjacent to the target.
      </p>

      <p>
        You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, he must make a Fortitude
        save (DC 10 + <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt) or die. A <a href="character-classes-ii.html#section-3">rogue</a> also gets her extra sneak attack <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> against a helpless opponent
        when delivering a coup de grace.
      </p>

      <p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> from threatening opponents.</p>

      <p>
        You can’t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits. You can deliver a coup de
        grace against a creature with total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-3">concealment</a>, but doing this requires two consecutive <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-5">full-round actions</a> (one
        to “find” the creature once you’ve determined what square it’s in, and one to deliver the coup de grace).

      <p>
        In melee combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If
        you’re in position to make a melee attack on an opponent that is engaging a friend in melee combat, you can
        attempt to <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-4">aid</a> your friend as a standard action. You make an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> against AC 10. If you succeed, your
        friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that
        opponent’s next attack (your choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn.
        Multiple characters can <a href="spells-a-b.html#section-0-4">aid</a> the same friend, and similar bonuses stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also use this standard action to help a friend in other ways, such as when he is affected by a spell, or
        to assist another character’s skill check.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-2"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-2">BULL RUSH</a></h3>

      <p>
        You can make a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-2">bull rush</a> as a standard action (an attack) or as part of a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> (see <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">Charge</a>, below). When you
        make a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-2">bull rush</a>, you attempt to push an opponent straight back instead of damaging him. You can only <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-2">bull rush</a>
        an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Initiating a Bull Rush: </b>First, you move into the defender’s space. Doing this provokes an attack of
        opportunity from each opponent that threatens you, including the defender. (If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-45">Improved Bull Rush</a>
        feat, you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender.) Any attack of opportunity made by anyone
        other than the defender against you during a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-2">bull rush</a> has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting the defender
        instead, and any attack of opportunity by anyone other than you against the defender likewise has a 25% chance
        of accidentally targeting you. (When someone makes an attack of opportunity, make the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> and then roll
        to see whether the attack went astray.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, you and the defender make opposed Strength checks. You each add a +4 bonus for each size category you
        are larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for each size category you are smaller than Medium. You get a +2 bonus if
        you are charging. The defender gets a +4 bonus if he has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally
        stable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bull Rush Results:</b> If you beat the defender’s Strength check result, you push him back 5 feet. If you
        <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-54">wish</a> to move with the defender, you can push him back an additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which your check
        result is greater than the defender’s check result. You can’t, however, exceed your normal <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> limit. (<i>Note: </i>The defender provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> if he is moved. So do you, if you move with him. The two of you do
        not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> from each other, however.)
      </p>

      <p>
        If you fail to beat the defender’s Strength check result, you move 5 feet straight back to where you were before
        you moved into his space. If that space is occupied, you fall prone in that space.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-3"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">CHARGE</a></h3>

      <p>
        Charging is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to twice your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> and attack during the
        action. However, it carries tight restrictions on how you can move.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Movement During a Charge:</b> You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet (2
        squares) and may move up to double your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> directly toward the designated opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> (such as difficult terrain
        or obstacles). Here’s what it means to have a clear path. First, you must move to the closest space from which
        you can attack the opponent. (If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can’t <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>.) Second, if any
        line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>, slows <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>,
        or contains a creature (even an ally), you can’t <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>. (Helpless creatures don’t stop a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>If you don’t have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can’t <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a> that opponent.</p>

      <p>You can’t take a 5-foot step in the same round as a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>.</p>

      <p>
        If you are able to take only a standard action or a move action on your turn, you can still <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, but you are
        only allowed to move up to your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (instead of up to double your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>). You can’t use this option unless you
        are restricted to taking only a standard action or move action on your turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Attacking on a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">Charge</a>:</b> After moving, you may make a single melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the attack
        roll. and take a –2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn.

      <h3 id="section-3-4"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">DISARM</a></h3>

      <p>
        As a melee attack, you may attempt to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> your opponent. If you do so with a weapon, you <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-61">knock </a> the opponent’s
        weapon out of his hands and to the ground. If you attempt the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> while unarmed, you end up with the weapon
        in your hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re attempting to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> a melee weapon, follow the steps outlined here. If the item you are attempting to
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> isn’t a melee weapon the defender may still oppose you with an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>, but takes a penalty and can’t
        attempt to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> you in return if your attempt fails.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 1:</b> Attack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you are trying to
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a>. (If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-48">Improved Disarm</a> feat, you don’t incur an attack of opportunity for making a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a>
        attempt.) If the defender’s attack of opportunity deals any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, your <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> attempt fails.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 2:</b> Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. The
        wielder of a two-handed weapon on a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>
        weapon takes a –4 penalty. (An unarmed strike is considered a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> weapon, so you always take a penalty when
        trying to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> an opponent by using an unarmed strike.) If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger
        combatant gets a bonus on the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> of +4 per difference in size category. If the targeted item isn’t a
        melee weapon, the defender takes a –4 penalty on the roll.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step Three:</b> Consequences. If you beat the defender, the defender is <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a>ed. If you attempted the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a>
        action unarmed, you now have the weapon. If you were armed, the defender’s weapon is on the ground in the
        defender’s square.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you fail on the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> attempt, the defender may immediately react and attempt to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> you with the same
        sort of opposed melee <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>. His attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from you. If he fails
        his <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> attempt, you do not subsequently get a free <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> attempt against him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note: </i>A defender wearing spiked gauntlets can’t be disarmed. A defender using a weapon attached to a
        locked gauntlet gets a +10 bonus to resist being disarmed.
      </p>

      <p>Grabbing Items</p>

      <p>
        You can use a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> action to <a href="monster-feats.html#section-0-12">snatch</a> an item worn by the target. If you want to have the item in your hand, the
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> must be made as an unarmed attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the item is poorly secured or otherwise easy to <a href="monster-feats.html#section-0-12">snatch</a> or cut away the attacker gets a +4 bonus. Unlike on a
        normal <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> attempt, failing the attempt doesn’t allow the defender to attempt to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm </a> you. This otherwise
        functions identically to a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> attempt, as noted above.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can’t <a href="monster-feats.html#section-0-12">snatch</a> an item that is well secured unless you have pinned the wearer (see <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">Grapple</a>). Even then, the
        defender gains a +4 bonus on his roll to resist the attempt.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-5"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-5">FEINT</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-5">Feint</a>ing is a standard action. To <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-5">feint</a>, make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check opposed by a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> check by your target. The
        target may add his base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> to this <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> check. If your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-4">Bluff</a> check result exceeds your
        target’s <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-13">Sense Motive</a> check result, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use
        his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        When feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid you take a –4 penalty. Against a creature of animal Intelligence
        (1 or 2), you take a –8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.
      </p>

      <p>Feinting in combat does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Feinting as a Move Action:</b> With the <a href="feats.html#section-3-50">Improved Feint</a> feat, you can attempt a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-5">feint</a> as a move action instead
        of as a standard action.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-3-6"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">GRAPPLE</a></h3>

      <p><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">Grapple</a> Checks</p>

      <p>
        Repeatedly in a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>, you need to make opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> checks against an opponent. A <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple </a> check is like a
        melee <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>. Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> on a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check is: Base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> + Strength modifier + special size
        modifier
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special Size Modifier:</b> The special size modifier for a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check is as follows: Colossal +16,
        Gargantuan +12, Huge +8, Large +4, Medium +0, Small –4, Tiny –8, Diminutive –12, Fine –16. Use this number in
        place of the normal size modifier you use when making an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Starting a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">Grapple</a></p>

      <p>
        To start a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>, you need to grab and hold your target. Starting a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> requires a successful melee attack
        roll. If you get multiple attacks, you can attempt to start a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> multiple times (at successively lower base
        attack bonuses).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 1:</b> Attack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you are trying to
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>. If the attack of opportunity deals <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> attempt fails. (Certain monsters do not provoke
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> when they attempt to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>, nor do characters with the <a href="feats.html#section-3-51">Improved Grapple</a> feat.) If the
        attack of opportunity misses or fails to deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, proceed to Step 2.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 2:</b> Grab. You make a melee touch attack to grab the target. If you fail to hit the target, the
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple </a> attempt fails. If you succeed, proceed to Step 3.
      </p>

      <p><b>Step 3:</b> Hold. Make an opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check as a free action.</p>

      <p>
        If you succeed, you and your target are now grappling, and you deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the target as if with an unarmed
        strike.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you lose, you fail to start the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>. You automatically lose an attempt to hold if the target is two or
        more size categories larger than you are.
      </p>

      <p>
        In case of a tie, the combatant with the higher <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check modifier wins. If this is a tie, roll again to
        break the tie.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 4:</b> Maintain <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">Grapple</a>. To maintain the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> for later rounds, you must move into the target’s
        space. (This <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> is free and doesn’t count as part of your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> in the round.)
      </p>

      <p>Moving, as normal, provokes <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> from threatening opponents, but not from your target.</p>

      <p>
        If you can’t move into your target’s space, you can’t maintain the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> and must immediately let go of the
        target. To <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> again, you must begin at Step 1.
      </p>

      <p>Grappling Consequences</p>

      <p>While you’re grappling, your ability to attack others and defend yourself is limited.</p>

      <p><b>No Threatened Squares:</b> You don’t threaten any squares while grappling.</p>

      <p>
        <b>No Dexterity Bonus:</b> You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if you have one) against opponents you aren’t
        grappling. (You can still use it against opponents you are grappling.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>No <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">Movement</a>:</b> You can’t move normally while grappling. You may, however, make an opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check
        (see below) to move while grappling.
      </p>

      <p>If You’re Grappling</p>

      <p>
        When you are grappling (regardless of who started the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>), you can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> any of the following actions.
        Some of these actions take the place of an attack (rather than being a standard action or a move action). If
        your base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> allows you multiple attacks, you can attempt one of these actions in place of each of
        your attacks, but at successively lower base attack bonuses.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Activate a Magic Item:</b> You can activate a magic item, as long as the item doesn’t require a spell
        completion trigger. You don’t need to make a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check to activate the item.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Attack Your Opponent:</b> You can make an attack with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light </a> weapon
        against another character you are grappling. You take a –4 penalty on such attacks.
      </p>

      <p>You can’t attack with two <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> while grappling, even if both are <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Cast a Spell:</b> You can attempt to cast a spell while grappling or even while pinned (see below), provided
        its <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-6">casting time</a> is no more than 1 standard action, it has no somatic component, and you have in hand any
        material <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a> or focuses you might need. Any spell that requires precise and careful action<i> </i>is
        impossible to cast while grappling or being pinned. If the spell is one that you can cast while grappling, you
        must make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check (DC 20 + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) or lose the spell. You don’t have to make a successful
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check to cast the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Damage Your Opponent:</b> While grappling, you can deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to your opponent equivalent to an unarmed
        strike. Make an opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check in place of an attack. If you win, you deal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> as normal for
        your unarmed strike (1d3 points for Medium attackers or 1d2 points for Small attackers, plus Strength
        modifiers). If you want to deal lethal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, you take a –4 penalty on your <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Exception: </i>Monks deal more <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> on an unarmed strike than other characters, and the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is lethal.
        However, they can choose to deal their <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a> when grappling without taking the usual –4
        penalty for changing lethal <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-6-8">nonlethal damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Draw a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">Light</a> Weapon:</b> You can draw a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> weapon as a move action with a successful <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple </a> check.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Escape from <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">Grapple</a>:</b> You can escape a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> by winning an opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check in place of making an
        attack. You can make an <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-12">Escape Artist</a> check in place of your <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check if you so desire, but this requires a
        standard action. If more than one opponent is grappling you, your <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple </a> check result has to beat all their
        individual check results to escape. (Opponents don’t have to try to hold you if they don’t want to.) If you
        escape, you finish the action by moving into any space adjacent to your opponent(s).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Move:</b> You can move half your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a> (bringing all others engaged in the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> with you) by winning an
        opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check. This requires a standard action, and you must beat all the other individual check results
        to move the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note: </i>You get a +4 bonus on your <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check to move a pinned opponent, but only if no one else is
        involved in the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-11">Retrieve</a> a Spell Component: </b>You can produce a spell component from your pouch while grappling by using a
        full-round action. Doing so does not require a successful <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Pin Your Opponent:</b> You can hold your opponent immobile for 1 round by winning an opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check
        (made in place of an attack). Once you have an opponent pinned, you have a few options available to you (see
        below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Break Another’s Pin: </b>If you are grappling an opponent who has another character pinned, you can make an
        opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check in place of an attack. If you win, you break the hold that the opponent has over the other
        character. The character is still grappling, but is no longer pinned.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Use Opponent’s Weapon: </b>If your opponent is holding a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a> weapon, you can use it to attack him. Make an
        opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check (in place of an attack). If you win, make an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> with the weapon with a –4 penalty
        (doing this doesn’t require another action).
      </p>

      <p>You don’t gain possession of the weapon by performing this action.</p>

      <p>If You’re Pinning an Opponent</p>

      <p>
        You can attempt to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> your opponent with an opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check, you can attempt to use your opponent’s
        weapon against him, or you can attempt to move the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> (all described above). At your option, you can
        prevent a pinned opponent from speaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can use a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">disarm</a> action to remove or grab away a well secured object worn by a pinned opponent, but he gets
        a +4 bonus on his roll to resist your attempt (see <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">Disarm</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        You may voluntarily release a pinned character as a free action; if you do so, you are no longer considered to
        be grappling that character (and vice versa).
      </p>

      <p>
        You can’t draw or use a weapon (against the pinned character or any other character), escape another’s <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>,
        <a href="psionic-powers-q-w.html#section-0-11">retrieve</a> a spell component, pin another character, or break another’s pin while you are pinning an opponent.
      </p>

      <p>If You’re Pinned by an Opponent</p>

      <p>
        When an opponent has pinned you, you are held immobile (but not helpless) for 1 round. While you’re pinned, you
        take a –4 penalty to your AC against opponents other than the one pinning you. At your opponent’s option, you
        may also be unable to speak. On your turn, you can try to escape the pin by making an opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check in
        place of an attack. You can make an <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-12">Escape Artist</a> check in place of your <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check if you want, but this
        requires a standard action. If you win, you escape the pin, but you’re still grappling.
      </p>

      <p>Joining a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">Grapple</a></p>

      <p>
        If your target is already grappling someone else, you can use an attack to start a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>, as above, except
        that the target doesn’t get an attack of opportunity against you, and your grab automatically succeeds. You
        still have to make a successful opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> check to become part of the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If there are multiple opponents involved in the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>, you pick one to make the opposed <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple </a> check against.
      </p>

      <p>Multiple Grapplers</p>

      <p>
        Several combatants can be in a single <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>. Up to four combatants can <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a> a single opponent in a given
        round. Creatures that are one or more size categories smaller than you count for half, creatures that are one
        size category larger than you count double, and creatures two or more size categories larger count quadruple.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you are grappling with multiple opponents, you choose one opponent to make an opposed check against. The
        exception is an attempt to escape from the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple</a>; to successfully escape, your <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-6">grapple </a> check must beat the
        check results of each opponent.

      <p>
        <b>Horses in Combat: </b>Warhorses and warponies can serve readily as combat steeds. <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">Light</a> horses, ponies, and
        heavy horses, however, are frightened by combat. If you don’t dismount, you must make a DC 20 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> check each
        round as a move action to control such a <a href="monsters-animals.html#section-21">horse</a>. If you succeed, you can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> a standard action after the move
        action. If you fail, the move action becomes a full round action and you can’t do anything else until your next
        turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> acts on your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> count as you direct it. You move at its <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, but the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> uses its action
        to move.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="monsters-animals.html#section-21">horse</a> (not a <a href="monsters-animals.html#section-33">pony</a>) is a Large creature and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity,
        assume that you share your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>’s space during combat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Combat while Mounted:</b> With a DC 5 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> check, you can guide your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> with your knees so as to use both
        hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you attack a creature smaller than your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> that is on foot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for
        being on higher ground. If your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee attack.
        Essentially, you have to wait until the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> gets to your enemy before attacking, so you can’t make a full
        attack. Even at your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>’s full <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, you don’t take any penalty on melee attacks while mounted.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>s, you also take the AC penalty associated with a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>. If you make an attack at the end
        of the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>, you receive the bonus gained from the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">charge</a>. When charging on horseback, you deal double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>
        with a lance (see <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-3">Charge</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        You can use ranged <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> while your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> is taking a double move, but at a –4 penalty on the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a>. You
        can use ranged <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> while your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> is running (quadruple <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>), at a –8 penalty. In either case, you make
        the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> when your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> has completed half its <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>. You can make a full attack with a ranged weapon
        while your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> is moving. Likewise, you can take <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a> normally
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Casting <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">Spells</a> while Mounted:</b> You can cast a spell normally if your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> moves up to a normal move (its
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>) either before or after you cast. If you have your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> move both before and after you cast a spell, then
        you’re casting the spell while the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> is moving, and you have to make a <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check due to the
        vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>) or lose the spell. If the <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> is running (quadruple <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>), you can cast
        a spell when your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> has moved up to twice its <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-6">speed</a>, but your <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check is more difficult due to
        the violent motion (DC 15 + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>If Your Mount Falls in Battle:</b> If your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> check to make a
        soft fall and take no <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. If the check fails, you take 1d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.

        <b>If You Are Dropped:</b> If you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (or 75%

      </p>

      <p>Without you to guide it, your <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a> avoids combat.</p>

      <h3 id="section-3-8"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">OVERRUN</a></h3>

      <p>
        You can attempt an <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun</a> as a standard action taken during your move. (In general, you cannot take a standard
        action during a move; this is an exception.) With an <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun</a>, you attempt to plow past or over your opponent
        (and move through his square) as you move. You can only <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun</a> an opponent who is one size category larger than
        you, the same size, or smaller. You can make only one <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun </a> attempt per round.
      </p>

      <p>If you’re attempting to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun</a> an opponent, follow these steps.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 1:</b> Attack of Opportunity. Since you begin the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun</a> by moving into the defender’s space, you
        provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 2: </b>Opponent Avoids? The defender has the option to simply avoid you. If he avoids you, he doesn’t
        suffer any ill effect and you may keep moving (You can always move through a square occupied by someone who lets
        you by.) The <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun</a> attempt doesn’t count against your actions this round (except for any <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> required to
        enter the opponent’s square). If your opponent doesn’t avoid you, move to Step 3.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 3:</b> Opponent Blocks? If your opponent blocks you, make a Strength check opposed by the defender’s
        Dexterity or Strength check (whichever ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus on
        the check for every size category he is larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for every size category he is smaller
        than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable
        than a normal humanoid. If you win, you <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-61">knock</a> the defender prone. If you lose, the defender may immediately
        react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check (including the size modifiers noted
        above, but no other modifiers) to try to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-61">knock</a> you prone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 4: </b>Consequences. If you succeed in knocking your opponent prone, you can continue your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> as
        normal. If you fail and are knocked prone in turn, you have to move 5 feet back the way you came and fall prone,
        ending your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> there. If you fail but are not knocked prone, you have to move 5 feet back the way you
        came, ending your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> there. If that square is occupied, you fall prone in that square.
      </p>

      <p><b>Improved <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">Overrun</a>:</b> If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-53">Improved Overrun</a><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8"></a> feat, your target may not choose to avoid you.</p>

        to determine the success or failure of the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun</a> attack (and applies its size modifier, rather than yours). If
        you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-104">Trample</a> feat and attempt an <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-8">overrun</a> while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you, and if

        <b>Step 1:</b> Attack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target whose weapon or
        <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a> you are trying to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-9">sunder</a>. (If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-56">Improved Sunder</a><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-9"></a> feat, you don’t incur an attack of opportunity
        for making the attempt.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 2: </b>Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>. The
        wielder of a two-handed weapon on a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-9">sunder</a> attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>
        weapon takes a –4 penalty. If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> of +4 per difference in size category.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Step 3:</b> Consequences. If you beat the defender, roll <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> and deal it to the weapon or <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a>. See
        Table: Common <a href="equipment.html#section-3">Armor</a>, Weapon, and <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">Shield</a> Hardness and <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">Hit Points</a> to determine how much <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage </a> you must deal to
        destroy the weapon or <a href="spells-s.html#section-0-27">shield</a>.
      </p>

      <p>If you fail the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-9">sunder</a> attempt, you don’t deal any <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Sundering a Carried or Worn Object: </i>You don’t use an opposed <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> to <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> a carried or worn
        object. Instead, just make an <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-1">attack roll</a> against the object’s AC. A carried or worn object’s AC is equal to 10
        + its size modifier + the Dexterity modifier of the carrying or wearing character. Attacking a carried or worn
        object provokes an attack of opportunity just as attacking a held object does. To attempt to <a href="monster-feats.html#section-0-12">snatch</a> away an item
        worn by a defender rather than <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> it, see <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-4">Disarm</a>.

      <h3 id="section-3-10"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-10">THROW SPLASH WEAPON</a></h3>

      <p>
        A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target
        and nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target.
        Thrown <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> require no weapon proficiency, so you don’t take the –4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals
        direct hit <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to the target, and splash <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you
        target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, and the direct hit
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> is not dealt to any creature. (You can’t target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a
        Large or larger creature; in this case, you’re aiming at the creature.)
      </p>

      <p>
        If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the
        <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-40">misdirection</a> of the throw, with 1 being straight back at you and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the grid
        intersection or target creature. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>
        increment of the throw.
      </p>

      <p>After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to all creatures in adjacent squares.</p>

      <h3 id="section-3-11"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">TRIP</a></h3>

      <p>
        You can try to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> an opponent as an unarmed melee attack. You can only <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> an opponent who is one size
        category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Making a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">Trip</a> Attack:</b> Make an unarmed melee touch attack against your target. This provokes an attack of
        opportunity from your target as normal for unarmed attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your attack succeeds, make a Strength check opposed by the defender’s Dexterity or Strength check (whichever
        ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus for every size category he is larger than
        Medium or a –4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his
        check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> the
        defender. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or
        Strength check to try to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Avoiding Attacks of Opportunity: </i>If you have the <a href="feats.html#section-3-57">Improved Trip</a><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11"></a> feat, or if you are <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a>ping with a weapon
        (see below), you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity for making a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> attack.
      </p>

      <p><b>Being Tripped (Prone):</b> A tripped character is prone. Standing up is a move action.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Tripping a Mounted Opponent:</b> You may make a <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> attack against a mounted opponent. The defender may make
        a <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-11">Ride</a> check in place of his Dexterity or Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the rider from his <a href="spells-m-o.html#section-0-45">mount</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Tripping with a Weapon:</b> Some <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a> can be used to make <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> attacks. In this case, you make a melee
        touch attack with the weapon instead of an unarmed melee touch attack, and you don’t provoke an attack of
        opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>If you are <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a>ped during your own <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-11">trip</a> attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.</p>

      <p>
        Good clerics and paladins and some neutral clerics can channel positive <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>, which can halt, drive off
        (rout), or destroy undead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Evil clerics and some neutral clerics can channel negative <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a>, which can halt, awe (rebuke), control
        (<a href="spells-c.html#section-0-24">command</a>), or bolster undead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of the effect, the general term for the activity is “turning.” When attempting to exercise their
        divine control over these creatures, characters make turning checks.
      </p>

      <p>Turning Checks</p>

      <p>
        Turning undead is a supernatural ability that a character can <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-9">perform</a> as a standard action. It does not provoke
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <p>You must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Times per Day: </b>You may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma
        modifier. You can increase this number by taking the <a href="feats.html#section-3-34">Extra Turning</a> feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">Range</a>:</b> You turn the closest turnable undead first, and you can’t turn undead that are more than 60 feet
        away or that have total <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-2-2">cover</a> relative to you. You don’t need line of sight to a target, but you do need line of
        effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Turning Check:</b> The first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead creature you
        can turn. This is a Charisma check (1d20 + your Charisma modifier). Table: Turning Undead gives you the Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>
        of the most powerful undead you can affect, relative to your <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. On a given turning attempt, you can turn no
        undead creature whose Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> exceed the result on this table.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Turning Damage:</b> If your roll on Table: Turning Undead is high enough to let you turn at least some of the
        undead within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + your <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + your Charisma modifier for turning <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. That’s how many
        total Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> of undead you can turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your Charisma score is average or low, it’s possible to roll fewer Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> of undead turned than indicated
        on Table: Turning Undead.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may skip over already turned undead that are still within <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-7">range</a>, so that you do not waste your turning
        capacity on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Effect and <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">Duration</a> of Turning:</b> Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to
        them. They flee for 10 rounds (1 minute). If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack rolls against them
        a +2 bonus). If you approach within 10 feet of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally. (You
        can stand within 10 feet without breaking the turning effect—you just can’t approach them.) You can attack them
        with ranged attacks (from at least 10 feet away), and others can attack them in any fashion, without breaking
        the turning effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Destroying Undead:</b> If you have twice as many levels (or more) as the undead have Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>, you destroy
        any that you would normally turn.

        <b>Dispelling Turning:</b> An evil <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> may channel negative <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> to dispel a good <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a>’s turning effect.
        The evil <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> makes a turning check as if attempting to rebuke the undead. If the turning check result is
        equal to or greater than the turning check result that the good <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> scored when turning the undead, then the
        undead are no longer turned. The evil <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> rolls turning <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> of 2d6 + <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> + Charisma modifier to
        see how many Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> worth of undead he can affect in this way (as if he were rebuking them).

        <b>Bolstering Undead:</b> An evil <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> may also bolster undead creatures against turning in advance. He makes
        a turning check as if attempting to rebuke the undead, but the Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> result on Table: Turning Undead becomes
        the undead creatures’ effective Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a> as far as turning is concerned (provided the result is higher than the
        creatures’ actual Hit <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-0-1">Dice</a>). The bolstering lasts 10 rounds. An evil undead <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> can bolster himself in this
        manner.

      <p>Neutral Clerics and Undead</p>

      <p>
        A <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> of neutral <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> can either turn undead but not rebuke them, or rebuke undead but not turn them.
        See <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-3-12">Turn or Rebuke Undead</a> for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if a <a href="character-classes-i.html#section-3">cleric</a> is neutral, channeling positive <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> is a good act and channeling negative <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> is evil.

      <p>Paladins and Undead</p>

      <p>
        Beginning at 4th <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, paladins can turn undead as if they were clerics of three levels lower than they
        actually are.

      <p>Turning Other Creatures</p>

      <p>Some clerics have the ability to turn creatures other than undead.</p>

      <p>The turning check result is determined as normal.</p>

      <h3 id="section-3-13"><a href="feats.html#section-3-106">TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</a></h3>

      <p>
        If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. You
        suffer a –6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to the attack
        with your off hand when you fight this way. You can reduce these penalties in two ways:
      </p>

      <p>
        •If your off-hand weapon is <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed strike is always considered
        <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-66">light</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>•The <a href="feats.html#section-3-106">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6.</p>

      <p>Table: <a href="feats.html#section-3-106">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> Penalties summarizes the interaction of all these factors.</p>

      <h2 id="section-4"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4">SPECIAL INITIATIVE ACTIONS</a></h2>

      <p>Here are ways to change when you act during combat by altering your place in the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> order.</p>

      <h3 id="section-4-1"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">DELAY</a></h3>

      <p>
        By choosing to <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a>, you take no action and then act normally on whatever <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> count you decide to act.
        When you <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a>, you voluntarily reduce your own <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> result for the rest of the combat. When your new,
        lower <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally. You can specify this new
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> result or just wait until some time later in the round and act then, thus fixing your new <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a>
        count at that point.
      </p>

      <p>
        You never get back the time you spend waiting to see what’s going to happen. You can’t, however, interrupt
        anyone else’s action (as you can with a readied action).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">Initiative</a> Consequences of Delaying: </b>Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> result becomes the count on which you took the
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a>ed action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed an action, you don’t get to take a
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a>ed action (though you can <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a> again).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> count rises
        to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-4-2"><a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">READY</a></h3>

      <p>
        The <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your turn is over but before your next one has
        begun. <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">Ready</a>ing is a standard action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though the action that you
        <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> might do so).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Readying an Action:</b> You can <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> a standard action, a move action, or a free action. To do so, specify
        the action you will take and the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> under which you will take it. Then, any time before your next
        action, you may take the readied action in response to that condition. The action occurs just before the action
        that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of another character’s activities, you interrupt the other
        character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he continues his actions once you complete your readied
        action. Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> result changes. For the rest of the encounter, your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> result is the count on
        which you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead of the character whose action triggered your
        readied action.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can take a 5-foot step as part of your readied action, but only if you don’t otherwise move any distance
        during the round.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Initiative Consequences of Readying:</b> Your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> result becomes the count on which you took the
        readied action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your readied action, you don’t get to
        take the readied action (though you can <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> the same action again). If you take your readied action in the
        next round, before your regular turn comes up, your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-3">initiative</a> count rises to that new point in the order of
        battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Distracting Spellcasters:</b> You can <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> an attack against a spellcaster with the trigger “if she starts
        casting a spell.” If you <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> the spellcaster, she may lose the spell she was trying to cast (as determined by
        her <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> check result).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Readying to Counterspell:</b> You may <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> a counterspell against a spellcaster (often with the trigger “if
        she starts casting a spell”). In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a chance to <a href="spells-h-l.html#section-0-31">identify</a> it
        with a <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> check (DC 15 + spell <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (are able to cast
        it and have it prepared, if you prepare <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a>), you can cast the spell as a counterspell and automatically <a href="epic-spells.html#section-7-36">ruin</a>
        the other spellcaster’s spell. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.
      </p>

      <p>A spellcaster can use <i><a href="spells-d-e.html#section-0-43">dispel magic</a> </i>to counterspell another spellcaster, but it doesn’t always work.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Readying a Weapon against a Charge:</b> You can <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-2">ready</a> certain piercing <a href="equipment.html#section-2">weapons</a>, setting them to receive
        charges. A readied weapon of this type deals double <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> if you score a hit with it against a charging
        character.
