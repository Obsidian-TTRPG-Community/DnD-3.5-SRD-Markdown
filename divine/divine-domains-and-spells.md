## New Spells

## Armor of Darkness

-   Abjuration \[Darkness\]
-   **Level:** Darkness 4
-   **Components:** V, S , D F
-   **Casting Time:** 1 action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** 10 minutes/level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The spell envelops the warded creature in a shroud of shadows. The
shroud can, if the caster desires, conceal the wearer's features. In any
case, it grants the recipient a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class plus
an additional +1 for every four caster levels (maximum bonus +8). The
subject can see through the armor as if it did not exist and is also
afforded darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Finally, the subject gains
a +2 bonus on saving throws against any holy, good, or light spells or
effects.Undead creatures that are subjects of *armor of darkness* also
gain +4 turn resistance.

## Blacklight

-   Evocation \[Darkness\]
-   **Level:** Darkness 3, Sor/Wiz 3
-   **Components:** V, S , M
-   **Casting Time:** 1 action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
-   **Area:** A 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object,
    or point in space
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates or none (object)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes or no (object)

The caster creates an area of total darkness. The darkness is
impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, but the caster can see
normally within the blacklit area. Creatures outside the spell's area,
even the caster, cannot see through it.

The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary
cast on a mobile object. A character can cast the spell on a creature,
and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves.
Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or
benefit from spell resistance.

*Blacklight* counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower
level. The 3rd-level cleric spell *daylight* counters or dispels
*blacklight.*

## Bolt of Glory

-   Evocation \[Good\]
-   **Level:** Glory 6
-   **Components:** V, S , D F
-   **Casting Time:** 1 action
-   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)
-   **Effect:** Ray
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell projects a bolt of energy from the Positive Energy Plane
against one creature. The caster must succeed at a ranged touch attack
to strike the target. A creature struck suffers varying damage,
depending on its nature and home plane of existence:

  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ---------------
  Creature's Origin/Nature                                Damage         Maximum Value
  Material Plane, Elemental Plane, neutral outsider       1d6/2 levels   7d6
  Negative Energy Plane, evil outsider, undead creature   1d6/level      15d6
  Positive Energy Plane, good outsider                    ---            ---
  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ---------------

## Bolts of Bedevilment

-   Enchantment \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Madness 5
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** One action
-   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
-   **Effect:** Ray
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell grants the caster the ability to make one ray attack per
round. The ray dazes one living creature, clouding its mind so that it
takes no action for 1d3 rounds. The creature is not stunned (so
attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast
spells, use mental abilities, and so on.

## Crown of Glory

-   Evocation
-   **Level:** Glory 8
-   **Components:** V, S , M, D F
-   **Casting Time:** 1 full round
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Area:** 120-ft.-radius emanation centered on you
-   **Duration:** 1 minute/level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The caster is imbued with an aura of celestial authority, inspiring awe
in all lesser creatures.

The caster gains a +4 enhancement bonus to his or her Charisma score for
the duration of the spell. All creatures with fewer than 8 HD or levels
cease whatever they are doing and are compelled to pay attention to the
caster. Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against the
caster must make a successful Will save to do so. Any creature that does
not make this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action
is *enthralled* for the duration of the spell (as the *enthrall* spell),
as long as it is in the spell's area, nor will it try to leave the area
on its own. Creatures with 8 HD or more may pay attention to the caster,
but are not affected by this spell.

When the caster speaks, all listeners telepathically understand him or
her, even if they do not understand the language. While the spell lasts,
the caster can make up to three suggestions to creatures of fewer than 8
HD in range, as if using the *mass suggestion* spell (Will save
negates); creatures with 8 HD or more aren't affected by this power.
Only creatures within range at the time a *suggestion* is given are
subject to it.

*Material Component:* worth at least 200 gp.

## Genesis

-   Conjuration (Creation)
-   **Level:** Creation 9
-   **Components:** V, S , M, X P
-   **Casting Time:** 1 week (8 hours/day)
-   **Range:** 180 ft.
-   **Effect:** A demiplane on the Ethereal Plane centered on your
    location
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell creates an immobile, finite plane with limited access---a
demi-plane.

Demiplanes created by this power are very small, minor planes. A
character can cast this spell only on the Ethereal Plane. When he or she
casts it, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a
demiplane. At first, the demiplane grows at a rate of a 1-foot-radius
per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as the fledgling plane
draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter or
astral ectoplasm.

The character determines the environment in the demiplane when he or she
first casts *genesis,*reflecting most any desire he or she can
visualize. The caster determines factors such as atmosphere, water,
temperature, and the shape of the general terrain. However, the spell
cannot create life, nor can it create construction. If desired, these
must be brought in by some other fashion.

Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the character can
continue to cast this spell to enlarge the demiplane if he or she is
inside the boundaries of the demiplane. In such a case, the radiusof the
demiplane increases by 60 feet for each subsequent casting.

If the spell is cast again while outside an existing demi-plane, the
casting creates a separate bubble that does not touch or overlap any
previously created demiplane.

*XP Cost:* 5,000 XP.

## Hardening

-   Transmutation
-   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6, Artifice 7
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** 1 action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** One item of a volume no greater than 10 cu. ft./level

(see text)

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

This spell increases the hardness of materials. For every two caster
levels, increase by 1 the hardness of the material targeted by the
spell. This hardness increase improves only the material's resistance to
damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement.

The *hardening* spell does not in any way affect resistance to other
forms of transformation.

This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet per level of the spellcaster.

If cast upon a metal or mineral, the volume is reduced to 1 cubic foot
per level.

## Maddening Scream

-   Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 8, Madness 8
-   **Components:** V
-   **Casting Time:** One action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Living creature touched
-   **Duration:** 1d4+1 rounds
-   **Saving Throw:** None
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The subject cannot keep him or herself from behaving as though
completely mad. This spell makes it impossible for the victim to do
anything other than race about caterwauling.

The effect worsens the Armor Class of the creature by 4, makes Reflex
saving throws impossible except on a roll of 20, and makes it impossible
to use a shield.

## Rage

-   Enchantment
-   **Level:** Madness 3
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** One action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The caster can put a creature into a blood frenzy. In this rage, the
creature gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus
on Will saves. (Unlike a barbarian rage, no penalty to AC is suffered,
and no fatigue period occurs after the rage is over.)

## Surelife

-   Abjuration
-   **Level:** Repose 8
-   **Components:** V, S, M
-   **Casting Time:** 1 round
-   **Range:** Personal
-   **Target:** You
-   **Duration:** 1 minute/2 levels

This spell allows the caster to protect him or herself against some
condition that would ordinarily cause certain death. The character can
only protect him or herself against a natural occurrence or condition,
not against a spell or the action of a creature. The character must
specify the condition against which he or she wishes to protect him or
herself, and the spell is effective only against that condition. Should
the character be subjected to that condition during the duration of the
spell, he or she feels no discomfort and takes no damage from the
condition. However, the spell does not protect any items carried on the
caster's person. At the end of the spell's duration, the condition has
full normal effects if the character is still subjected to it.

## Touch of Madness

-   Enchantment \[Mind-Affecting\]
-   **Level:** Madness 2
-   **Components:** V, S
-   **Casting Time:** One action
-   **Range:** Touch
-   **Target:** Creature touched
-   **Duration:** 1 round/level
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The caster may daze one living creature by making a successful touch
attack. If the target creature does not make a successful Will save, its
mind is clouded and it takes no action for 1 round per caster level. The
dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage
against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and
so on.

## True Creation

-   Conjuration (Creation)
-   **Level:** Creation 8
-   **Components:** V, S , M, X P
-   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
-   **Range:** 0 ft.
-   **Effect:** Unattended, nonmagical object of nonliving matter, up to

1 cu. ft./level

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

The caster creates a nonmagical, unattended object of any sort of
matter. Items created are permanent and cannot be negated by dispelling
magics or negating powers. For all intents and purposes, these items are
completely real. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic
foot per caster level. The caster must succeed at an appropriate skill
check to make a complex item.

Unlike the items brought into being by the lower-level spells *minor
creation* and *major creation,*objects created by the casting of *true
creation* can be used as material components.

*XP Cost:* The item's gold piece value in XP, or a minimum of 1 XP,
whichever is more.

## Undeath to Death

-   Necromancy
-   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6, Clr 6, Repose 6
-   **Components:** V, S , M, D F
-   **Casting Time:** 1 action
-   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
-   **Area:** Several undead creatures within a 50-ft.-radius burst
-   **Duration:** Instantaneous
-   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
-   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

*Undeath to death* snuffs out the animating forces of undead creatures,
killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of undead creatures
per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD are
affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those closest to the
point of origin of the burst are affected first.

*Material Component:* worth at least 500 gp.
