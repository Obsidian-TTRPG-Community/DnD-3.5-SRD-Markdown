## Potions and Oils

A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when imbibed. Magic
oils are similar to potions, except that oils are applied externally
rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used only once. It can
duplicate the effect of a spell of up to 3rd level that has a casting
time of less than 1 minute.

Potions are like spells cast upon the imbiber. The character taking the
potion doesn't get to make any decisions about the effect ---the caster
who brewed the potion has already done so. The drinker of a potion is
both the effective target and the caster of the effect (though the
potion indicates the caster level, the drinker still controls the
effect).

The person applying an oil is the effective caster, but the object is
the target.

### Physical Description
A typical potion or oil consists of 1 ounce of
liquid held in a ceramic or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper. The
stoppered container is usually no more than 1 inch wide and 2 inches
high. The vial has AC 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12.
Vials hold 1 ounce of liquid.

### Identifying Potions
In addition to the standard methods of
identification, PCs can sample from each container they find to attempt
to determine the nature of the liquid inside. An experienced character
learns to identify potions by memory

---for example, the last time she tasted a liquid that reminded her of
almonds, it turned out to be a *potion of cure moderate wounds*.

### Activation
Drinking a potion or applying an oil requires no special
skill. The user merely removes the stopper and swallows the potion or
smears on the oil. The following rules govern potion and oil use.

Drinking a potion or using an oil on an item of gear is a standard
action. The potion or oil takes effect immediately. Using a potion or
oil provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful attack (including
grappling attacks) against the character forces a Concentration check
(as for casting a spell). If the character fails this check, she cannot
drink the potion. An enemy may direct an attack of opportunity against
the potion or oil container rather than against the character. A
successful attack of this sort can destroy the container.

A creature must be able to swallow a potion or smear on an oil. Because
of this, incorporeal creatures cannot use potions or oils.

Any corporeal creature can imbibe a potion. The potion must be
swallowed. Any corporeal creature can use an oil.

A character can carefully administer a potion to an unconscious creature
as a full-round action, trickling the liquid down the creature's throat.
Likewise, it takes a full-round action to apply an oil to an unconscious
creature.

## Potion Descriptions

The caster level for a standard potion is the minimum caster level
needed to cast the spell (unless otherwise specified).

## Rings

Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have
charges. Anyone can use a ring.

A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic
ring doesn't work if the wearer is already wearing two magic rings.

### Physical Description
Rings have no appreciable weight. Although
exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority
of rings are forged from metal---usually precious metals such as gold,
silver, and platinum. A ring has AC 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a
break DC of 25.

### Activation
Usually, a ring's ability is activated by a command word
(a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) or it
works continually. Some rings have exceptional activation methods,
according to their descriptions.

### Special Qualities
Roll d%. A result of 01 indicates the ring is
intelligent, 02--31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or
the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32--100 indicates no
special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes
extraordinary powers and special purposes. Rings with charges can never
be intelligent.

## Ring Descriptions

Standard rings are described below.

### Animal Friendship
On command, this ring affects an animal as if the
wearer had cast *charm animal*.

Faint enchantment; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, *charm animal;* Price 10,800 gp.

### Blinking
On command, this ring makes the wearer blink, as with the
*blink* spell.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, *blink;* Price 27,000 gp.

### Chameleon Power
As a free action, the wearer of this ring can gain
the ability to magically blend in with the surroundings. This provides a
+10 competence bonus on her Hide checks. As a standard action, she can
also command the ring to utilize the spell *disguise self* as often as
she wants.

Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, *disguise self, invisibility;* Price
12,700 gp.

### Climbing
This ring is actually a magic leather cord that ties
around a finger. It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus
on Climb checks.

Faint transmutatation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in
the Climb skill; Price 2,500 gp.

### Climbing, Improved
As climbing, except it grants a +10 competence
bonus on its wearer's Climb checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in
the Climb skill; Price 10,000 gp.

### Counterspells
This ring might seem to be a *ring of spell storing*
upon first examination. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st
through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of
the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer,
the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring
no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the
spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as
before) may be placed in it again.

Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Forge Ring, *imbue with spell ability;*
Price 4,000 gp.

### Djinni Calling
One of the many rings of fable, this "genie" ring is
most useful indeed. It serves as a special *gate* by means of which a
specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the
ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni
appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the
wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the
djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and
worthless.

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Forge Ring, *gate;* Price 125,000 gp.

### Elemental Command
All four kinds of *elemental command* rings are
very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring
until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as
single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure
to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain
other powers as well as the following common properties.

Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the
wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he
may forego this protection and instead attempt to *charm* the elemental
(as *charm monster,* Will DC 17 negates). If the *charm* attempt fails,
however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at
*charming* can be made.

Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the
wearer take a --1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes
applicable saving throws from the extraplanar creature's attacks with a
+2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls
against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the damage reduction
of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not
have.

The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane
to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears
the ring. They show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are
similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is
strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him.

The possessor of a *ring of elemental command* takes a saving throw
penalty as follows:

  --------- -----------------------------------------------
  Element   Saving Throw Penalty
  Air       --2 against earth-based effects
  Earth     --2 against air- or electricity-based effects
  Fire      --2 against water- or cold-based effects
  Water     --2 against fire-based effects
  --------- -----------------------------------------------

In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its
wearer the following abilities according to its kind.

Ring of Elemental Command (Air)

-   *Feather fall* (unlimited use, wearer only)
-   *Resist energy (electricity)* (unlimited use, wearer only)
-   *Gust of wind* (twice per day)
-   *Wind wall* (unlimited use)
-   *Air walk* (once per day, wearer only)
-   *Chain lightning* (once per week)

The ring appears to be a *ring of feather falling* until a certain
condition is met to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated
each time a new wearer acquires it.

Ring of Elemental Command (Earth)

-   *Meld into stone* (unlimited use, wearer only)
-   *Soften earth or stone* (unlimited use)
-   *Stone shape* (twice per day)
-   *Stoneskin* (once per week, wearer only)
-   *Passwall* (twice per week)
-   *Wall of stone* (once per day)

The ring appears to be a *ring of meld into stone* until the established
condition is met.

Ring of Elemental Command (Fire)

-   *Resist energy (fire)* (as a *major ring of energy resistance
    \[fire\]*)
-   *Burning hands* (unlimited use)
-   *Flaming sphere* (twice per day)
-   *Pyrotechnics* (twice per day)
-   *Wall of fire* (once per day)
-   *Flame strike* (twice per week)

The ring appears to be a *major ring of energy resistance (fire)* until
the established condition is met.

Ring of Elemental Command (Water)

-   *Water walk* (unlimited use)
-   *Create water* (unlimited use)
-   *Water breathing* (unlimited use)
-   *Wall of ice* (once per day)
-   *Ice storm* (twice per week)
-   *Control* water (twice per week)

The ring appears to be a *ring of water walking* until the established
condition is met.

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Forge Ring, *summon monster VI*, all
appropriate spells; Price 200,000 gp.

### Energy Resistance
This reddish iron ring continually protects the
wearer from damage from one type of energy---acid, cold, electricity,
fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if
found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally
take such damage, subtract the ring's resistance value from the damage
dealt.

A *minor ring of energy resistance* grants 10 points of resistance. A
*major ring of energy resistance* grants 20 points of resistance. A
*greater ring of energy resistance* grants 30 points of resistance.

Faint (minor or major) or moderate (greater) abjuration; CL 3rd (minor),
7th (major), or 11th (greater); Forge Ring, *resist energy;* Price
12,000 gp (minor), 28,000 gp (major), 44,000 gp (greater).

### Evasion
This ring continually grants the wearer the ability to
avoid damage as if she had evasion. Whenever she makes a Reflex saving
throw to determine whether she takes half damage, a successful save
results in no damage.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, *jump;* Price 25,000 gp.

### Feather Falling
This ring is crafted with a feather pattern all
around its edge. It acts exactly like a *feather fall* spell, activated
immediately if the wearer falls more than 5 feet.

Faint transmutation; CL 1st; Forge Ring, *feather fall;* Price 2,200 gp.

### Force Shield
An iron band, this simple ring generates a
shield-sized (and shield-shaped) *wall of force* that stays with the
ring and can be wielded by the wearer as if it were a heavy shield (+2
AC). This special creation has no armor check penalty or arcane spell
failure chance since it is weightless and encumbrance-free. It can be
activated and deactivated at will as a free action.

Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, *wall of force;* Price 8,500 gp.

### Freedom of Movement
This gold ring allows the wearer to act as if
continually under the effect of a *freedom of movement* spell.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Forge Ring, *freedom of movement;* Price
40,000 gp.

### Friend Shield
These curious rings always come in pairs. A *friend
shield* ring without its mate is useless. Either wearer of one of a pair
of the rings can, at any time, command his or her ring to cast a *shield
other* spell with the wearer of the mated ring as the recipient. This
effect has no range limitation.

Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Forge Ring, *shield other;* Price 50,000
gp (for a pair).

### Invisibility
By activating this simple silver ring, the wearer can
benefit from *invisibility*, as the spell.

Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, *invisibility;* Price 20,000 gp.

### Jumping
This ring continually allows the wearer to leap about,
providing a +5 competence bonus on all his Jump checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in
the Jump skill; Price 2,500 gp.

### Jumping, Improved
As jumping, except it grants a +10 competence
bonus on its wearer's Jump check.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks
in the Jump skill; Price 10,000 gp.

### Mind Shielding
This ring is usually of fine workmanship and wrought
from heavy gold. The wearer is continually immune to *detect thoughts,
discern lies,* and any attempt to magically discern her alignment.

Faint aburation; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, *nondetection;* Price 8,000 gp.

### Protection
This ring offers continual magical protection in the
form of a deflection bonus of +1 to +5 to AC.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Forge Ring, *shield of faith,* caster must be
of a level at least three times greater than the bonus of the ring;
Price 2,000 gp (*ring +1*); 8,000 gp (*ring +2*); 18,000 gp (*ring +3*);
32,000 gp (*ring +4*); 50,000 gp (*ring +5*).

### Ram
The *ring of the ram* is an ornate ring forged of hard metal,
usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device.

The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force,
manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a
ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of
damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6
points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged
attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance.

The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are
subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram
has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush
attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.

In addition to its attack mode, the *ring of the ram* also has the power
to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. If 2 charges
are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27.
If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with
Strength 29.

A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended,
the ring becomes a nonmagical item.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, *bull's strength,
telekinesis;* Price 8,600 gp.

### Regeneration
This white gold ring continually allows a living
wearer to heal 1 point of damage per level every hour rather than every
day. (This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage
heals at a rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes. If the
wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other body part while wearing this
ring, the ring *regenerates* it as the spell. In either case, only
damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated.

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Forge Ring, *regenerate;* Price 90,000 gp.

### Shooting Stars
This ring has two modes of operation, one for being
in shadowy darkness or outdoors at night and a second one when the
wearer is underground or indoors at night.

During the night under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness,
the *ring of shooting stars* can perform the following functions on
command.

-   *Dancing lights* (once per hour)
-   *Light* (twice per night)
-   *Ball lightning* (special, once per night)
-   *Shooting stars* (special, three per week)

The first special function, *ball lightning,* releases one to four balls
of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble
*dancing lights*, and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion
(see the *dancing lights* spell description). The spheres have a
120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet
per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who
comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking
electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls
created.

  ------------------- ---------------------------
  Number of Balls     Damage per Ball
  4 lightning balls   1d6 points of damage each
  3 lightning balls   2d6 points of damage each
  2 lightning balls   3d6 points of damage each
  1 lightning ball    4d6 points of damage
  ------------------- ---------------------------

Once the *ball lightning* function is activated, the balls can be
released at any time before the sun rises. (Multiple balls can be
released in the same round.)

The second special function produces three *shooting stars* that can be
released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They
impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a *fireball*) in a
5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.

Any creature struck by a *shooting star* takes full damage from impact
plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex
save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact
damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC
13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the *shooting
star* explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A
*shooting star* always follows a straight line, and any creature in its
path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.

Indoors at night, or underground, the *ring of shooting stars* has the
following properties.

-   *Faerie fire* (twice per day)
-   *Spark shower* (special, once per day)

The *spark shower* is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan
out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide.
Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing
metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or
carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.

Strong evocation; CL 12th; Forge Ring, *light, faerie fire, fireball,
lightning bolt;* Price 50,000 gp.

### Spell Storing, Minor
A *minor ring of spell storing* contains up to
three levels of spells that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster
level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user
need not provide any material components or focus, or pay an XP cost to
cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for wearing
armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time
for the ring is same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a
minimum of 1 standard action.

For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what
spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring
over the three-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more
spells in it. (Not every newly discovered ring need be fully charged.)

A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total
spell levels do not add up to more than three. Metamagic versions of
spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the
metamagic feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the
*minor ring of spell storing.*

The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells
currently stored within it.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, *imbue with spell ability;* Price
18,000 gp.

### Spell Storing
As the *minor ring of spell storing,* except it holds
up to five levels of spells.

Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, *imbue with spell ability;*
Price 50,000 gp.

### Spell Storing, Major
As the *minor ring of spell storing,* except
it holds up to ten levels of spells.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Forge Ring, *imbue with spell ability;* Price
200,000 gp.

### Spell Turning
Up to three times per day on command, this simple
platinum band automatically reflects the next nine levels of spells cast
at the wearer, exactly as if *spell turning* had been cast upon the
wearer.

Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Forge Ring, *spell turning;* Price 98,280
gp.

### Sustenance
This ring continually provides its wearer with
life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind,
so that its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit
of 8 hours of sleep. The ring must be worn for a full week before it
begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another
week to reattune it to himself.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Forge Ring, *create food and water;* Price
2,500 gp.

### Swimming
This silver ring has a wave pattern etched into the band.
It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in
the Swim skill; Price 2,500 gp.

### Swimming, Improved
As swimming, except it grants a +10 competence
bonus on its wearer's Swim checks.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks
in the Swim skill; Price 10,000 gp.

### Telekinesis
This ring allows the caster to use the spell
*telekinesis* on command.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, *telekinesis;* Price 75,000
gp.

### Three Wishes
This ring is set with three rubies. Each ruby stores a
*wish* spell, activated by the ring. When a *wish* is used, that ruby
disappears. For a randomly generated ring, roll 1d3 to determine the
remaining number of rubies. When all the *wishes* are used, the ring
becomes a nonmagical item.

Strong evocation (if *miracle* is used); CL 20th; Forge Ring, *wish* or
*miracle;* Price 97,950 gp; Cost 11,475 gp + 15,918 XP.

### Water Walking
This ring, set with an opal, allows the wearer to
continually utilize the effects of the spell *water walk*.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, *water walk;* Price 15,000
gp.

### Wizardry
This special ring comes in four kinds (*ring of wizardry
I, ring of wizardry II, ring of wizardry III,* and *ring of wizardry
IV*), all of them useful only to arcane spellcasters. The wearer's
arcane spells per day are doubled for one specific spell level. A *ring
of wizardry I* doubles 1st-level spells, a *ring of wizardry II* doubles
2nd-level spells, a *ring of wizardry III* doubles 3rd-level spells, and
a *ring of wizardry IV* doubles 4th-level spells. Bonus spells from high
ability scores or school specialization are not doubled.

Moderate (*wizardry I*) or strong (*wizardry II--IV*) (no school); CL
11th (I), 14th (*II*), 17th (*III*), 20th (*IV*); Forge Ring, *limited
wish*; Price 20,000 gp (I), 40,000 gp (*II*), 70,000 gp (*III*), 100,000
gp (*IV*).

### X-Ray Vision
On command, this ring gives its possessor the ability
to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the
viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if
there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1
inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker
substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks the vision.

Using the ring is physically exhausting, causing the wearer 1 point of
Constitution damage per minute after the first 10 minutes of use in a
single day.

Moderate divination; CL 6th; Forge Ring, *true seeing;* Price 25,000 gp.

## Rods

Rods are scepterlike devices that have unique magical powers and do not
usually have charges. Anyone can use a rod.

### Physical Description
Rods weigh approximately 5 pounds.

They range from 2 feet to 3 feet long and are usually made of iron or
some other metal. (Many, as noted in their descriptions, can function as
light maces or clubs due to their sturdy construction.)

These sturdy items have AC 9, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC
of 27.

### Activation
Details relating to rod use vary from item to item. See
the individual descriptions for specifics.

### Special Qualities
Roll d%. A 01 result indicates the rod is
intelligent, 02--31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or
the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32--100 indicates no
special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes
extraordinary powers and special purposes.

Rods with charges can never be intelligent.

## Rod Descriptions

Although all rods are generally scepterlike, their configurations and
abilities run the magical gamut. Standard rods are described below.

### Absorption
This rod acts as a magnet, drawing spells or spell-like
abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell
or a ray directed at either the character possessing the rod or her
gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores its potential
until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own.
She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's
energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod
is in hand at the time.

A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The
wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she
has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only
restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must
be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to
cast, that any material components required for the spell be present,
and that the rod be in hand when casting. For casters such as bards or
sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to
cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.

A *rod of absorption* absorbs a maximum of fifty spell levels and can
thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod
cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing
potential and current amount of stored energy.

To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod,
roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: On a result of
71--100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored
within.

Strong abjuration; CL 15th;Craft Rod, *spell turning;* Price 50,000 gp.

### Alertness
This rod is indistinguishable from a *+1 light mace.* It
has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows a +1 insight
bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, the rod enables the
holder to use *detect evil, detect good, detect chaos, detect law*,
*detect magic, discern lies, light,* or *see invisibility.* Each
different use is a standard action.

If the head of a *rod of alertness* is planted in the ground, and the
possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any
creature within 120 feet who intends to harm the possessor. At the same
time, the rod creates the effect of a *prayer* spell upon all creatures
friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter,
the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning
them of possible danger from the unfriendly creature or creatures within
the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can
perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to
simulate the casting of an *animate objects* spell, utilizing any eleven
(or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a
5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground.
Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function
once per day.

Moderate abjuration, divination, enchantment, and evocation; CL 11th;
Craft Rod, *alarm, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law,
detect magic, discern lies, light, see invisibility, prayer, animate
objects;* Price 85,000 gp.

### Cancellation
This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its
touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must
make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a
creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's
Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such
cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon
draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used
again. Drained items are only restorable by *wish*or *miracle.* (If a
*sphere of annihilation* and a *rod of cancellation* negate each other,
nothing can restore either of them.)

Strong abjuration; CL 17th; Craft Rod, *mage's disjunction;* Price
11,000 gp.

### Enemy Detection
This device pulses in the wielder's hand and points
in the direction of any creature or creatures hostile to the bearer of
the device (nearest ones first). These creatures can be invisible,
ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is 60
feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for a full round, the rod
pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many
enemies are within range. The rod can be used three times each day, each
use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a standard action.

Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Rod, *true seeing;* Price 23,500 gp.

### Flailing
Upon the command of its possessor, the rod activates,
changing from a normal-seeming rod to a *+3 dire flail*. The dire flail
is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads can be
used to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second
head) at the cost of making all attacks at a --2 penalty (as if she had
the Two-Weapon Fighting feat).

Once per day the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant
her a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on
saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod need not be in weapon form to
grant this benefit.

Transforming it into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action.

Moderate enchantment; CL 9th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
*bless;* Price 50,000 gp.

### Flame Extinguishing
This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller
nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to
be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or
more of the rod's charges.

Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire, or a magic fire of
Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a *burning hands*
spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those of a
weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up
again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the
rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used
a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.

When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by
*fireball, flame strike,* or *wall of fire*, extinguishing the flames
expends 2 charges from the rod.

If the device is used upon a fire creature (a melee touch attack), it
deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.

A *rod of flame extinguishing* has 10 charges when found. Spent charges
are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in
any 24-hour period.

Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Rod, *pyrotechnics;* Price 15,000
gp.

### Immovable Rod
This rod is a flat iron bar with a small button on
one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not
move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus,
the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button,
and let go. Several *immovable rods* can even make a ladder when used
together (although only two are needed). An *immovable rod* can support
up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes
against an *immovable rod,* it must make a DC 30 Strength check to move
the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Rod, *levitate;* Price 5,000 gp.

### Lordly Might
This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can
also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. It also has several
more mundane uses. The *rod of lordly might* is metal, thicker than
other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons
along its length. (Pushing any of the rod's buttons is equivalent to
drawing a weapon.) It weighs 10 pounds.

The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per
day.

-   *Hold person* upon touch, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14
    negates). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed
    on a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails,
    the effect is lost.
-   *Fear* upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires
    (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is
    a standard action.
-   Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch
    attack (Will DC 17 half ) and cure the wielder of a like amount of
    damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking,
    as with *hold person.*

The following weapon functions of the rod have no limit on the number of
times they can be employed.

-   In its normal form, the rod can be used as a *+2 light mace.*
-   When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a *+1 flaming longsword.* A
    blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the
    sword's hilt. The weapon lengthens to an overall length of 4 feet.
-   When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a *+4 battleaxe.* A wide
    blade springs forth at the ball, and the whole lengthens to 4 feet.
-   When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a *+3 shortspear* or *+3
    longspear.* The spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be
    lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice), for an overall length
    of from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is
    suitable for use as a lance.

The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the
number of times they can be employed.

-   Climbing pole/ladder. When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can
    anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end
    sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5
    and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed
    again. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, 1
    foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the
    spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can
    retract the pole by pushing button 5.
-   The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder
    plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced
    and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a
    Strength modifier of +12.
-   When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives
    the wielder a knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface
    or height above it.

Strong enchantment, evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; CL 19th;
Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, *inflict light wounds, bull's
strength, flame blade, hold person, fear;* Price 70,000 gp.

### Metal and Mineral Detection
This rod pulses in the wielder's hand
and points to the largest mass of metal within 30 feet. However, the
wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. If the specific
mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located,
and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well. If more than
one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod
points to the largest cache first. Each operation requires a full-round
action.

Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Rod, *locate object;* Price 10,500
gp.

### Metamagic Rods
Metamagic rods hold the essence of a metamagic feat
but do not change the spell slot of the altered spell. All the rods
described here are use-activated (but casting spells in a threatened
area still draws an attack of opportunity). A caster may only use one
metamagic rod on any given spell, but it is permissible to combine a rod
with metamagic feats possessed by the rod's wielder. In this case, only
the feats possessed by the wielder adjust the spell slot of the spell
being cast.

Possession of a metamagic rod does not confer the associated feat on the
owner, only the ability to use the given feat a specified number of
times per day. A sorcerer still must take a full-round action when using
a metamagic rod, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses.

*Lesser and Greater Metamagic Rods:* Normal metamagic rods can be used
with spells of 6th level or lower. Lesser rods can be used with spells
of 3rd level or lower, while greater rods can be used with spells of 9th
level or lower.

### Metamagic, Empower
The wielder can cast up to three spells per day
that are empowered as though using the Empower Spell feat.

Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Empower Spell; Price 9,000 gp
(lesser), 32,500 gp (normal), 73,000 gp (greater).

### Metamagic, Enlarge
The wielder can cast up to three spells per day
that are enlarged as though using the Enlarge Spell feat.

Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Enlarge Spell; Price 3,000 gp
(lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).

### Metamagic, Extend
The wielder can cast up to three spells per day
that are extended as though using the Extend Spell feat.

Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Extend Spell; Price 3,000 gp
(lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).

### Metamagic, Maximize
The wielder can cast up to three spells per day
that are maximized as though using the Maximize Spell feat.

Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Maximize Spell feat; Price
14,000 gp (lesser), 54,000 gp (normal), 121,500 gp (greater).

### Metamagic, Quicken
The wielder can cast up to three spells per day
that are quickened as though using the Quicken Spell feat.

Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Quicken Spell; Price 35,000 gp
(lesser), 75,500 gp (normal), 170,000 gp (greater).

### Metamagic, Silent
The wielder can cast up to three spells per day
without verbal components as though using the Silent Spell feat.

Strong (no school); CL 17th; Craft Rod, Silent Spell; Price 3,000 gp
(lesser), 11,000 gp (normal), 24,500 gp (greater).

### Negation
This device negates the spell or spell-like function or
functions of magic items. The wielder points the rod at the magic item,
and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking
as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a *greater dispel
magic* spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate
instantaneous effects from an item, the rod wielder needs to have used a
ready action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The
target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate
artifacts (even minor artifacts). The rod can function three times per
day.

Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Rod, *dispel magic,* and *limited wish* or
*miracle;* Price 37,000 gp.

### Python
This rod is longer than normal rods. It is about 4 feet long
and weighs 10 pounds. It strikes as a *+1/+1 quarterstaff*. If the user
throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it grows to become a
giant constrictor snake by the end of the round. The python obeys all
commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement
bonus on attacks and damage possessed by the rod form.) The serpent
returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires,
or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the owner. If the snake
form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for
three days. A *python rod* only functions if the possessor is good.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
*baleful polymorph,* creator must be good; Price 13,000 gp.

### Rulership
This rod looks like a royal scepter worth at least 5,000
gp in materials and workmanship alone. The wielder can command the
obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when she activates the
device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice can be
ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher are
entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey
the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the
wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures
commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 500 total
minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous.

Strong enchantment; CL 20th; Craft Rod, *mass charm monster;* Price
60,000 gp; Cost 27,500 gp + 2,200 XP.

### Security
This item creates a nondimensional space, a pocket
paradise. There the rod's possessor and as many as 199 other creatures
can stay in complete safety for a period of time, up to 200 days divided
by the number of creatures affected. All fractions are rounded down.

In this pocket paradise, creatures don't age, and natural healing take
place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and
vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all
creatures involved.

Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all
creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the
paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain
physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a
chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will
save to negate the effect. If such a creature succeeds on its save,
other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by
the rod.

When the rod's effect expires or is dispelled, all the affected
creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod
was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler
would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance
to provide the space required for reentry. The rod's possessor can
dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period
expires, but the rod can only be activated once per week.

Strong conjuuration; CL 20th; Craft Rod, *gate;* Price 61,000 gp.

### Splendor
The possessor of this rod gains a +4 enhancement bonus to
her Charisma score for as long as she holds or carries the item. Once
per day, the rod creates and garbs her in clothing of the finest
fabrics, plus adornments of furs and jewels.

Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12
hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell or give away any part
of it, to use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel
immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken
from her.

The value of noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000
gp (1d4+6 x 1,000 gp)---1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the
furs, and the rest for the jewel trim (maximum of twenty gems, maximum
value 200 gp each).

In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week.
Upon command, it creates a palatial tent---a huge pavilion of silk 60
feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable
to the splendor of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as
one hundred persons. The tent and its trappings last for one day. At the
end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including
any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear.

Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Rod, *eagle's
splendor, fabricate, major creation;* Price 25,000 gp.

### Thunder and Lightning
Constructed of iron set with silver rivets,
this rod has the properties of a *+2 light mace*. Its other magical
powers are as follows.

-   *Thunder:* Once per day, the rod can strike as a *+3 light mace,*
    and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's
    impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a
    free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within
    1 round.
-   *Lightning:* Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark
    of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to
    deal the normal damage for a *+2 light mace* (1d6+2) and an extra
    2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score
    a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a
    successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of
    electricity damage still applies. The wielder activates this power
    as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1
    round.
-   *Thunderclap:* Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can
    cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a *shout* spell
    (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target
    deafened for 2d6 rounds).
-   *Lightning Stroke:* Once per day as a standard action, the wielder
    can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6
    points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200
    feet.
-   *Thunder and Lightning:* Once per week as a standard action, the
    wielder of the rod can combine the *thunderclap* described above
    with a lightning bolt, as in the *lightning stroke.* The thunderclap
    affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The *lightning stroke* deals
    9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of
    3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the *thunderclap* deals 2d6
    points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both
    effects.

Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
*lightning bolt*, *shout*; Price 33,000 gp.

### Viper
This rod strikes as a *+2 heavy mace*. Once per day, upon
command, the head of the rod becomes that of an actual serpent for 10
minutes. During this period, any successful strike with the rod deals
its usual damage and also poisons the creature hit. The poison deals
1d10 points of Constitution damage immediately (Fortitude DC 14 negates)
and another 1d10 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later (Fortitude
DC 14 negates). The rod only functions if its possessor is evil.

Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
*poison,* creator must be evil; Price 19,000 gp.

### Withering
A *rod of withering* acts as a *+1 light mace* that deals
no hit point damage. Instead, the wielder deals 1d4 points of Strength
damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage to any creature she touches
with the rod (by making a melee touch attack). If she scores a critical
hit, the damage from that hit is permanent ability drain. In either
case, the defender negates the effect with a DC 17 Fortitude save.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
*contagion;* Price 25,000 gp.

### Wonder
A *rod of wonder* is a strange and unpredictable device that
randomly generates any number of weird effects each time it is used.
(Activating the rod is a standard action.) Typical powers of the rod
include the following.

  --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d%        Wondrous Effect
  01--05    *Slow* creature pointed at for 10 rounds (Will DC 15 negates).
  06--10    *Faerie fire* surrounds the target.
  11--15    Deludes wielder for 1 round into believing the rod functions as indicated by a second die roll (no save).
  16--20    *Gust of wind,* but at windstorm force (Fortitude DC 14 negates).
  21--25    Wielder learns target's surface thoughts (as with *detect thoughts)* for 1d4 rounds (no save).
  26--30    *Stinking cloud* at 30-ft. range (Fortitude DC 15 negates).
  31--33    Heavy rain falls for 1 round in 60-ft. radius centered on rod wielder.
  34--36    *Summon* an animal---a rhino (01--25 on d%), elephant (26--50), or mouse (51--100).
  37--46    *Lightning bolt* (70 ft. long, 5 ft. wide), 6d6 damage (Reflex DC 15 half).
  47--49    Stream of 600 large butterflies pours forth and flutters around for 2 rounds, blinding everyone (including wielder) within 25 ft. (Reflex DC 14 negates).
  50--53    *Enlarge person* if within 60 ft. of rod (Fortitude DC 13 negates).
  54--58    *Darkness*, 30-ft.-diameter hemisphere, centered 30 ft. away from rod.
  59--62    Grass grows in 160-sq.-ft. area before the rod, or grass existing there grows to ten times normal size.
  63--65    Turn ethereal any nonliving object of up to 1,000 lb. mass and up to 30 cu. ft. in size.
  66--69    Reduce wielder to 1/12 height (no save).
  70--79    *Fireball* at target or 100 ft. straight ahead, 6d6 damage (Reflex DC 15 half).
  80--84    *Invisibility* covers rod wielder.
  85--87    Leaves grow from target if within 60 ft. of rod. These last 24 hours.
  88--90    10--40 gems, value 1 gp each, shoot forth in a 30-ft.-long stream. Each gem deals 1 point of damage to any creature in its path: Roll 5d4 for the number of hits and divide them among the available targets.
  91--95    Shimmering colors dance and play over a 40-ft.-by-30-ft. area in front of rod. Creatures therein are blinded for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 15 negates).
  96--97    Wielder (50% chance) or target (50% chance) turns permanently blue, green, or purple (no save).
  98--100   *Flesh to stone* (or *stone to flesh* if target is stone already) if target is within 60 ft. (Fortitude DC 18 negates).
  --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate enchantment; CL 10th; Craft Rod, *confusion*, creator must be
chaotic; Price 12,000 gp.
