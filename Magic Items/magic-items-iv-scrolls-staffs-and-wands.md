## Scrolls

A scroll is a spell (or collection of spells) that has been stored in
written form. A spell on a scroll can be used only once. The writing
vanishes from the scroll when the spell is activated. Using a scroll is
basically like casting a spell.

### Physical Description
A scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or
high-quality paper. An area about 8 1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long
is sufficient to hold one spell. The sheet is reinforced at the top and
bottom with strips of leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide. A
scroll holding more than one spell has the same width (about 8 1/2
inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each extra spell. Scrolls
that hold three or more spells are usually fitted with reinforcing rods
at each end rather than simple strips of leather. A scroll has AC 9, 1
hit point, hardness 0, and a break DC of 8.

To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both
ends to form a double cylinder. (This also helps the user unroll the
scroll quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather,
metal, or wood. Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols which
often identify the owner or the spells stored on the scrolls inside. The
symbols often hide magic traps.

### Activation
To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell
written on it. Doing so involves several steps and conditions.

*Decipher the Writing:* The writing on a scroll must be deciphered
before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains.
This requires a *read magic* spell or a successful Spellcraft check (DC
20 + spell level).

Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its
magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can
decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that he or she can
proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.

*Activate the Spell:* Activating a scroll requires reading the spell
from the scroll. The character must be able to see and read the writing
on the scroll. Activating a scroll spell requires no material components
or focus. (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the
scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item
or items. In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when
activating the spell. Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption
just as casting a normally prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is
like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.

To have any chance of activating a scroll spell, the scroll user must
meet the following requirements.

-   The spell must be of the correct type (arcane or divine). Arcane
    spellcasters (wizards, sorcerers, and bards) can only use scrolls
    containing arcane spells, and divine spellcasters (clerics, druids,
    paladins, and rangers) can only use scrolls containing divine
    spells. (The type of scroll a character creates is also determined
    by his or her class.)
-   The user must have the spell on his or her class list.
-   The user must have the requisite ability score.

If the user meets all the requirements noted above, and her caster level
is at least equal to the spell's caster level, she can automatically
activate the spell without a check. If she meets all three requirements
but her own caster level is lower than the scroll spell's caster level,
then she has to make a caster level check (DC = scroll's caster
level + 1) to cast the spell successfully. If she fails, she must make a
DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps, below). A
natural roll of 1 always fails, whatever the modifiers.

*Determine Effect:* A spell successfully activated from a scroll works
exactly like a spell prepared and cast the normal way. Assume the scroll
spell's caster level is always the minimum level required to cast the
spell for the character who scribed the scroll (usually twice the
spell's level, minus 1), unless the caster specifically desires
otherwise.

The writing for an activated spell disappears from the scroll.

*Scroll Mishaps:* When a mishap occurs, the spell on the scroll has a
reversed or harmful effect. Possible mishaps are given below.

-   A surge of uncontrolled magical energy deals 1d6 points of damage
    per spell level to the scroll user.
-   Spell strikes the scroll user or an ally instead of the intended
    target, or a random target nearby if the scroll user was the
    intended recipient.
-   Spell takes effect at some random location within spell range.
-   Spell's effect on the target is contrary to the spell's normal
    effect.
-   The scroll user suffers some minor but bizarre effect related to the
    spell in some way. Most such effects should last only as long as the
    original spell's duration, or 2d10 minutes for instantaneous spells.
-   Some innocuous item or items appear in the spell's area.
-   Spell has delayed effect. Sometime within the next 1d12 hours, the
    spell activates. If the scroll user was the intended recipient, the
    spell takes effect normally. If the user was not the intended
    recipient, the spell goes off in the general direction of the
    original recipient or target, up to the spell's maximum range, if
    the target has moved away.

Several arcane spells are different in level for sorcerers and wizards
than they are for bards. Such spells appear on the table at the level
appropriate to a sorcerer or wizard (considered the default because
bards typically don't involve themselves in scribing scrolls).

Likewise, some divine spells are different in level for clerics and
druids than they are for paladins and rangers. Such spells appear at the
level appropriate to a cleric or druid (considered the default because
paladins and rangers typically don't involve themselves in scribing
scrolls).

If a divine spell is cast at different levels by clerics and druids, it
appears at the level appropriate to a cleric (considered the default
choice between clerics and druids).

Many spells are either arcane or divine, depending on the class of the
caster. Such spells appear on both lists at the level appropriate to the
class of the arcane or divine caster.

## Staffs

A staff is a long shaft of wood that stores several spells. Unlike
wands, which can contain a wide variety of spells, each staff is of a
certain kind and holds specific spells. A staff has 50 charges when
created.

### Physical Description
A typical staff is 4 feet to 7 feet long and 2
inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds. Most staffs are wood,
but a rare few are bone, metal, or even glass. (These are extremely
exotic.) Staffs often have a gem or some device at their tip or are shod
in metal at one or both ends. Staffs are often decorated with carvings
or runes. A typical staff is like a walking stick, quarterstaff, or
cudgel. It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.

### Activation
Staffs use the spell trigger activation method, so
casting a spell from a staff is usually a standard action that doesn't
provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast, however, has a
longer casting time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to cast
the spell from a staff.) To activate a staff, a character must hold it
forth in at least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for
nonhumanoid creatures).

### Special Qualities
Roll d%. A 01--30 result indicates that something
(a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the staff 's
function, and 31--100 indicates no special qualities.

## Staff Descriptions

Staffs use the wielder's ability score and relevant feats to set the DC
for saves against their spells. Unlike with other sorts of magic items,
the wielder can use his caster level when activating the power of a
staff if it's higher than the caster level of the staff.

This means that staffs are far more potent in the hands of a powerful
spellcaster. Because they use the wielder's ability score to set the
save DC for the spell, spells from a staff are often harder to resist
than ones from other magic items, which use the minimum ability score
required to cast the spell. Not only are aspects of the spell dependant
on caster level (range, duration, and so on) potentially higher, but
spells from a staff are harder to dispel and have a better chance of
overcoming a target's spell resistance.

Furthermore, a staff can hold a spell of any level, unlike a wand, which
is limited to spells of 4th level or lower. The minimum caster level of
a staff is 8th. Standard staffs are described below.

### Power
The *staff of power* is a very potent magic item, with
offensive and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a
glistening gem, its shaft straight and smooth. It has the following
powers:

-   *Magic missile* (1 charge)
-   *Ray of enfeeblement* (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
-   *Continual flame* (1 charge)
-   *Levitate* (1 charge)

-   *Fireball* (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
-   *Cone of cold* (2 charges)
-   *Hold monster* (2 charges)
-   *Wall of force* (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster
    only) (2 charges)
-   *Globe of invulnerability* (2 charges)

The wielder of a *staff of power* gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and saving
throws. The staff is also a *+2 quarterstaff,* and its wielder may use
it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the
staff causes double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.

A *staff of power* can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to
be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful
and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action
that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges
currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot radius. All
within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 x
the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 6 x
the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 4
x the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17
Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.

The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to
another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of
spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the *staff of
the magi* and the *staff of power,* are capable of being used for a
retributive strike.

After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a *+2
quarterstaff*. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a
retributive strike.)

Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Staff, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, *magic
missile,* heightened *ray of enfeeblement, continual flame, levitate,*

## Wands

A wand is a thin baton that contains a single spell of 4th level or
lower. Each wand has 50 charges when created, and each charge expended
allows the user to use the wand's spell one time. A wand that runs out
of charges is just a stick.

### Physical Description
A typical wand is 6 inches to 12 inches long
and about 1/4 inch thick, and often weighs no more than 1 ounce. Most
wands are wood, but some are bone. A rare few are metal, glass, or even
ceramic, but these are quite exotic. Occasionally, a wand has a gem or
some device at its tip, and most are decorated with carvings or runes. A
typical wand has AC 7, 5 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 16.

### Activation
Wands use the spell trigger activation method, so
casting a spell from a wand is usually a standard action that doesn't
provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast, however, has a
longer casting time than 1 action, it takes that long to cast the spell
from a wand.) To activate a wand, a character must hold it in hand (or
whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures) and point it in
the general direction of the target or area. A wand may be used while
grappling or while swallowed whole.

### Special Qualities
Roll d%. A 01--30 result indicates that something
(a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the wand's
function, and 31--100 indicates no special qualities.
