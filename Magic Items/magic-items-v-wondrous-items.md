## Wondrous Items

This is a catch-all category for anything that doesn't fall into the
other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise
in the description).

### Physical Description
 Varies.

### Activation
 Usually use activated or command word, but details vary
from item to item.

### Special Qualities
 Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item
is intelligent, 02--31 indicates that something (a design, inscription,
or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32--100 indicates no
special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes
extraordinary powers and special purposes.

Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.

gp (+5).

### Amulet of the Planes
 This device usually appears to be a black
circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a
dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize
*plane shift*. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user
must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take
her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she
wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling
with her to a random location on that plane (01--60 on d%) or to a
random plane (61--100).

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, *plane shift;* Price
120,000 gp.

### Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location
 This silver amulet
protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a
*nondetection* spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against
the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had
cast *nondetection* on herself ).

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, *nondetection;* Price
35,000 gp.

### Apparatus of the Crab
 This item appears to be a large, sealed iron
barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate) that opens a
hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers:
The device has the following characteristics: hp 200; hardness 15; Spd
20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (--1 size, +11 natural); Atk +12 melee (2d8,
2 pincers).

  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
|Lever (1d10)||Lever Function|

  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------

Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated
more than once per round. However, since two Medium characters can fit
inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device
can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a
crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single
occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant
lobster.

Strong evocation and transmutation; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item,

Knowledge (architecture and engineering) skill; Price 90,000 gp;*Weight*

### Bag of Holding
 This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet
by 4 feet in size. The *bag of holding* opens into a nondimensional
space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of
what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the
limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's
type, as shown on the table below.

  ---------- ------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- --------------
|Bag        Bag Weight   Contents Weight Limit   Contents Volume Limit||Market Price|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Type I     15 lb.       250 lb.                 30 cu. ft.           ||2,500 gp|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Type II    25 lb.       500 lb.                 70 cu. ft.           ||5,000 gp|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Type III   35 lb.       1,000 lb.               150 cu. ft.          ||7,400 gp|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Type IV    60 lb.       1,500 lb.               250 cu. ft.          ||10,000 gp|
| --- | --- | --- |
  ---------- ------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- --------------

If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or
outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever.
If a *bag of holding* is turned inside out, its contents spill out,
unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If
living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to
10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item
from a *bag of holding* is a move action---unless the bag contains more
than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a
specific item is a full-round action.

If a *bag of holding* is placed within a *portable hole* a rift to the
Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into
the void and forever lost. If a *portable hole* is placed within a *bag
of holding,* it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and
any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the
*portable hole* and *bag of holding* in the process.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *secret chest.*

### Bag of Tricks
 This small sack appears normal and empty. However,
anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is
removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The
animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or
until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears.
It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill.
Each of the three kinds of a *bag of tricks* produces a different set of
animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn
out of each.

The heavy warhorse appears with harness and tack and accepts the
character who drew it from the bag as a rider.

Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up
to ten animals can be drawn from the bag each week.

Faint or moderate conjuration; CL 3rd (gray), 5th (rust), 9th (tan);
Craft Wondrous Item, *summon nature's ally II* (gray), *summon nature's
ally III* (rust), or *summon nature's ally* V (tan); Price 900 gp
(gray); 3,000 gp (rust); 6,300 gp (tan).

### Bead of Force
 This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless
pearl. You can throw it up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon
sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6
points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.

It functions like a *resilient sphere* spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with
a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering
force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit
within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for
the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort
except from a *rod of cancellation,* a *rod of negation, disintegrate,*
or a targeted *dispel magic* spell. These effects destroy the sphere
without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside
or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may
struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people
outside it or by the struggles of those within.

The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *resilient sphere;*
Price 3,000 gp.

### Belt, Monk's
 This simple rope belt, when wrapped around a
character's waist, confers great ability in unarmed combat. The wearer's
AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If
donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the belt lets her
make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a
monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk. This AC
bonus functions just like the monk's AC bonus.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *righteous might*
or *transformation;* Price 13,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Belt of Dwarvenkind
 This belt gives the wearer a +4 competence
bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks as they relate
to dealing with dwarves, a +2 competence bonus on similar checks when
dealing with gnomes and halflings, and a --2 competence penalty on
similar checks when dealing with anyone else. The wearer can understand,
speak, and read Dwarven. If the wearer is not a dwarf, he gains 60-foot
darkvision, dwarven stonecunning, a +2 enhancement bonus to
Constitution, and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against poison, spells,
or spell-like effects.

Moderate divination; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, *tongues*, creator
must be a dwarf; Price 14,900 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Belt of Giant Strength
 This wide belt is made of thick leather and
studded with iron. The belt adds to the wearer's Strength score in the
form of an enhancement bonus of +4 or +6.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *bull's strength;*
Price 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6);Weight 1 lb.

### Blessed Book
 This well-made tome is always of small size, typically
no more than 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. All such
books are durable, waterproof, bound with iron overlaid with silver, and
locked.

A wizard can fill the 1,000 pages of a *blessed book* with spells
without paying the 100 gp per page material cost. This book is never
found as randomly generated treasure with spells already inscribed in
it.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *secret page;*
Price 12,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Boat, Folding
 A folding boat looks like a small wooden box---about
12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It can be used to
store items like any other box. If a command word is given, however, the
box unfolds itself to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet
in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold to a ship 24 feet
long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Any objects formerly stored in the
box now rest inside the boat or ship.

In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast,
and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single
rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck
cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people
comfortably, while the ship carries fifteen with ease.

A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a
box once again.

Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *fabricate*, creator
must have 2 ranks in the Craft (shipmaking) skill; Price 7,200 gp;Weight
4 lb.

### Boots of Elvenkind
 These soft boots enable the wearer to move
quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a +5 competence bonus on
Move Silently checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be an
elf; Price 2,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Boots of Levitation
 On command, these leather boots allow the
wearer to levitate as if she had cast *levitate* on herself.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *levitate;* Price
7,500 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Boots of Speed
 As a free action, the wearer can click her boot
heels together, enabling her to act as though affected by a *haste*
spell for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the *haste* effect
need not be consecutive rounds.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *haste;* Price
12,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Boots of Striding and Springing
 These boots increase the wearer's
base land speed by 10 feet. In addition to this striding ability
(considered an enhancement bonus), these boots allow the wearer to make
great leaps. She can jump with a +5 competence bonus on Jump checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *longstrider*, creator
must have 5 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 5,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Boots of Teleportation
 Any character wearing this footwear may
*teleport* three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of
the same name.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *teleport;* Price
49,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Boots of the Winterlands
 This footgear bestows many powers upon the
wearer. First, he is able to travel across snow at his normal speed,
leaving no tracks. The boots also enable him to travel at normal speed
across the most slippery ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or
sharply slanted ones) without falling or slipping. Finally, *boots of
the winterlands* warm the wearer, as if he were affected by an *endure
elements* spell.

Faint abjuration and transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *cat's
grace, endure elements, pass without trace;* Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1
lb.

### Boots, Winged
These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. On
command, the boots sprout wings at the heel and let the wearer fly,
without having to maintain concentration, as if affected by a *fly*
spell. He can fly three times day for up to 5 minutes per flight.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *fly;* Price 16,000
gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Bottle of Air

This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a
cork. When taken to any airless environment it retains air within it at
all times, continually renewing its contents. This means that a
character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The bottle can even
be shared by multiple characters who pass it around. Breathing out of
the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can then act
for as long as she can hold her breath.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *water breathing;*
Price 7,250 gp;Weight 2 lb.

### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
 This large container is usually
fashioned from blue or green semiprecious stone. It is about 1 foot in
diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is
filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a Large water
elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In
all ways the bowl functions as the *summon monster VI* spell. Only one
elemental can be called at a time. A new elemental requires the bowl to
be filled with new water, which cannot happen until after the first
elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

If salt water is used, the elemental is Huge rather than Large (as if
*summon monster VII* had been cast).

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *summon monster VI,
summon monster VII;* Price 100,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.

### Bracelet of Friends
 This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon
it when created. The owner may designate one person known to him to be
keyed to one charm. (This designation takes a standard action, but once
done it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is grasped and the
name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the
spot (a standard action) along with his or her gear, as long as the
owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual
knows who is calling, and the *bracelet of friends* only functions on
willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms
separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer
than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm.

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, *refuge;* Price 19,000
gp.

### Bracers of Archery, Greater
 These wristbands look like normal
protective wear. The bracers empower the wearer to use any bow (not
including crossbows) as if she were proficient in its use. If she
already has proficiency with any type of bow, she gains a +2 competence
bonus on attack rolls and a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls whenever
using that type of bow. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be
effective.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms
and Armor; Price 25,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Bracers of Archery, Lesser
 These wristbands function as *greater
bracers of archery*, except that they grant a +1 competence bonus on
attack rolls and no bonus on damage rolls.

Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and
Armor; Price 5,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Bracers of Armor
 These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. They
surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force,
granting him an armor bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were wearing
armor. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *mage armor*,
creator's caster level must be at least two times that of the bonus
placed in the bracers; Price 1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp
(+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5), 36,000 gp (+6), 49,000 gp (+7),
64,000 gp (+8);Weight 1 lb.

### Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
 This device appears to be a
normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the
brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a Large fire
elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In
all ways the brazier functions as the *summon monster VI* spell. If
brimstone is added, the elemental is Huge instead of Large, and the
brazier works as a *summon monster* VII spell. Only one elemental can be
summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new fire, which cannot be
lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed,
or slain).

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *summon monster VI,
summon monster VII;* Price 100,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.

### Brooch of Shielding
 This appears to be a piece of silver or gold
jewelry used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this mundane
task, it can absorb *magic missiles* of the sort generated by spell or
spell-like ability. A brooch can absorb up to 101 points of damage from
*magic missiles* before it melts and becomes useless.

Faint abjuration; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, *shield;* Price 1,500 gp.

### Broom of Flying
 This broom is able to fly through the air as if
affected by*an overland flight* spell (average maneuverability) for up
to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry
200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed
at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination
named by the owner as long as she has a good idea of the location and
layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as
300 yards when she speaks the command word. The *broom of flying* has a
speed of 40 feet when it has no rider.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *overland flight,
permanency;* Price 17,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Candle of Invocation
 Each of these special tapers is dedicated to
one of the nine alignments. Simply burning the candle generates a
favorable aura for the individual so doing if the candle's alignment
matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the
burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and
skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame.

A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels
higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle
during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast
spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of that higher level,
but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special
cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours.

In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a *gate*
spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the
taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to
extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it
in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't
interfere with its magical properties.

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, *gate,* creator must
be same alignment as candle created; Price 8,400 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

### Candle of Truth
 This white tallow candle, when burned, calls into
place a *zone of truth* spell (Will DC 13 negates) in a 5-foot radius
centered on the candle. The zone lasts for 1 hour, as the candle burns.
If the candle is snuffed before that time, the effect is canceled and
the candle ruined.

Faint enchantment; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *zone of truth;* Price
2,500 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

### Cape of the Mountebank
 On command, this bright red and gold cape
allows the wearer to use the magic of the *dimension door* spell once
per day. When he disappears, he leaves behind a cloud of smoke,
appearing in a similar fashion at his destination.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *dimension door;*
Price 10,080 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Carpet of Flying
 This rug is able to fly through the air as if
affected by an *overland flight* spell of unlimited duration. The size,
carrying capacity, and speed of the different *carpets of flying* are
shown on the table below. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet
has its own command word to activate it---if the device is within voice
range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug
or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.

  ------------------ ---------- -------- -------- --------------
|Size               Capacity   Speed    Weight||Market Price|
| --- | --- | --- |
|5 ft. by 5 ft.     200 lb.    40 ft.   8 lb. ||20,000 gp|
| --- | --- | --- |
|5 ft. by 10 ft.    400 lb.    40 ft.   15 lb.||35,000 gp|
| --- | --- | --- |
|10 ft. by 10 ft.   800 lb.    40 ft.   10 lb.||60,000 gp|
| --- | --- | --- |
  ------------------ ---------- -------- -------- --------------

A *carpet of flying* can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so
reduces its speed to 30 feet. It has average maneuverability, but a
*carpet of flying* can still hover.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *overland flight*,
*permanency*.

### Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
 This 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high
perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of
worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken
over it summon forth a Large air elemental. The summoning words require
1 full round to speak. In all ways the censer functions as the *summon
monster VI* spell. If *incense of meditation* is burned within the
censer, the air elemental is an elder air elemental instead (as if
*summon monster IX* had just been cast). Only one elemental can be
summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new piece of incense,
which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is
dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, *summon monster VI,
summon monster IX;* Price 100,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Chaos Diamond
 This lustrous gemstone is uncut and about the size of
a human fist. The gem grants its possessor the following powers:

-   *Confusion, lesser*
-   *Magic circle against law*
-   *Word of chaos*
-   *Cloak of chaos*

Each power is usable 1d4 times per day. This is rolled for each power
individually and the character does not

A nonchaotic character who possesses a *chaos diamond* gains one
negative level. Although this level never results in actual level loss,
it remains as long as the diamond is in the character's possession and
cannot be overcome in any way (including *restoration* spells).

Strong varied; CL 19th; Craft Wondrous Item, *cloak of chaos, magic
circle against law, random action, word of chaos,* creator must be
chaotic; Price 160,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Chime of Interruption
 This instrument can be struck once every 10
minutes, and its resonant tone lasts for 3 full minutes.

While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a verbal component can
be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster can make a
Concentration check (DC 15 + the spell's level).

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *shout;* Price 16,800
gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Chime of Opening
 A *chime of opening* is a hollow mithral tube
about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that
cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device
functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A
*chime of opening* also automatically dispels a *hold portal* spell or
even an *arcane lock* cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.

The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened
(which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck,
a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked,
the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the
chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a
chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and *arcane locked,* it takes four
uses of a *chime of opening* to get it open. A *silence* spell negates
the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of ten
times before it cracks and becomes useless.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *knock;* Price
3,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Circlet of Blasting, Minor
 On command, this simple golden headband
projects a blast of *searing light* (3d8 points of damage) once per day.

Faint evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *searing light;* Price
6,480 gp.

### Circlet of Blasting, Major
 On command, this elaborate golden
headband projects a blast of *searing light* (5d8 maximized for 40
points of damage) once per day.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell, *searing
light;* Price 23,760 gp.

### Circlet of Persuasion
 This silver headband grants a +3 competence
bonus on the wearer's Charisma-based checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *eagle's splendor;*
Price 4,500 gp.

### Cloak of Arachnida
 This black garment, embroidered with a weblike
pattern in silk, gives the wearer the ability to climb as if a *spider
climb* spell had been placed upon her. In addition, the cloak grants her
immunity to entrapment by *web* spells or webs of any sort---she can
actually move in webs at half her normal speed. Once per day, the wearer
of this cloak can cast *web*. She also gains a +2 luck bonus on all
Fortitude saves against poison from spiders.

Faint conjuration and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item,
*spider climb, web;* Price 14,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Cloak of the Bat
 Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, this cloak
bestows a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. The wearer is also able to
hang upside down from the ceiling, like a bat.

By holding the edges of the garment, the wearer is able to *fly* as per
the spell. If he desires, the wearer can actually polymorph himself into
an ordinary bat and fly accordingly. (All possessions worn or carried
are part of the transformation.) Flying, either with the cloak or in bat
form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky
or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground). Either of
the flying powers is usable for up to 7 minutes at a time, but after a
flight of any duration the cloak cannot bestow any flying power for a
like period of time.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *fly, polymorph;*
Price 26,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Cloak of Charisma
 This lightweight and fashionable cloak has a
highly decorative silver trim. When in a character's possession, it adds
a +2, +4, or +6 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, *eagle's splendor;*
Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6); Weight 2 lb.

### Cloak of Displacement, Minor
 This item appears to be a normal
cloak, but when worn by a character its magical properties distort and
warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the *displacement*
spell except that it only grants a 20% miss chance on attacks against
the wearer. It functions continually.

Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *displacement;* Price
24,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Cloak of Displacement, Major
 This item appears to be a normal
cloak, but on command its magical properties distort and warp light
waves. This displacement works just like the *displacement* spell and
lasts for a total of 15 rounds per day, which the wearer can divide up
as she sees fit.

Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Extend Spell,
*displacement;* Price 50,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Cloak of Elvenkind
 This cloak of neutral gray cloth is
indistinguishable from an ordinary cloak of the same color. However,
when worn with the hood drawn up around the head, it gives the wearer a
+5 competence bonus on Hide checks.

Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *invisibility,* creator
must be an elf; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Cloak of Etherealness
 This silvery-gray cloak seems to absorb light
rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer
ethereal (as the *ethereal jaunt* spell). The effect is dismissible. The
cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need
not be continuous.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, *ethereal jaunt;*
Price 55,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Cloak of the Manta Ray
 This cloak appears to be made of leather
until the wearer enters salt water. At that time the *cloak of the manta
ray* adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a
manta ray (as the *polymorph* spell, except that it allows only manta
ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability to breathe
underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray.

Although the cloak does not enable the wearer to bite opponents as a
manta ray does, it does have a tail spine that can be used to strike at
opponents behind the wearer, dealing 1d6 points of damage. This attack
can be used in addition to any other attack the character has, using his
highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release his arms from the
cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *polymorph*, *water
breathing;* Price 7,200 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Cloak of Resistance
 These garments offer magic protection in the
form of a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws (Fortitude,
Reflex, and Will).

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *resistance,* creator's
caster level must be at least three times the cloak's bonus; Price 1,000
gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp
(+5);Weight 1 lb.

### Crystal Ball
 This is the most common form of scrying device, a
crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. A character can use the
device to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of
existence, as with the spell *scrying* (Will DC 16 negates).

Certain *crystal balls* have additional powers that can be used through
the *crystal ball* on the target viewed.

additional spells put into item); Weight 7 lb.

### Cube of Force
 This device is about 3/4 inch across and can be made
of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. It enables its possessor to put up
a special *wall of force* 10 feet on a side around her person. This
cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack
forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges, which are
renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate
a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect
costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or
portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active,
the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the
table.

When the *cube of force* is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points
of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that
they deal. Spells that affect the integrity of the screenalso drain
extra charges. These spells (given in the list below) cannot be cast
into or out of the cube:

  ----------- ------------------------ --------------- -----------------------------
|Cube Face   Charge Cost per Minute   Maximum Speed||Effect|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1           1                        30 ft.       ||Keeps out gases, wind, etc.|

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *wall of force*; Price
62,000 gp.

### Cube of Frost Resistance
 This cube is activated or deactivated by
pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet
on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item
is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is
always at least 65°F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However,
if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1
round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses into its portable
form and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more
than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is
destroyed.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *protection from energy;*
Price 27,000 gp.

### Cubic Gate
 This item is fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six
sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which is the Material
Plane. The character creating the item should choose the planes to which
the other five sides are keyed.

If a side of the *cubic gate* is pressed once, it opens a *gate* to a
random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per
minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes
through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second
time closes the *gate*. It is impossible to open more than one *gate* at
a time.

If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing
is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all
creatures in adjacent squares. (The other creatures may avoid this fate
by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves).

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *plane shift;* Price
164,000 gp.

### Darkskull
 This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever
the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an *unhallow*
spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin
(except that no additional spell effect is tied or fixed to the
*darkskull*).

Moderate evocation \[evil\]; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *unhallow,*
creator must be evil; Price 60,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

### Decanter of Endless Water
 If the stopper is removed from this
ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or
salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type as well
as the volume and velocity.

-   "Stream" pours out 1 gallon per round.
-   "Fountain" produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.
-   "Geyser" produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons
    per round.

The geyser effect causes considerable back pressure, requiring the
holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down. The
force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage but can only affect one
target per round. The command word must be spoken to stop it.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *control water;*
Price 9,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.

### Deck of Illusions
 This set of parchment cards is usually found in
an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of thirty-four
cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a *major
image* of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The
illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card
landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it
obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion
is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the
card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly
dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are
summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to
simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards
or tarot cards.)

A randomly generated deck is usually complete (11--100 on d%), but may
be discovered (01--10) with 1d20 of its cards missing. If cards are
missing, reduce the price by a corresponding amount.

Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *major image;* Price 8,100
gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

### Dimensional Shackles
 These shackles have golden runes traced across
their cold iron surface. Any creature bound within them is affected as
if a *dimensional anchor* spell were cast upon her (no save). They fit
any Small to Large creature. The DC to break or slip out of the shackles
is 30.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *dimensional anchor;*
Price 28,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

### Drums of Panic
 These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about
1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are
unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all
creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a
20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a *fear*
spell (Will DC 16 partial). *Drums of panic* can be used once per day.

Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *fear;* Price 30,000
gp;Weight 10 lb. for the pair.

### Dust of Appearance
 This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very
light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the
air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if
they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of *blur* and
*displacement.* (In this, it works just like the *faerie fire* spell).
The dust also reveals figments, *mirror images*, and *projected images*
for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a --30 penalty
on its Hide checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes.

*Dust of appearance* is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow
bone tubes.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *glitterdust;* Price
1,800 gp.

### Dust of Disappearance
 This dust looks just like *dust of
appearance* and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or
object touched by it becomes invisible (as *greater invisibility*).
Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be
detected by magical means, including *see invisibility* or *invisibility
purge*. *Dust of appearance,* however, does reveal people and objects
made invisible by *dust of disappearance.* Other factors, such as sound
and smell, also allow possible detection.

The *greater invisibility* bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds.The
invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end.

Moderate illusion; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *greater invisibility;*
Price 3,500 gp.

### Dust of Dryness
 This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown
into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed
to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or
resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks
and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water
(fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.

If the dust is employed against an elemental with the water subtype, the
creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust
deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw
succeeds.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *control water;*
Price 850 gp.

### Dust of Illusion
 This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or
powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and
form. Put *dust of illusion* on a creature, and that creature is
affected as if by a *disguise self* glamer, with the individual who
sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target
is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2
hours.

Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *disguise self;* Price
1,200 gp.

### Dust of Tracelessness
 This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic
powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions.
Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to
100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and
cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.

A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage
of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back
into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no
magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival
checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have
a DC 20 higher than normal.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *pass without trace;*
Price 250 gp.

### Efficient Quiver
 This appears to be a typical arrow container
capable of holding about twenty arrows. It has three distinct portions,
each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than
would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to
sixty objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second
slightly longer compartment holds up to eighteen objects of the same
general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of
the case contains as many as six objects of the same general size and
shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled
it, the quiver can produce any item she wishes, as if from a regular
quiver or scabbard. The *efficientquiver* weighs the same no matter
what's placed inside it.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *secret chest;* Price
1,800 gp;Weight 2 lb.

### Efreeti Bottle
 This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze,
with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is
often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When
opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly.
There is a 10% chance (01--10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and
attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance
(91--100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three *wishes*. In
either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The other 80% of
the time (11--90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the
character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death),
doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's
effect.

Strong conjuration; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, *summon monster VII;*
Price 145,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Elemental Gem
 This gem contains a conjuration spell attuned to a
specific Elemental Plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).

When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large
elemental appears as if summoned by a *summon nature's ally* spell. The
elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.

The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons.
*Air elemental gems* are transparent, *earth elemental gems* are light
brown, *fire elemental gems* are reddish orange, and *water elemental
gems* are blue-green.

Moderate conjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *summon nature's
ally V;* Price 2,250 gp.

### Elixir of Fire Breath
 This strange elixir bestows upon the drinker
the ability to spit gouts of flame. He can breathe fire up to three
times, each time dealing 4d6 points of fire damage to a single target up
to 25 feet away. The victim can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half
damage. Unused blasts dissipate 1 hour after the liquid is consumed.

Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *scorching ray*; Price
1,100 gp.

### Elixir of Hiding
 A character drinking this liquid gains an
intuitive ability to hide (+10 competence bonus on Hide checks for 1
hour).

Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *invisibility;* Price 250
gp.

### Elixir of Love
 This sweet-tasting liquid causes the character
drinking it to become *charmed* with the first creature she sees after
consuming the draft (as *charm person*---the drinker must be a humanoid
of Medium or smaller size, Will DC 14 negates). The *charm* effects wear
off in 1d3 hours.

Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, *charm person;* Price
150 gp.

### Elixir of Sneaking
 This draught of liquid grants the drinker the
ability to walk softly and dampens sound around her slightly, granting a
+10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 hour.

Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *silence;* Price 250 gp.

### Elixir of Swimming
 This elixir bestows swimming ability. An almost
imperceptible magic sheath surrounds the drinker, allowing him to glide
through the water easily (+10 competence bonus on Swim checks for 1
hour).

Faint illusion; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have 5 ranks
in the Swim skill; Price 250 gp.

### Elixir of Truth
 This elixir forces the individual drinking it to
say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes (Will DC 13 negates).

She is compelled to answer any questions put to her in that time, but
with each question she is free to make a separate DC 13 Will save. If
one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn't break free of
the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn't have to answer that
particular question. No more than one question can be asked each round.
This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment.

Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *zone of truth;* Price
500 gp.

### Elixir of Vision
 Drinking this elixir grants the imbiber the
ability to notice acute details with great accuracy (+10 competence
bonus on Search checks for 1 hour).

Faint divination; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, *true seeing;* Price 250
gp.

### Eversmoking Bottle
 This metal urn is identical in appearance to an
*efreeti bottle,* except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of
smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and
totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the
bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per
round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains
smoke-filled until the *eversmoking bottle* is stoppered.

The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke
dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4
rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *pyrotechnics;* Price
5,400 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Eyes of Charming
 These two crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes.
The wearer is able to use *charm person* (one target per round) merely
by meeting a target's gaze. Those failing a DC 16 Will save are
*charmed* as per the spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of
the saving throw is reduced to 10.

Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Heighten Spell,
*charm person;* Price 56,000 gp for a pair.

### Eyes of Doom
 These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes,
enabling him to cast *doom* upon those around him (one target per round)
as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action,
and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a
DC 11 Will save are affected as by the *doom* spell. If the wearer has
only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10. However, if
the wearer has both lenses, he gains the additional power of a continual
*deathwatch* effect and can use *fear* (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal
gaze attack once per week.

Moderate necromancy; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *doom, deathwatch,
fear;* Price 25,000 gp.

### Eyes of the Eagle
 These items are made of special crystal and fit
over the eyes of the wearer. These lenses grant a +5 competence bonus on
Spot checks. Wearing only one of the pair causes a character to become
dizzy and, in effect, stunned for 1 round. Thereafter, the wearer can
use the single lens without being stunned so long as she covers her
other eye. Of course, she can remove the single lens and see normally at
any time, or wear both lenses to end or avoid the dizziness.

Faint divination; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item,
*clairaudience/clairvoyance;* Price 2,500 gp.

### Eyes of Petrification
 These items are made of special crystal and
fit over the eyes of the wearer. They allow her to use a petrification
gaze attack (Fortitude DC 19 negates) for 10 rounds per day. Both lenses
must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *flesh to stone;*
Price 98,000 gp.

### Figurines of Wondrous Power
 Each of the several kinds of *figurines
of wondrous power* appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an
inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down
and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of
normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and
serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands
Common but does not speak.

If a *figurine of wondrous power* is broken or destroyed in its
statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power
departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a
statuette that can be used again at a later time.

*Bronze Griffon:* When animated, a *bronze griffon* acts in all ways
like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can
be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have
passed or when the command word is spoken, the *bronze griffon* once
again becomes a tiny statuette.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate objects;*
Price 10,000 gp.

*Ebony Fly:* When animated, an *ebony fly* is the size of a pony and has
all the statistics of a hippogriff but can make no attacks. The item can
be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours
have passed or when the command word is spoken, the *ebony fly* again
becomes a tiny statuette.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate objects;*
Price 10,000 gp.

*Golden Lions:* These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult
male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from
statuette form for one full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per
day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command
word.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate objects;*
Price 16,500 gp.

*Ivory Goats:* These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio
looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different
function:

-   *The Goat of Traveling:* This statuette provides a speedy and
    enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except
    appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each
    week---continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24
    hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it
    returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it
    can again be used.
-   *The Goat of Travail:* This statuette becomes an enormous creature,
    larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for
    the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage
    1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use
    its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in
    that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to
    12 hours at a time.
-   *The Goat of Terror:* When called upon with the proper command word,
    this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, with the statistics of
    a light warhorse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as
    weapons (one horn as a *+3 heavy lance,* the other as a *+5
    longsword*). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the *goat
    of terror* radiates *fear* as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC
    16 partial). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours
    per use.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate objects;*
Price 21,000 gp.

*Marble Elephant:* This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette
being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command
word, a *marble elephant* grows to the size and specifications of a true
elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the
figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant.
The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a
time.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate objects;*
Price 17,000 gp.

*Obsidian Steed:* This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of
black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles
some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian
becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the
following additional powers usable once per round at will: *overland
flight, plane shift,* and *ethereal jaunt.* The steed allows itself to
be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10%
likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its
statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one
continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an *obsidian steed*
becomes ethereal or *plane shifts,* its rider and his gear follow suit.

Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.

Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item,
*animate objects, etherealness, fly, plane shift;* Price 28,500 gp.

*Onyx Dog:* When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with
the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an
Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional
olfactory and visual abilities. (It has the scent ability and adds +4 to
its Spot and Search checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can *see
invisibility.* An *onyx dog* can be used once per week for up to 6
hours. It obeys only its owner.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate objects;*
Price 15,500 gp.

*Serpentine Owl:* This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl
or a giant owl according to the command word used. The transformation
can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous
hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the
statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with
its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears.
(Remember the limitations of its Intelligence.)

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate objects;*
Price 9,100 gp.

*Silver Raven:* This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but
it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10).
Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a
creature affected by an *animal messenger* spell. If not commanded to
carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it
has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its
nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not
be continuous.

Faint enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item,
*animal messenger, animate objects;* Price 3,800 gp.

### Feather Token
 Each of these items is a small feather that has a
power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below.
Each token is usable once.

*Anchor:* A token useful to moor a craft in water so as to render it
immobile for up to one day.

*Bird:* A token that can be used to deliver a small written message
unerringly to a designated target as would a carrier pigeon. The token
lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.

*Fan:* A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of
sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not
cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to
lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter
winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used
for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.

*Swan Boat:* A token that forms a swanlike boat capable of moving on
water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear or
thirty-two Medium characters or any equivalent combination. The boat
lasts for one day.

*Tree:* A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot
diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an
instantaneous effect.

*Whip:* A token that forms into a huge leather whip and wields itself
against any opponent desired just like a dancing weapon. The weapon has
a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of damage, has a +1
enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a free grapple
attack (with a +15 attack bonus) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer
than 1 hour.

Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, *major creation;*
Price 50 gp (*anchor*), 300 gp (*bird*), 200 gp (*fan*), 450 gp (*swan
boat*), 400 gp (*tree*), 500 gp (*whip*).

### Gauntlets of Ogre Power
 These gauntlets are made of tough leather
with iron studs running across the back of the hands and fingers. They
grant the wearer great strength, adding a +2 enhancement bonus to his
Strength score. Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be
effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *bull's strength;*
Price 4,000 gp;Weight 4 lb.

### Gauntlet of Rust
 This single metal gauntlet looks rusted and pitted
but is actually quite powerful. Once per day, it can affect an object as
with the *rusting grasp* spell. It also completely protects the wearer
and her gear from rust (magical or otherwise), including the attack of a
rust monster.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *rusting grasp;*
Price 11,500 gp;Weight 2 lb.

### Gem of Brightness
 This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism.
Upon utterance of a command word, the crystal emits bright light of one
of three sorts.

-   One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern.
    This use of the gem does not expend any charges.
-   Another command word causes the *gem of brightness* to send out a
    bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a
    ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded
    for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of
    the gem expends 1 charge.
-   The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash
    of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a
    moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude
    save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.

A newly created *gem of brightness* has 50 charges. When all its charges
are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical.

Faint evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *daylight;* Price 13,000
gp.

### Gem of Seeing
 This finely cut and polished stone is
indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed
through, a *gem of seeing* enables the user to see as though she were
affected by the *true seeing* spell. A *gem of seeing* can be used for
as much as 30 minutes a day, divided up into periods of minutes or
rounds as the user sees fit.

Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *true seeing;* Price
75,000 gp.

### Gloves of Arrow Snaring
 Once snugly worn, these gloves seem to meld
with the hands, becoming almost invisible. Twice per day, the wearer can
act as if he had the Snatch Arrows feat, even if he does not meet the
prerequisites for it. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be
effective. At least one hand must be free to take advantage of the
magic.

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *shield;* Price 4,000 gp.

### Gloves of Dexterity
 These thin leather gloves are very flexible and
allow for delicate manipulation. They add to the wearer's Dexterity
score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6. Both gloves
must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, *cat's grace;*
Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).

### Glove of Storing
 This device is a simple leather glove. On command,
one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can
weigh no more than 20 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand.
While stored, the item has negligible weight. With a snap of the fingers
wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove can only store one item
at a time. Storing or retrieving the item is a free action. The item is
held in stasis and shrunk down so small within the palm of the glove
that it cannot be seen. Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue
to expire. If an effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item
appears instantly.

Faint transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *shrink item;* Price
10,000 gp (one glove).

### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing
 These apparently normal lightweight
gloves grant a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks and Climb checks. Both
gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *bull's strength,
cat's grace;* Price 6,250 gp.

### Goggles of Minute Seeing
 The lenses of this item are made of
special crystal. When placed over the eyes of the wearer, the lenses
enable her to see much better than normal at distances of 1 foot or
less, granting her a +5 competence bonus on Search checks to find secret
doors, traps, and similar concealed objects. Both lenses must be worn
for the magic to be effective.

Faint divination; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *true seeing;* Price
1,250 gp.

### Goggles of Night
 The lenses of this item are made of dark crystal.
Even though the lenses are opaque, when placed over the eyes of the
wearer they enable him to see normally and also grant him 60-foot
darkvision. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *darkvision;* Price
12,000 gp.

### Golem Manual
 A *golem manual* contains information, incantations
and magical power that help a character to craft a golem. The
instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to
craft the golem's body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells
needed for a specific golem, effectively grants the builder use of the
Craft Construct feat during the construction of the golem, and grants
the character an increase to her caster level for the purpose of
crafting a golem. Any golem built using a *golem manual* does not cost
the creator any XP, since the requisite XP are "contained" in the book
and "expended" by the book during the creation process.

The spells included in a *golem manual* require a spell trigger
activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a
golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing
the golem's body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual
fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book's ashes are
sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.

*Clay Golem Manual:* The book contains *animate objects, bless, commune,
prayer*, and *resurrection*. The reader may treat her caster level as
two levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a clay golem.
The book supplies 1,540 XP for the creation of a clay golem.

Moderate conjuration, divination, enchantment, and transmutation; CL
11th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 11th, *animate
objects, commune, prayer, resurrection*; Price 12,000 gp; Cost 2,150
gp + 1,712 XP; Weight 5 lb.

*Flesh Golem Manual:* The book contains *animate dead, bull's strength,
geas/quest,* and *limited wish*. The reader may treat her caster level
as one level higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a flesh
golem. The book supplies 780 XP for the creation of a flesh golem.

Moderate enchantment, necromancy \[evil\], and transmutation; CL 8th;
Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 8th, *animate dead, bull's
strength, geas/quest, limited wish*; Price 8,000 gp; Cost 2,050 gp + 944
XP; Weight 5 lb.

*Iron Golem Manual:* The book contains *cloudkill, geas/quest, limited
wish*, and *polymorph any object*. The reader may treat her caster level
as four levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a iron
golem. The book supplies 5,600 XP for the creation of a iron golem.

Strong conjuration, enchantment and transmutation; CL 16th; Craft
Construct, creator must be caster level 16th, *cloudkill, geas/quest,
limited wish, polymorph any object*; Price 35,000 gp; Cost 3,500 gp +
5,880 XP; Weight 5 lb.

*Stone Golem Manual:* The book contains *geas/quest, limited wish,
polymorph any object*, and *slow*. The reader may treat her caster level
as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone
golem. The book supplies 3,400 XP for the creation of a stone golem.

Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 14th; Craft Construct, creator
must be caster level 14th, *antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of
stunning*; Price 22,000 gp; Cost 2,500 gp + 3,600 XP; Weight 5 lb.

*Stone Golem Manual, Greater:* The book contains *geas/quest, limited
wish, polymorph any object*, and *slow*. The reader may treat her caster
level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a
stone golem. The book supplies 7,640 XP for the creation of a greater
stone golem.

Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 16th; Craft Construct, creator
must be caster level 16th, *antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of
stunning*; Price 44,000 gp; Cost 2,900 gp + 7,872 XP; Weight 5 lb.

### Hand of Glory
 This mummified human hand hangs by a leather cord
around a character's neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would).
If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer
benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count
against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time.
Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use *daylight*
and *see invisibility* each once per day.

Faint varied; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate dead*, *daylight,
detect invisibility;* Price 8,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.

### Hand of the Mage
 This mummified elf hand hangs by a golden chain
around a character's neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would).
It allows the wearer to utilize the spell *mage hand* at will.

Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, *mage hand;* Price 900
gp;Weight 2 lb.

### Handy Haversack
 A backpack of this sort appears to be well made,
well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned
leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side
pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of
material. In fact, each is like a *bag of holding* and can actually hold
material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight.
The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or
80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs
only 5 pounds.

While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power
in addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that
item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever
necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific
item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the
attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *secret chest;* Price
2,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

### Harp of Charming
 This instrument is a golden, intricately carved
harp. When played, it enables the performer to work one *suggestion* (as
the spell, Will DC 14 negates) into the music for each 10 minutes of
playing if he can succeed on a DC 14 Perform (string instruments) check.
If the check fails, the audience cannot be affected by any further
performances from the harpist for 24 hours.

Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *suggestion;* Price
7,500 gp;Weight 5 lb.

### Hat of Disguise
 This apparently normal hat allows its wearer to
alter her appearance as with a *disguise self* spell. As part of the
disguise, the hat can be changed to appear as a comb, ribbon, headband,
cap, coif, hood, helmet, and so on.

Faint illusion; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, *disguise self;* Price
1,800 gp.

### Headband of Intellect
 This device is a light cord with a small gem
set so that it rests upon the forehead of the wearer. The headband adds
to the wearer's Intelligence score in the form of an enhancement bonus
of +2, +4, or +6. This enhancement bonus does not earn the wearer extra
skill points when a new level is attained; use the unenhanced
Intelligence bonus to determine skill points.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, *fox's cunning;*
Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).

### Helm of Brilliance
 This normal-looking helm takes its true form and
manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word.
Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set
with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals,
and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and
sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crownlike,
gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:

-   Diamond: *Prismatic spray* (save DC 20)
-   Ruby: *Wall of fire*
-   Fire opal: *Fireball* (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )
-   Opal: *Daylight*

The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its
spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a *helm
of brilliance* also has the following magical properties when activated.

-   It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This
    light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures
    within that range.
-   The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming
    weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may
    already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The
    command takes 1 round to take effect.
-   The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection does not
    stack with similar protection from other sources.

Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and
the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.

If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the
fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15
Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate.
Remaining diamonds become *prismatic sprays* that each randomly target a
creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line
*walls of fire* extending outward in a random direction from the helm
wearer, and fire opals become *fireballs* centered on the helm wearer.
The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.

Strong varied; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *detect undead, fireball,
flame blade, light, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of
fire;* Price 125,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Helm of Comprehend Languages and Read Magic
 Appearing as a normal
helmet, a *helm of comprehend languages and read magic* grants its
wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to
read text in any language and any magical writing. The wearer gains a +5
competence bonus on Decipher Script checks to understand messages
written in incomplete, archaic, or exotic forms. Note that understanding
a magical text does not necessarily imply spell use.

Faint divination; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, *comprehend languages,
read magic;* Price 5,200 gp; Weight 3 lb.

### Helm of Telepathy
 The wearer can use *detect thoughts* at will.
Furthermore, he can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface
thoughts he is reading (allowing two-way communication). Once per day,
the wearer of the helm can implant a *suggestion* (as the spell, Will DC
14 negates) along with his telepathic message.

Faint divination and enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *detect
thoughts, suggestion;* Price 27,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Helm of Teleportation
 A character wearing this device may
*teleport* three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of
the same name.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *teleport;* Price
73,500 gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Helm of Underwater Action
 The wearer of this helmet can see
underwater. Drawing the small lenses in compartments on either side into
position before the wearer's eyes activates the visual properties of the
helm, allowing her to see five times farther than water and light
conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds, obstructions,
and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is
spoken, the *helm of underwater action* creates a globe of air around
the wearer's head and maintains it until the command word is spoken
again, enabling her to breathe freely.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *water breathing;*
Price 57,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Horn of Blasting
 This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can
be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the
instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to
creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened for 2d6
rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates
the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take 7d6 points of
sonic damage, with no save unless they're held, worn, or carried by
creatures (Will DC 16 negates).

If a *horn of blasting* is used magically more than once in a given day,
there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes
and deals 10d6 points of damage to the person sounding it.

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *shout;* Price 20,000
gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Horn of Blasting, Greater
 This horn functions as a *horn of
blasting,* except that it deals 10d6 points of sonic damage, stuns
creatures for 1 round, and deafens them for 4d6 rounds (a DC 19
Fortitude reduces the damage by half and negates the stunning and
deafening). Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as
described for the *horn of blasting.* A *greater horn of blasting* also
has a 20% cumulative chance of exploding.

Strong evocation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, *greater shout;* Price
70,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Horn of Fog
 This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a
thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an *obscuring mist* spell.
The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that
the user continues to blow the horn; fog clouds travel 10 feet each
round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by
something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep,
foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register
at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate
wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph)
disperses the fog in 1 round.

Faint conjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *obscuring mist;* Price
2,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Horn of Goodness/Evil
 This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so
it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner's
alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power
whatsoever. If he is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a
*magic circle against evil*. If he is evil, then blowing the horn has
the effect of a *magic circle against good*. In either case, this ward
lasts for 1 hour. The horn can be blown once per day.

Faint abjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *magic circle against
good, magic circle against evil;* Price 6,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Horn of the Tritons
 This device is a conch shell that can be blown
once per day except by a triton which can sound it three times per day.
A *horn of the tritons* can perform any one of the following functions
when blown.

-   Calm rough waters in a 1-mile radius. This effect dispels a summoned
    water elemental if it fails a DC 16 Will save.
-   Attract 5d4 Large sharks (01--30 on d%), 5d6 Medium sharks (31--80),
    or 1d10 sea lions (81--100) if the character is in a body of water
    in which such creatures dwell. The creatures are friendly and obey,
    to the best of their ability, the one who sounded the horn.
-   Causes aquatic creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 within
    500 feet to become panicked as if they had been targeted by a *fear*
    spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who successfully save are shaken
    for 3d6 rounds.

Any sounding of a *horn of the tritons* can be heard by all tritons
within a 3-mile radius.

Moderate conjuration and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item,
*fear, summon monster V, control water,* creator must be a triton or get
construction aid from a triton; Price 15,100 gp; Weight 2 lb.

### Horn of Valhalla
 This magic instrument comes in four varieties.
Each appears to be normal until someone speaks its command word and
blows the horn. Then the horn summons a number of human barbarians to
fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just
once every seven days. Roll d% and refer to the table below to see what
type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are
summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character
who uses a *horn of Valhalla* but doesn't have the prerequisite is
attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.

  --------- -------------- --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------
|d%        Type of Horn   Barbarians Summoned||Prerequisite|
| --- | --- | --- |
|01--40    Silver         2d4+2, 2nd level   ||None|
| --- | --- | --- |
|41--75    Brass          2d4+1, 3rd level   ||Spellcaster level 1st|
| --- | --- | --- |
|76--90    Bronze         2d4, 4th level     ||Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic music ability|
| --- | --- | --- |
|91--100   Iron           1d4+1, 5th level   ||Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic music ability|
| --- | --- | --- |
  --------- -------------- --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------

Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem
to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They
attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until
they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever
comes first.

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *summon monster VI;*
Price 50,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.

### Horseshoes of Speed
 These iron shoes come in sets of four like
ordinary horseshoes. When affixed to an animal's hooves, they increase
the animal's base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement
bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances
increase proportionally. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal
for the magic to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *haste;* Price 3,000
gp;Weight 12 lb. (for four).

### Horseshoes of a Zephyr
 These four iron shoes are affixed like
normal horseshoes. They allow a horse to travel without actually
touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4
inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that nonsolid or
unstable surfaces can be crossed, and that movement is possible without
leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base
land speed. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic
to be effective.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *levitate;* Price
6,000 gp;Weight 4 lb. (for four).

### Incense of Meditation
 This small rectangular block of sweet
smelling incense is visually indistinguishable from nonmagical incense
until lit. When it is burning, the special fragrance and pearly-hued
smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15
Spellcraft check.

When a divine spellcaster lights a block of *incense of meditation* and
then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables
him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell
feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal
level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).

Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24
hours.

Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell,
*bless;* Price 4,900 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Instant Fortress
 This metal cube is small, but when activated by
speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30
feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement
atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to
the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a
small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the
fortress---even *knock* spells can't open the door.

The adamantine walls of *instant fortress* have 100 hit points and
hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a *wish* or a
*miracle*, which restores 50 points of damage taken.

The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the
device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command.
People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be
caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10
points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).

The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from
the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is
empty.

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *mage's magnificent
mansion;* Price 55,000 gp.

### Ioun Stones
 These crystalline stones always float in the air and
must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character
first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon
it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone
must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may
voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is
sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during
that time. *Ioun stones* have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

Regeneration from the pearly white *ioun stone* works like a *ring of
regeneration.* (It only cures damage taken while the character is using
the stone.) The pale lavender and lavender and green stones work like a
*rod of absorption,* but absorbing a spell requires a readied action,
and these stones cannot be used to empower spells. Stored spells in the
vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by
anyone (see *ring of minor spell storing*).

level.

### Iron Bands of Binding
 When initially discovered, this very potent
item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on
the globe.

When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is
hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the
target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or
smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile until the
command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The
creature can break (and ruin) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or
escape them with a DC 30 Escape Artist check. *Iron bands of binding*
are usable once per day.

Strong evocation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *grasping hand;* Price

### Iron Flask
 These special containers are typically inlaid with runes
of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with
sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command
word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container,
provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect
is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the
stopper frees the captured creature.

The command word can be given only once per day.

If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word,
the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the
command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations.
(It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.)
Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time
provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly
discovered bottle might contain any of the following:

with a handle.

### Lyre of Building
 If the proper chords are struck, a single use of
this lyre negates any attacks made against all inanimate construction
(walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the
effects of a *horn of blasting,* a *disintegrate* spell, or an attack
from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way
once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.

The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week its
strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct
buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, or whatever. The effect produced in
but 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring
for three days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre
must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she
must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week
has passed.

### Marvelous Pigments
 These magic emulsions enable their possessor to
create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two
dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles,
hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the
desired object as the artist concentrates on the desired image. One pot
of *marvelous pigments* is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot
object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.

Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be
created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes
and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the
pigments. *Marvelous pigments* cannot create magic items. Objects of
value depicted by the pigments ---precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory,
and so on--- appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead,
paste, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can
create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including
foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp.

Items created are not magical; the effect is instantaneous.

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, *major creation;*
Price 4,000 gp.

### Mask of the Skull
 This ivory mask has been fashioned into the
likeness of a human skull. Once per day, after it has been worn for at
least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It
travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned
to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target
based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the
target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be struck dead, as if
affected by a *finger of death* spell. If the target succeeds on his
saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After
attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user.
The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.

Strong necromancy and transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item,
*animate objects, finger of death, fly;* Price 22,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.

### Mattock of the Titans
 This digging tool is 10 feet long. Any
creature of at least Huge size can use it to loosen or tumble earth or
earthen ramparts (a 10-foot cube every 10 minutes). It also smashes rock
(a 10-foot cube per hour). If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of
a Gargantuan *+3 adamantine warhammer,* dealing 4d6 points of base
damage.

Strong transmutation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, *move earth;* Price 23,348 gp; Cost 13,348 gp + 800 XP; Weight

### Maul of the Titans
 This mallet is 8 feet long. If used as a weapon,
it is the equivalent of a *+3 greatclub* and deals triple damage against
inanimate objects. However, the wielder must have a Strength of at least
18 to wield it properly. Otherwise, she takes a --4 penalty on attack
rolls.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, *clenched fist;* Price 25,305 gp; Cost 12,305 gp + 480 XP; Weight

### Medallion of Thoughts
 This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung
from a neck chain. Usually fashioned from bronze, copper, or
nickel-silver, the medallion allows the wearer to read the thoughts of
others, as with the spell *detect thoughts.*

Faint divination; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *detect thoughts;* Price
12,000 gp.

### Mirror of Life Trapping
 This crystal device is usually about 4 feet
square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a
surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command
word deactivates the mirror. A *mirror of life trapping* has fifteen
nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming
within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make
a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A
creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own
reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and
thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is
aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat
as a gaze attack).

When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is
not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are
inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment
(including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the
mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection
of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless
prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped
creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.

If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly)
is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is
broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.

Strong abjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, *imprisonment;* Price
200,000 gp;Weight 50 lb.

### Mirror of Mental Prowess
 This mirror resembles an ordinary looking
glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. The possessor who knows the proper
commands can cause it to perform as follows.

-   Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the
    owner is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in
    an unknown language.
-   View other places as if with *clairvoyance,* but vision extends even
    onto other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.
-   Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the
    place with the *clairvoyance* function, then steps through the
    mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the
    mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side
    where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she
    returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24
    hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the
    user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with
    Intelligence of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they
    might notice a magical sensor from a *scrying* spell. Any creature
    who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.
-   Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question
    regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving
    answers similar to those from the *legend lore* spell).

Strong conjuration and divination; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, *detect
thoughts*, *clairaudience/clairvoyance, gate, legend lore*; Price
175,000 gp; Weight 40 lb.

### Mirror of Opposition
 This item resembles a normal mirror about 4
feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and
then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word
deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the
mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being.
This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all
the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the
defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the
duplicate and her items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to
four times per day.

Strong necromancy; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, *clone;* Price 92,000
gp;Weight 45 lb.

### Necklace of Adaptation
 This necklace is a heavy chain with a
platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a
shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases
(such as *cloudkill* and *stinking cloud* effects, as well as inhaled
poisons) and allowing him to breathe, even underwater or in a vacuum.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *alter self;* Price
9,000 gp.

### Necklace of Fireballs
 This device appears to be nothing but beads
on a string, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace.
(It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of
determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a
character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is---a
golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are
detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl
one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its
trajectory, it detonates as a *fireball* spell (Reflex DC 14 half ).

Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6
points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a
sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.

Each *necklace of fireballs* contains a combination of spheres of
various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I
through VII, are detailed below.

  ---------- ------ ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- --------------
|Necklace   10d6   9d6   8d6   7d6   6d6   5d6   4d6   3d6   2d6||Market Price|

  ---------- ------ ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- --------------

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her
saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving
throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save,
all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with
regrettable consequences for the wearer.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *fireball.*

### Orb of Storms
 This glass sphere is 8 inches in diameter. The
possessor can call forth all manner of weather, even supernaturally
destructive storms. Once per day she can call upon the orb to use a
*control weather* spell, Once per month, she can conjure a *storm of
vengeance*. The possessor of the orb is continually protected by an
*endure elements* effect.

Strong varied; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, *control weather, endure
elements, storm of vengeance;* Price 48,000 gp;Weight 6 lb.

### Pearl of Power
 This seemingly normal pearl of average size and
luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics,
druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a
*pearl of power* enables the possessor to recall any one spell that she
had prepared and then cast. The spell is then prepared again, just as if
it had not been cast. The spell must be of a particular level, depending
on the pearl. Different pearls exist for recalling one spell per day of
each level from 1st through 9th and for the recall of two spells per day
(each of a different level, 6th or lower).

Strong transmutation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be able
to cast spells of the spell level to be recalled; Price 1,000 gp (1st),
4,000 gp (2nd), 9,000 gp (3rd), 16,000 gp (4th), 25,000 gp (5th), 36,000
gp (6th), 49,000 gp (7th), 64,000 gp (8th), 81,000 gp (9th), or 70,000
gp (two spells).

### Pearl of the Sirines
 This normal-seeming pearl is beautiful and
worth at least 1,000 gp on that basis alone. If it is clasped firmly in
hand or held to the breast while the possessor attempts actions related
to the pearl's powers, she understands and is able to employ the item.

The pearl enables its possessor to breathe in water as if she were in
clean, fresh air. Her swim speed is 60 feet, and she can cast spells and
act underwater without hindrance.

Moderate abjuration and transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item,
*freedom of movement, water breathing;* Price 15,300 gp.

### Periapt of Health
 The wearer of this blue gem on a silver chain is
immune to disease, including supernatural diseases.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *remove disease;* Price
7,500 gp.

### Periapt of Proof against Poison
 This item is a brilliant-cut black
gem on a delicate silver chain. The wearer is immune to poison, although
poisons still active when the periapt is first donned still run their
course.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *neutralize poison;*
Price 27,000 gp.

### Periapt of Wisdom
 Although it appears to be a normal pearl on a
light chain, a *periapt of wisdom* actually increases the possessor's
Wisdom score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6
(depending on the individual item).

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, *owl's wisdom;*
Price 4,000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), 36,000 gp (+6).

### Periapt of Wound Closure
 This stone is bright red and dangles on a
gold chain. The wearer of this periapt automatically becomes stable if
his hit points drop to between --1 and --9 inclusive. The periapt
doubles the wearer's normal rate of healing or allows normal healing of
wounds that would not do so normally. Hit point damage that involves
bleeding is negated for the wearer of the periapt, but he is still
susceptible to damage from bleeding that causes Constitution loss, such
as that dealt by a wounding weapon.

Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *heal;* Price 15,000
gp.

### Phylactery of Faithfulness
 This item is a small box containing
religious scripture affixed to a leather cord and tied around the
forehead. There is no mundane way to determine what function this
religious item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a *phylactery of
faithfulness* is aware of any action or item that could adversely affect
his alignment and his standing with his deity, including magical
effects. He acquires this information prior to performing such an action
or becoming associated with such an item if he takes a moment to
contemplate the act.

Faint divination; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, *detect chaos, detect
evil, detect good, detect law;* Price 1,000 gp.

### Phylactery of Undead Turning
 This item is a boon to any character
able to turn undead, allowing him to do so as if his class level were
four levels higher than it actually is.

Moderate necromancy \[good\]; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, 10th-level
cleric; Price 11,000 gp.

### Pipes of Haunting
 This magic item appears to be a small set of pan
pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind
instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those
within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or
become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are
unaffected. *Pipes of haunting* can be sounded twice a day.

Faint necromancy; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, *scare;* Price 6,000
gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Pipes of Pain
 These appear to be like any other standard set of
pipes with nothing to reveal their true nature. When played by someone
who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes
create a wondrous melody. All within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Will save
or be fascinated by the sound. (This is a mind-affecting sonic
compulsion.)

As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense
pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally
silent area, she takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 2d4 rounds.
During this time, damage from sonic attacks is doubled. Thereafter, the
least noise causes an affected character to become shaken (except when
she is in a totally silent area). This hypersensitivity is a curse and
therefore hard to remove (see the *bestow curse* spell).

Faint enchantment and evocation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator
must have the bardic music class feature, *sound burst;* Price 12,000
gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Pipes of the Sewers
 These wooden pipes appear ordinary, but if the
possessor learns the proper tune, he can attract 1d3 rat swarms if rats
are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel,
there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats
appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind
instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic
commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they
turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats
leave immediately. If they are called again within a day, the Perform
check DC is 15.

If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the
controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another
check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is
actively seeking to reassert its control.

Faint conjuration; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, *charm animal, summon
nature's ally I,* wild empathy ability; Price 1,150 gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Pipes of Sounding
 When played by a character who has the Perform
(wind instruments) skill, these pipes create a variety of sounds. The
figment sounds are the equivalent of *ghost sound* (caster level 2nd).

Faint illusion; CL 2nd; Craft Wondrous Item, *ghost sound;* Price 1,800
gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Portable Hole
 A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the
webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of
starlight. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but
it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread
upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to
come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply
taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the
entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains.

The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened.
It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small
creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if
its hole is filled. Each *portable hole* opens on its own particular
nondimensional space. If a *bag of holding* is placed within a *portable
hole*, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag
and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a *portable
hole* is placed within a *bag of holding,* it opens a gate to the Astral
Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are
drawn there, the *portable hole* and *bag of holding* being destroyed in
the process.

Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, *plane shift;* Price
20,000 gp.

### Restorative Ointment
 A jar of this unguent is 3 inches in diameter
and 1 inch deep and contains five applications. Placed upon a poisoned
wound or swallowed, the ointment detoxifies any poison (as *neutralize
poison*). Applied to a diseased area, it removes disease (as *remove
disease*). Rubbed on a wound, the ointment cures 1d8+5 points of damage
(as *cure light wounds*).

Faint conjuration; CL 5th;Craft Wondrous Item, *cure light wounds,
neutralize poison, remove disease;* Price 4,000 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

### Ring Gates
 These always come in pairs---two iron rings, each about
18 inches in diameter. The rings must be on the same plane of existence
and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever is put through
one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of material can be
transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through and then
retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for instantaneous
transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A character can reach
through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon
through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head
through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a
*ring gate.* A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to
slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass
through easily. Each ring has a "entry side" and an "exit side," both
marked with appropriate symbols.

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, *gate;* Price 40,000
gp;Weight 1 lb. each.

### Robe of the Archmagi
 This normal-appearing garment can be white
(01--45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46--75, neither good nor evil
alignment), or black (76--100, evil alignment). Its wearer, if an arcane
spellcaster, gains the following powers.

-   +5 armor bonus to AC.
-   Spell resistance 18.
-   +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
-   +2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell
    resistance.

If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains
three negative levels. The reverse is true with respect to a black robe
donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray
robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe,
gains two negative levels. While these negative levels never result in
lost levels, they remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be
overcome in any way (including *restoration* spells).

Strong varied; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, *antimagic field, mage
armor* or *shield of faith,* creator must be of same alignment as robe;
Price 75,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Robe of Blending
 When this robe is put on, the wearer intuitively
knows that the garment has very special properties. A *robe of blending*
enables its wearer to appear to be part of his surroundings. This allows
him a +10 competence bonus on Hide checks. The wearer can adopt the
appearance of another creature, as with the *disguise self* spell, at
will. All creatures acquainted with and friendly to the wearer see him
normally.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *disguise self;* Price
30,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Robe of Bones
 This handy item functions much like a *robe of useful
items* for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable
robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small
embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of
the robe can see the embroidery and recognize them for the creatures
they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round.
Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see
the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the
wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned,
or destroyed. A newly created *robe of bones* always has two embroidered
figures of each of the following undead:

-   Small goblin skeleton
-   Medium human commoner skeleton
-   Medium wolf skeleton
-   Small goblin zombie
-   Medium human commoner zombie
-   Medium wolf zombie

Moderate necromancy \[evil\]; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate
dead*; Price 2,400 gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Robe of Eyes
 This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe
until it is put on. Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the
same moment due to scores of visible, magical eyelike patterns that
adorn the robe. She also gains 120-foot darkvision.

The *robe of eyes* sees all forms of invisible or ethereal things within
120 feet.

The wearer of a *robe of eyes* gains a +10 competence bonus on Search
checks and Spot checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when
flat-footed, and she can't be flanked. However, she is not able to avert
her eyes or close her eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze
attack.

A *light* or *continual flame* spell cast directly on a *robe of eyes*
causes it to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A *daylight* spell blinds it
for 2d4 minutes.

Moderate divination; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *true seeing;* Price
120,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Robe of Scintillating Colors
 The wearer of this robe can cause the
garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after
color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling
rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the wearer,
conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full
round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start
flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack
with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1
rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.

Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer
better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts
at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total
concealment).

The robe illuminates a 30-foot radius continuously.

The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.

Moderate illusion; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, *blur, rainbow
pattern;* Price 27,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Robe of Stars
 This garment is typically black or dark blue and
embroidered with small white or silver stars. The robe has three magical
powers.

-   It enables its wearer to travel physically to the Astral Plane,
    along with all that she is wearing or carrying.
-   It gives its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws.
-   Its wearer can use up to six of the embroidered stars on the chest
    portion of the robe as *+5 shuriken.* The robe grants its wearer
    proficiency with such weapons. Each shuriken disappears after it is
    used.

Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, *magic missile, astral
projection* or *plane shift;* Price 58,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

### Robe of Useful Items
 This appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a
character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small cloth patches
of various shapes. Only the wearer of the robe can see these patches,
recognize them for what items they become, and detach them. One patch
can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an
actual item, as indicated below. A newly created *robe of useful items*
always has two each of the following patches:

-   Dagger
-   Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
-   Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror)
-   Pole (10-foot length)
-   Hempen rope (50-foot coil)
-   Sack

In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number
of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below to
determine its nature.

  --------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|d%     ||Result|
| --- | --- | --- |
|01--08 ||Bag of 100 gold pieces|
| --- | --- | --- |
|09--15 ||Coffer, silver (6 in. by 6 in. by 1 ft.), 500 gp value|
| --- | --- | --- |
|16--22 ||Door, iron (up to 10 ft. wide and 10 ft. high and barred on one side---must be placed upright, attaches and hinges itself)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|23--30 ||Gems, 10 (100 gp value each)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|31--44 ||Ladder, wooden (24 ft. long)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|45--51 ||Mule (with saddle bags)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|52--59 ||Pit, open (10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|60--68 ||Potion of cure serious wounds|
| --- | --- | --- |
|69--75 ||Rowboat (12 ft. long)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|76--83 ||Minor scroll of one randomly determined spell|
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |

Multiple items of the same kind are permissible. Once removed, a patch
cannot be replaced.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, *fabricate;* Price
7,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Rope of Climbing
 A 60-foot-long *rope of climbing* is no thicker
than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon
command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other
direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever its
owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.

A *rope of climbing* can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This
causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope.
Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are
untied but lowers the DC of Climb checks while using it by 10. A
creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate rope;* Price
3,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

### Rope of Entanglement
 A *rope of entanglement* looks just like any
other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes
forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled
creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape
Artist check.

The rope has AC 22, 12 hit points, and hardness 10, and it has damage
reduction 5/slashing as well. The rope repairs damage to itself at a
rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a *rope of entanglement* is
severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.

Moderate transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, *animate objects,
animate rope, entangle;* Price 21,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.

### Salve of Slipperiness
 This substance provides a +20 competence
bonus on all Escape Artist checks, meaning that it is almost impossible
to grapple such a character or to tie or chain him up. In addition, such
obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed
individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If
it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a
long-lasting *grease* spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off
normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).

*Salve of slipperiness* is needed to coat the inside of a container that
is meant to hold *sovereign glue* (see below).

Faint conjuration; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, *grease;* Price 1,000
gp.

### Scabbard of Keen Edges
 This scabbard is fashioned from cured
leather and fine silver. It can shrink or enlarge to accommodate any
knife, dagger, sword, or similar weapon up to and including a
greatsword. Up to three times per day on command, the scabbard casts
*keen edge* on any blade placed within it.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *keen edge;* Price
16,000 gp;Weight 1 lb.

### Scarab of Protection
 This device appears to be a silver medallion
in the shape of a beetle. If it is held for 1 round, an inscription
appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective
device.

The scarab's possessor gains spell resistance 20. The scarab can also
absorb energy-draining attacks, death effects, and negative energy
effects. Upon absorbing twelve such attacks, the scarab turns to powder
and is destroyed.

Strong abjuration and necromancy; CL 18th; Craft Wondrous Item, *death
ward, spell resistance;* Price 38,000 gp.

### Scarab, Golembane
 This beetle-shaped pin enables its wearer to
detect any golem within 60 feet, although he must concentrate (a
standard action) in order for the detection to take place. A scarab
enables its possessor to combat golems with weapons, unarmed attacks, or
natural weapons as if those golems had no damage reduction.

Moderate divination; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, *detect magic,*
creator must be at least 10th level; Price 2,500 gp.

### Shrouds of Disintegration
 These burial wrappings look to be made of
fine, embroidered materials. When a body is placed inside, a command
word will turn it to dust. The magic of the shrouds is usable only once,
after which the wrappings become ordinary, fine cloth.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, *disintegrate*;
Price 6,600 gp; Weight 10 lb.

### Silversheen
 This substance can be applied to a weapon as a standard
action. It will give the weapon the properties of alchemical silver for
1 hour, replacing the properties of any other special material it might
have. One vial will coat a single melee weapon or 20 units of
ammunition.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item; Price 250 gp.

### Slippers of Spider Climbing
 When worn, a pair of these slippers
enable movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings,
leaving the wearer's hands free. Her speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery
surfaces---icy, oiled, or greased surfaces--- make these slippers
useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as
the wearer chooses.

Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, *spider climb;* Price
4,800 gp;Weight 1/2 lb.

### Sovereign Glue
 This pale amber substance is thick and viscous.
Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask
whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of *salve of slipperiness*,
and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new
application of the *salve of slipperiness* must be put in the flask
within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side
of the container. A flask of *sovereign glue,* when found, holds
anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8--1, minimum 1), with the
other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the *salve of
slipperiness.* One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of
surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent
union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a
move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue
loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set,
then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except
when *universal solvent* is applied to the bond. (*Sovereign glue* is
dissolved by *universal solvent.*)

Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, *make whole;* Price
2,400 gp (per ounce).

### Stone of Alarm
 This stone cube, when given the command word,
affixes itself to any object. If that object is touched thereafter by
anyone who does not first speak that same command word, the stone emits
a piercing screech for 1 hour that can be heard up to a quarter-mile
away (assuming no intervening barriers).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, *alarm;* Price 2,700
gp;Weight 2 lb.

### Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals
 A stone of this nature is
typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock.

The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning,
and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summoner. The summoning words
require 1 full round to speak, and in all ways the stone functions as
the *summon monster VII* spell. (If sand or rough, unhewn stone is the
summoning medium, the elemental that comes is Large instead, and the
stone functions as the *summon monster VI* spell.) The elemental appears
in 1d4 rounds. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new
elemental requires a new patch of earth or stone, which cannot be
accessed until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled,
dismissed, or slain).

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *summon monster VI,
summon monster VII;* Price 100,000 gp;Weight 5 lb.

### Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)
 This stone is typically a bit of
rough polished agate or some similar mineral. Its possessor gains a +1
luck bonus on saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *divine favor;* Price
20,000 gp.

### Stone Horse
 Each item of this nature appears to be a fullsized,
roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A
command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and
even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind.

A *stone horse* can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to
rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first using a *stone
to flesh* spell, thus causing the *stone horse* to become a normal horse
that can be healed normally. When fully healed, it automatically reverts
to its stone form. While in its stone form, it can be fed gems, healing
1 point of damage for each 50 gp worth of mineral it is given.

There are two sorts of *stone horses.*

*Courser:* This item has the statistics of a heavy horse as well as
having hardness 10.

*Destrier:* This item has the statistics of a heavy warhorse as well as
having hardness 10.

Strong transmutation; CL 14th; Craft Wondrous Item, *flesh to stone,
animate objects;* Price 10,000 gp (*courser*) or 14,800 gp
(*destrier*);Weight 6,000 lb.

### Stone Salve
 This ointment has two uses. If an ounce of it is
applied to the flesh of a petrified creature, it returns the creature to
flesh as the *stone to flesh* spell. If an ounce of it is applied to the
flesh of a nonpetrified creature, it protects the creature as a
*stoneskin* spell.

Strong abjuration and transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item,
*flesh to stone, stoneskin;* Price 4,000 gp per ounce.

### Strand of Prayer Beads
 This item appears to be a normal string of
prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell. Once that occurs, the
owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and how to activate
them. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a
different magic power.

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Special Bead Type   ||Special Bead Ability|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Bead of blessing    ||Wearer can cast *bless.*|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Bead of healing     ||Wearer can cast his choice of *cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness,* or *remove disease.*|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Bead of karma       ||Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes.|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Bead of smiting     ||Wearer can cast *chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath,* or *unholy blight* (Will DC 17 partial).|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Bead of summons     ||Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for one day. (If the wearer uses the *bead of summons* to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a *geas* upon him as punishment in the very least.)|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Bead of wind walking||Wearer can cast *wind walk.*|
| --- | --- | --- |
  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A *lesser strand of prayer beads* has a *bead of blessing* and a *bead
of healing.* A *strand of prayer beads* has a *bead of healing,* a *bead
of karma,* and a *bead of smiting.* A *greater strand of prayer beads*
has a *bead of healing,* a *bead of karma,* a *bead of summons,* and a
*bead of wind walking.*

Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the *bead of
summons,* which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The *beads
of blessing, smiting,* and *wind walking* function as spell trigger
items; the *beads of karma* and *summons* can be activated by any
character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or
wear the *strand of prayer beads* in any specific location, as long as
he carries it somewhere on his person.

The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand.
Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more
beads by the following amounts: *bead of blessing* --600 gp, *bead of
healing* --9,000 gp, *bead of karma* --20,000 gp, *bead of smiting*
--16,800 gp, *bead of summons* --20,000 gp, *bead of wind walking*

### Sustaining Spoon
 This unremarkable eating utensil is typically
fashioned from horn. If the spoon is placed in an empty container the
vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although this substance has a
flavor similar to that of warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing
and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous,
omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient
gruel each day to feed up to four humans.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *create food and water;*
Price 5,400 gp.

hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus of from +1
to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Intelligence score. Once

bonus, the reader will earn extra skill points when she attains a new
level.

### Unguent of Timelessness
 When applied to any matter that was once
alive this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time.
Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had
passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving
throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically
removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains
enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object
counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as two Large
objects.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; *Prerequisite:* Craft Wondrous Item; Price
150 gp.

ability, the character can use that ability one additional time each
day.

wild shape ability; Price 10,000 gp.

### Well of Many Worlds
 This strange, interdimensional device looks
just like a *portable hole.* Anything placed within it is immediately
cast to another world---a parallel world, another planet, or a different
plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, the random factor again
comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a
*portable hole* can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come
through the opening just as easily as from the initiating place. (It is
a two-way portal.)

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, *gate;* Price 82,000
gp.

### Wind Fan
 A *wind fan* appears to be nothing more than a wood and
papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By
uttering the command word, its possessor causes the fan to generate air
movement duplicating a *gust of wind* spell. The fan can be used once
per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20%
cumulative chance per usage during that day that the device tears into
useless, nonmagical tatters.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *gust of wind;* Price
5,500 gp.

### Wings of Flying
 A pair of these wings might appear to be nothing
more than a plain cloak of old, black cloth, or they could be as elegant
as a long cape of blue feathers. When the wearer speaks the command
word, the cloak turns into a pair of bat or bird wings that empower her
to fly with a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, *fly;* Price
54,000 gp;Weight 2 lb.
